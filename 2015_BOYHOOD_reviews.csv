BOYHOOD,1 November 2014,9/10,"""Boyhood"" is one of the most original films I have seen and when it was over, it left me wanting more--both signs that it was a terrific film. What is so original about it? Instead of making the film during the usual film schedule lasting a few months, this film was made over 11 years! So, instead of having multiple kids playing the same character, here we see the same child actor as he grows from age 7 to 18. Similar sorts of things have been done with the ""Up"" series, but these are documentary films. Here, it's a fictional snapshot of a boy's life--and it's so unusual that I strongly recommend you see it.As for the story, I will admit that it will not appeal to everyone. After all, like real life, some parts are slow and not particularly interesting. Additionally, many viewers will be turned off by seeing the realism--showing kids doing illegal or dangerous things, cursing, teenage sexuality and the like. Plus, a few might not like the political or religious messages that come in the film. However, this last point I could easily overlook as politics and religion ARE parts of real life and discussing them is appropriate to heighten the film's realism--even if you don't agree with the orientation. Overall, an exciting sort of picture--one that must be praised for the care and efforts taken to create such a groundbreaking project."
BOYHOOD,5 July 2016,8/10,"'Boyhood' has a very unique and intriguing concept, in fact there has not been a concept like it (with taking 12 years to make and being encompassed over 12 years as well). But that is not the only selling point of the film, despite what the detractors have unfairly said.Granted, 'Boyhood' is not for all tastes, although it was almost unanimously praised by critics the IMDb reviews are much more divisive. This reviewer totally understands why people dislike, even flat out hate it, and shares some of their criticisms, and generally hates the incredibly condescending way they have been expressed, nobody who legitimately liked 'Boyhood' for perfectly valid reasons wants to feel that it is a criminal offence to like it, let alone love it.Does this reviewer think it is quite as good as the hype and critics say? Not quite. Does she think it is a very good, conceptually daring and in some ways misunderstood film, and towards the better end of the films released in 2014? Yes. It does have its problems, it is a case of two inconsistent halves with a great emotion-filled, honest, nostalgic and richly developed first half and a second half where the pace slackens, the story meanders and there are moments of awkwardness.Ellar Coltrane's performance is also uneven, he is excellent in the first half with a real sense of honesty and integrity, where the protagonist is much more interesting and likable, but rather stilted and not as involved in the second half. The editing is also choppy in places and although a vast majority of the performances are fantastic Lorelei Linklater is somewhat dull as Samantha and would never pass for Mason's sister.However, aside from the editing 'Boyhood' looks very accomplished with evocative production values and is beautifully filmed. Richard Linklater directs with a real generosity and lightness of touch. The script honest, poignant, thought-provoking and sometimes harrowing, and while not everything about the story works it has a real sense of nostalgia and richly rewarding in its emotional content. Really do not agree that nothing happens, it has a long running time and is deliberate in pacing but this reviewer really loved 'Boyhood's' understatedness, sincerity and subtlety as well as its spontaneity.Characters are interesting and developed, especially Ethan Hawke's and Patricia Arquette's. Hawke and Arquette are also the standouts in the cast, and deservedly garnered Oscar nominations which Arquette won. Arquette is particularly outstanding, with a genuine fullness of emotion and authority with no sense of over-acting or self-indulgence. Hawke also gives a compelling real performance.In conclusion, a very intriguing and very good film. Not quite as good as it's hyped to be but it has many more merits than the detractors lead you to believe.While the criticisms are understandable, this reviewer is having a hard time believing that there are those who cite 'Boyhood' as the worst film they've ever seen, or one of them. There are far worse out there, that are amateurishly made, ineptly directed, terribly acted and written even worse, distinctions that regardless of whether you hate it 'Boyhood belongs nowhere near in any of them. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
BOYHOOD,8 November 2014,,"Boyhood (2014)**** (out of 4)For a non-documentary, you have to agree that Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is unlike any movie ever made. The idea of telling a coming-of-age story about a brother, sister and their parents and shoot it over an eleven year period is just something of genius or a train wreck. With someone like Linklater behind the project it could only turn out one way. The film follows Mason (Ellar Coltrane) as he grows from a young child until he enters college. Along the way we see the various ups and downs of his life with his mother (Patricia Arquette), father (Ethan Hawke) and sister (Lorelei Linklater).BOYHOOD had an incredible gimmick behind it. After all, in this day and age how could anyone do a project like this where the investors wouldn't see any money back for possibly over a decade. Not only that but what would have happened if in, say, year seven, something happened to one of the cast members. It would totally ruin the film or drastic changes would have to be made (especially had something happened to the actor). A lot of times these gimmick films only work because of the gimmick but that's not the case here. Again, we're dealing with one of the greatest filmmakers out there.What's so special about this film is that anyone watching it is going to be able to connect with something on the screen. Plus, the added benefit is seeing an actor kid age in front of our eyes. The coming-of-age genre has been beaten to death so many times that coming up with a new way to show it was just pure genius and it works. It's hard to believe that you can actually follow this families struggles from one year to the next. Seeing the boy's voice change. See his body change. See him go from a boy to a teenager to a young adult. With Hawke and Arquette you know you're going to get great work. The real highlight is seeing Coltrane go through these various stages and actually be able to deliver a real performance. I think it's fair to say that he becomes a better actor as the movie goes on and when the story really starts to focus on him, towards the end, you're seeing a really special performance. The entire cast are certainly at the top of their game and you really do see them as a family and not just a bunch of actors doing roles.BOYHOOD will probably never be matched due to countless production reasons. If you thought Linklater's ""BEFORE"" trilogy was something special, this here really takes things into a whole new direction and while I'd say the story is far from flawless, there's no question that this is one of the bravest, most unique and rather inspiring movies ever made."
BOYHOOD,12 March 2015,8/10,"Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) are kids to single mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) in Texas. Their dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) comes in and out of their lives. Olivia gets remarried to her professor Bill Welbrock who has two kids of his own. Bill turns out to be an abusive drunk. They would leave that situation and move on.Filmmaker Richard Linklater follows Mason from 6 year old to 18 when he's about to go to college. The story meanders. When drunk driving Bill almost kills the kids and doesn't, I realize that this is not about some big dramatic turn. It's life that isn't overly dramatized. It doesn't have a traditional movie plot. It definitely has Linklater's indie sensibilities. The standout performance is Patricia Arquette. Her character has more compelling growth and more compelling scenes. She is fearless and straight forward. She is the emotional center of this movie more than Coltrane. He is not necessarily a natural actor. He works well as a kid but not as well as an older teen. The good thing is that Linklater is not new at filming amateur actors. He is able to maintain the lead into his bitter angry teen years."
BOYHOOD,14 March 2015,6/10,"I didn't have any problem getting to the end of this film. I'm a patient man and I like documentaries and slice of life drama. All these people rating this a one out of ten are taking this so personally. Let's face it. Every new wave in anything has doubters. I did look at my watch from time to time, but I really had some interest in the people portrayed here. Life can be hard at times and we do make bad choices. The question that is fundamental to this is pretty simple: ""If this film had been made with a lead who was close to 18 years old and his younger incarnations were played by actors who were carefully cast to look like they could have been him, would that make it a lesser film. I do have some problems with them bothering to go through all that effort to do what they did. Imagine he expense and the riskiness of what was done. Did the end product live up to effort expended. For me, the jury is still out. I didn't find the principle character all that engaging. He is the strong silent type (like a young Matt Damon) and he is full of ideas, but as far as doing something with them, it falls pretty silent. I will need to digest this more, I guess."
BOYHOOD,22 December 2015,,"it is not easy say why. because not the story or performances are the important part, not the locations or dialogs.but, in strange manner, the atmosphere. the same atmosphere from many other films who propose honesty as the most important target of the each scene. ambitious project, Boyhood propose the ordinary life, every day life as only subject. and it does a real admirable work. not surprising. because the ages of Ellar Coltrane are not only pieces of realistic cinema but a special exercise to define America in different periods, to use the characteristic of ages to define social dilemmas, to define family's relationship, to remind old American cinema flavor from crisis periods. a film about nothing. at the first view. precious for its lost of precise message and idealistic roots."
BOYHOOD,16 October 2014,8/10,"And looking at the effort and the standard set by ""Boyhood"", there probably won't be many movies like this in the future either. This film was written and directed by Richard Linklater over the course of 12 years with a core of actors, who kept playing their parts as they grew older. If you are a bit familiar with Linklater's other works, you will know that the best way you could maybe describe him as a filmmaker is non-action. There are no huge events or great happenings that change everything for everybody in his films. The only thing that happens is life: moving places, school, first love, sex education, special talents and the most severe thing you get to witness here is domestic violence. It is a slow and steady process which works so well though as you can identify with the characters thanks to their imperfection and their ""normality"".The film is very long, almost three hours, which is pretty much the length of the first two ""Before...""-films taken together. Not a surprise though if you look how long they took for making this one. They met 3-4 days each year for twelve years and this is the final result. Consequently, we do not only see the central character growing up, but also his mother, father and sister (played by director Linklater's daughter Lorelei) getting older. The acting is convincing. Arquette and Hawke are considered options for the supporting categories at the Oscars, but I would not go that far. Arquette is more of a lead anyway in my opinion and unfortunately her final scene and possibly emotional highlight left me rather unattached. Hawke does a solid job, but the only real advantage he has over the other men (the professor and the ex-soldier) in Arquette's character's life is that he has much more screen time. They all played their parts very well. Another thing I really enjoyed here are the many contemporary references. These make it really worth watching. To mention two, there is for example the huge Britney Spears hype back in the day depicted by Lorelei's character's singing or the Harry Potter mania.Finally, my favorite scene probably was when they were all together singing at the house of the parents of Hawke's character's wife. Really an emotional highlight of togetherness. This film definitely is a must-see. It did not drag a single second during its massive runtime."
BOYHOOD,22 March 2015,6/10,"Richard Linklater's Boyhood filmed over the span of 12 years featuring the life of young Mason (and to a lesser extent, his sister) from boyhood until the verge of adulthood. His parents are divorced, his dad comes to see them at some weekends, they move house, sometimes forcibly as one of the step-dad's turns out to be a violent alcoholic.As he becomes older Mason becomes a bit of a goth and supposedly aimless. His mom still has difficulties to sustain long term relationships, his dad has remarried and had children from his second wife. The Mason at the end of the film with an interest in photography, working in a fast food outlet, about to go away to college still has not realised what he wants in life.There is no straight narrative, no overarching plot which has upset some critics. There are plenty of set ups where you think the film would go one way and they do not go anywhere. What you could say Chekhov's guns that remain unfired. In a sense the film shows the randomness of life where people and situations flit in and out.Observations I would make that the film does feel at times like a slog. I think the film does not entirely succeed and looks more like an experimental film. Linklater has form with the Sunrise/Sunset films with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. However as it was being filmed the characters discuss current events around the time it happened from 9/11 to the Iraq invasion to Obama's election victory.When I was a teenager I had trouble walking and chewing gum at the same time I can relate to the issues facing Mason as a teenager. It looks like growing up today still throws up the same concerns now than it did during my time. You muddle through life and so do your parents who you thought would know better.The film speaks about the ambiguous status of the family unit in modern society with half siblings, step siblings, step fathers, live in partner's especially when these relations break apart. At one point we see Mason's mother living with an ex-soldier, it seems they were never married and he was at one point taking care of the family. Maybe this is all part of what it is like to live in 21st century America.When Mason's mother leaves her second husband due to his alcohol fuelled abuse, she leaves the house with Mason and his sister but leaves his own two children behind with him. She tells them that she has contacted social services but you never find out what happened to those two kids and it looks that Mason and his sister never had further contact with them even though they got on well and of course as the years go on we have the rise of social networking sites. Surely they would have Facebooked each other.The randomness of life is reinforced where we see a plumber who is encouraged by Mason's mum to go to college who pops up many years later. It seems he took her advice and bettered himself.There is no doubt that Boyhood is an ambitious film project. An intriguing premise which has left some people raving about it, others dismissing it as empty and boring. I am in the middle, a film that has something to offer but does not always deliver."
BOYHOOD,7 December 2018,5/10,"When I first read the DVD cover I was convinced I wouldn't like it. But after all the hype and Best Picture win I had to force myself to watch a story about a typical kid growing up. Now the film seems to imply mom's (Patricia Arquette) bad men choices may be in part at fault for Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) typically irresponsible choices. However Mason reminds me of my nephew, who may be in or out of rehab when you read this, and he's had the same parents all of his life. 30 minutes into the film, I was moaning that I had 2 hours left. Please get better. Mom meets a college professor in one scene and they are married in the next, apparently not enough time to figure out he had a drinking problem. The kid's divorced father (Ethan Hawke) was still in his boyhood, but was more likeable than mom.Good performance about real life? Sure. Good enough to bore me to tears.Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity."
BOYHOOD,5 November 2014,9/10,"Obviously as others have stated too, this is as close to someone growing up as has been depicted on film. The director took risk, by making this a work in progress over 12 years for many reasons. You have to make schedule that is fitting for the actors to come back from time to time and while everyone was obviously committed (and fortunately talented, which is sometimes tough to foresee in young actors), there is also something no one can control: Death! There are digital solutions nowadays of course, but that wouldn't really fit the budget.But it never came to that, though the film can be as depressing at times (or overall depending on your view). It's not always sunshine and you don't get easy solutions for every problem that occurs. Having the movie span 12 years is a task that is being accomplished well enough, but you can't show everything. Even with almost 3 hours running time there is always something that has to be left out. If this is your cup of tea or not, is something only you know best ..."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,8/10,"As a cinematic work spanning a twelve year time frame, I'll grant that this was a novel approach and one that required a great deal of patience and courage for a film maker to undertake. Having seen the film though, I don't understand what the fuss is all about. This story of a young boy growing up from the age of seven until about eighteen or so is largely uninspiring, even uneventful if one cares to look at the film objectively. This may have been the point right along, I don't know, but stringing it out for almost three hours, while not entirely boring, really failed to move me in any way.I have a theory about this. If you're under say thirty years of age or so, this picture will 'resonate', there's a popular word, for all the reasons that one can define under the term 'lack of experience'. By the time the principal character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) achieves his high school graduation, he's gone through a variety of family and life experiences that leave him uncertain and confused. He sees everyone stuck in an in-between state on the way to knowing or becoming, but never actually getting there. This is even more of a surprise for his Mom (Patricia Arquette), who after three failed marriages wonders ""I just thought...there would be more"".Now as for myself, I'm over sixty and have gone through all this self analysis and contemplation, and have arrived comfortably at a point where this is how life is for the most part. Not wanting to sound cynical, I don't want to browbeat the 'follow your heart' stuff or cast aspersions on the musical partners life style of the adult characters in the piece, but when you stop and look around, this is what goes on every day in your life and mine with no fanfare. Just like in this movie, but we don't get an Academy award.More than anything else, you know what bugged me about the picture. Here I go again, but what a novel idea it would be to keep politics out of it. In typical Hollywood fashion you have your Bush bashing by Dad (Ethan Hawke), later to be replaced by the fervent campaigning of Mason with his 'Obama/Biden' lawn signs. This by itself would make the movie a Best Picture contender, if not insuring a win in at least a category or two. Having seen ""Birdman"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""The Imitation Game"", they all have this one beat, but as they say, I've been wrong before.So as I go on and on here, a thought just occurred to me. You know what would have really made this whole concept even more stunning? Why not spin off the story of sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) at a certain point, and co-produce a second picture called ""Girlhood"". Up until their teen years, the movie was as much about her as Mason, so why not go for a two-fer? Her father director would have been hailed as even more of a genius, unlike myself, who in the tradition of George Carlin, just likes to think up goofy stuff."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,7/10,"The life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18.I do not want to be the part pooper, but this film has received near-universal acclaim and a ridiculous amount of nominations. And why? Because the concept is brilliant. It really is, and for that Richard Linklater can proudly take home an award. But is it a good film? That seems much harder to say. Without the gimmick, this would just be a long film with little plot. Sure, we can say it is everyday life, but what does that mean? Both Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette have nominations, which seems bizarre... Hawke is good, but this is far from his best work. Arquette is also good, but Oscar-worthy? Maybe not."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,10/10,"Before seeing ""Boyhood"", I'd seen a number of Richard Linklater's movies, each of which I've liked. I already had high expectations for Linklater's newest effort, and it didn't disappoint. Filmed over 12 years, it shows the trials and tribulations of a boy as he ages. But no matter what happens to him - including his mom's marriage to an abusive drunk - he finds a way to keep going. ""Boyhood"" could be a look at any person's childhood, since we've all had unpleasant experiences in our lives.I would say that the most impressive cast members are Patricia Arquette as the mom trying to settle down, and Linklater regular Ethan Hawke as the dad who likes having children as long as he doesn't have to be responsible for them. I would say that they both deserve Oscars for their performances. But the overall point is that ""Boyhood"" is one of the year's best. I recommend it to everyone. As for Ellar Coltrane, I hope to see him in more movies, and I have very high expectations for Richard Linklater's next movie."
BOYHOOD,29 January 2015,9/10,"BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Richard Linklater (Slacker, Before Sunrise, School of Rock) has done many well written human dramas focusing on time passing, and I have seen many films about characters growing up, but this one takes the concept a fantastic new direction. Basically in Texas, in 2002, six year old Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, Richard's daughter) live with single mother Olivia (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Patricia Arquette), she has an argument with her boyfriend and moves the family to Houston so she can attend and complete her degree at university, and find a job. Mason's father, Mason Sr. (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ethan Hawke) visits the children and takes them bowling, after giving his opinion on the Iraq War he explains why he has been away so much, he promises to spend more time with them, but dropping them off he and Olivia argue, and Mason sees his mother flirting with her professor Bill Welbrock (Marco Perella). By 2005, Olivia and Bill have married and blended their two families, including Bill's two children from his previous marriage, together they play video games and attend the release of the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. By 2006, Mason Sr. gets to bond more with the children, taking then to a baseball game and sleeping over at his house with musician roommate Jimmy (Charlie Sexton), Olivia meanwhile continues her education and initially is supportive with Bill's style of strict parenting, this includes increased chores and cutting Mason's hair. By 2007 however Bill is an alcoholic and has drink taking over his life, making him abusive towards his family, it is after assaulting Olivia and threatening the safety of the children that Olivia moves out with Mason and Samantha, and files for divorce. By 2008, Samantha has found herself a new boyfriend, Mason Sr. finds out and talks to her about contraception, Mason and her sister go house to house helping the campaign for Barack Obama to become President, Mason Sr. and Mason Jr. go camping together at Pedernales Falls State Park, bonding over music, Star Wars and Mason's growing interest in girls. By 2009, Mason and Samantha have settled into their lives in San Marcos, a town close to Austin, Mason is being bullied in school and teased on a camping trip, but he is gaining attention from girls, Olivia meanwhile is teaching psychology at college and has moved in with new boyfriend, veteran of the Afghanistan/Iraq War and student Jim (Brad Hawkins). In 2010, Mason celebrates his fifteenth birthday, experiments with marijuana and alcohol, Mason Jr. has remarried and has a baby and takes Mason and Samantha to meet his wife's parents, Mason Jr. gives his son a suit and a Beatles solo songs mix CD, while his step-grandparents give him a personalised Bible and vintage shotgun, and young Mason becomes interested in photography. In 2001, Mason gets a lecture from his photography teacher, who sees potential in his work but no ambition, Mason meets a girl named Sheena (Zoe Graham) while attending a party, she becomes his girlfriend, Olivia meanwhile leaves Jim, who while drinking confronts Mason about his home arrivals at late hours. In 2012, Samantha is attending the University of Texas at Austin, Mason and Sheena go to visit, talk about their hopes and fears about college and stay up late to watch the sun come up, they are caught by Samantha's dorm roommate sleeping together. By 2013, Mason is in his high school senior year, he has a painful breakup from Sheena after she cheats on him, in a state photography contest he wins the silver medal and is awarded college scholarship money, his family throw a graduation party and toast his success, Mason Sr. gives him advice about his breakup, and Olivia plans to move out again and asks Mason and Samantha to sort through their possessions. Mason is preparing to leave for college, Olivia breaks down, disillusioned how fast time has flown by and claims that all that is left for her is her death, but Mason comforts her before leaving the apartment, he moves into Sul Ross State University in Alpine and meets new dorm roommate Dalton (Maximillian McNamara), his girlfriend Barb (Taylor Weaver) who gives him shrooms, and her roommate Nicole (Jessi Mechler), the four friends go hiking to Big Bend Ranch State Park, Mason and Nicole talk about seizing the moment, Mason telling that they are always in moment. Also starring Evie Thompson as Jill, Jenni Tooley as Annie, Tamara Jolaine as Tammy, Nick Krause as Charlie, Jordan Howard as Tony and Sam Dillon as Nick. The direction and writing of Linklater is great, with pace and realism well thought out, Coltrane starting at age six and ending at age eighteen is a great choice for the boy we see grow on screen, as well as Linklater's daughter as his sister, credit also goes to Arquette as the quietly heroic and somewhat troubled single mother, and Hawke is really likable as the often visiting father. Everyday by Michael Winterbottom was filmed over five years with a similar concept, but this film started earlier and was filmed over a period of twelve years, what is clever is not just seeing the actors ageing on screen, but the story is made up of not many significant moments, more the moments in between, with cultural events and music of the time casually used to keep it flowing, it is a really likable definitely must see coming-of-age drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year (beaten by Birdman), Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
BOYHOOD,3 May 2015,5/10,"Two siblings in Texas town are uprooted by their single mother, who hopes a move to Houston will lead to better work and more opportunities. They become a blended family when their mother marries a (hard-drinking) single man with two children, with visits from the kids' ne'er-do-well father, who lives nearby and is typically unemployed. Writer-producer-director Richard Linklater spent over 10 years on this project, which has loosely-structured scenes of 'natural' interaction between bored, video-game playing teenagers and their busy, frequently exasperated elders. Little details about behavior and extracurricular activities certainly ring true, but Linklater has trouble extracting real emotions from these episodes (this due primarily to the variable acting talent assembled, and also Linklater's lackadaisical approach, which some may find raw and real). The film purports to be honest--and there doesn't seem to be an agenda beyond holding up a mirror to the audience--but some viewers may end up feeling resentful. There's no dramatic pull through this story, and it's a lengthy film (165 minutes). Patricia Arquette won a Supporting Actress Oscar for her dryly-resolved work (she's the best thing in the movie), but Ethan Hawke is still trying too hard to be wily and charming. ** from ****"
BOYHOOD,1 February 2015,,"This is a unique and thoughtful way to make a movie. From the title we know it focuses on a boy, and his boyhood from about 6 to about 18. It uses the same four main actors, so we actually see the boy and his sister growing up, as the actors are the same all the way through. Including the mom and dad.The boy in question is Ellar Coltrane as Mason, Jr., a couple of years older, is Lorelei Linklater (the writer/director's daughter) as Sam (Samantha). Their parents are Patricia Arquette as Mom and Ethan Hawke as Dad, Mason, Sr. As happens so often a couple get pregnant and then married young before they really have a chance to establish who they are and what they want out of life. Then just a few years in they divorce because of miscellaneous incompatibilities. This is what happens in this story, and the mom has a series of moves and a couple more husbands, all the while doing her best to raise the kids.The overall arc of the story is interesting, and it ends after Mason has turned 18 and starts college, the girl he is with makes the comment, about the old cliché' of ""sieze the moment"" when she observes ""The moment seizes us."" And it appears that Mason is starting to figure out where he might want to go in life, flavored with all he experienced growing up, advice his dad or mom or a teacher might have given him in appropriate circumstances. This movie can't help remind one of the ""UP"" series where a group of British boys and girls are filmed every seven years starting at age seven. But that is real life and we see them growing up at 7-year intervals. This one is unique in being a fictional take on one boy's growing up."
BOYHOOD,22 May 2015,10/10,"Unlike most films about the life of someone growing up throughout, this one actually has the same actor playing the leading role through 12 years of his life while his character goes through those same years as evidenced by many of the real-life events sometimes depicted in the film. Ellar Coltrane is fine as Mason, who we first meet when he's about 6 and then see him go through high school before concluding when he starts college. Lorelei Linklater, daughter of the film's writer/director Richard Linklater, is his older sister Samantha. And then there are his estranged parents, played by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette who ends up being the one who raises them. Both Hawke and Arquette got Oscar nominations though only Arquette won which she deserved. The film could be both a little harrowing due to some personality conflicts depicted and also heartwarming when Mason discovers some truths from some of his relationships. Director Linklater has really created a fine slice-of-life piece. So on that note, I highly recommend Boyhood."
BOYHOOD,3 May 2015,8/10,"If it weren't for the fact, that we're talking about presidential elections of 2004 and 2008, I really thought we were visiting a family of the 1960s.The film was overly long. How did her second marriage go awry so quickly. We see a reformation in character from amiable college professor, to strict father to a father totally out of control. Once she leaves him, he and his children from his prior marriage are never seen again in the film. He was certainly an interesting character and perhaps needed more attention drawn to him.In the credits, Patricia Arquette is listed first and yet she won the best supporting actress Oscar. The academy has never established rules about this.Wonderful that the film had no violence and there are no serious upheavals in people getting physically hurt.Ellar Coltrane is magnificent as the son who comes into his own. He seems to be hesitant on life, but yet endures. Ditto for his mother, Arquette, who goes through 2 divorces in the film and yet returns to college to collect degrees and ultimately teach.We see people in Texas actually for President Obama's election and we see a family in conflict that ultimately is victorious in fighting adversities.Another excellent performance is by Ethan Hawke, Arquette's first husband in the film who goes from a 23 year old married rebel to a middle-age lord fearing man making his way in the world."
BOYHOOD,4 January 2015,,"This film tells the story of a young boy growing up into an adult, seeing his world through a space of twelve years.It's the first film I know of that is shot over such a long time. The first half of the movie, namely the boy's life from six to fifteen, is very good. We see his life fly by in about ninety minutes. Every little scene has a significance, even a one second scene conveys important message. I find it quite brilliant. The second half, from fifteen to eighteen years of age, drags on a bit. I thought that if it is as tightly edited as the first half, the film would have been great. Overall, it's a special film that will be remembered for a long time."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2017,3/10,"Tracking a boys life over 10 years. It's a simple idea, that this film tries to mine for gold.And it almost works. It's obviously a film that engages you, and the music in between gives the audience a sense of time passing in the wider world, not just in the life of the boy.I did find it a little sweary though, and overlong as well. I appreciate that the film makers were trying to be as authentic as possible, but it alienated me as a viewer.It was deserving of awards, but perhaps not all the hype."
BOYHOOD,12 March 2015,8/10,"A non-traditional project from writer/director Richard Linklater. A twelve year undertaking using the same cast of characters throughout. Following a divorce, a mother(Patricia Arquette)and father(Ethan Hawke)try their best to guide their young son Mason(Ellar Coltrane)through childhood, adolescence to young adulthood. Lorelei Linklater(the writer/director's daughter)plays Mason's overly pretentious little sister Samantha. Mason's dad was just not the kind to really be there for him; although seeing him when he could. Mason's mom always trying to hold the unit together, but seemingly to have bad judgment in picking husbands. As time rolls on the relationships evolve a bit dysfunctional, but manageable.There are the trials and tribulations of family dinners, birthday celebrations, graduations; Mason most seemingly a pedestrian slowly moving through life at his own speed and with questionable ambition. But a survivor nonetheless. Character development is interesting. The story may seem boring to some. And at times it feels like picking up pieces of a puzzle hoping there are none missing. Growing up and parenting appears to progress at the same rate. BOYHOOD goes through the years with a very good soundtrack of/for life. The music provided comes from diverse genres represented by artists like: Coldplay,The Flaming Lips, Cheryl Crow, Paul McCartney & Wings, Bob Dylan, Lady Gaga, Arcade Fire and George Harrison.Coltrane and Arquette are outstanding. Also featured in the cast: Elijah Smith, Marco Peralta, Steven Prince, Andrew Villarreal, Tess Allen, Jamie Howard and Libby Villari."
BOYHOOD,25 August 2014,,"When I watch a reasonably well built film, I cruise at two levels. One is the excellence of how I am captured by the way the narrative unfolds in a world I am seduced into maintaining (and possibly cocreating). The other gliding level has to do with how well I value that world.Sometimes this focuses on the story itself, but usually for me we are talking about how deeply the surrounding, often just implicit, world has affected me. And whether I want to incorporate it into my worlds in some way. Herzog for instance. His early films are profoundly affecting. The best of these are those that have the least of him in them. Once he got control of the wild process he pioneered, you start to see his world become clear. That world is much like his style: It has a stylized plateau from which it can observe itself, introspective and formal. But the ground of reality is capricious, dangerous. Fate is angry and you enter expecting to be hurt. Once a foot is placed here, you can never fully escape, you can only retreat temporarily to beautifully see the damage, or potential damage. I still watch the man.I can trust him to engage me and take me where I would not go. Uncomfortable places. But it is real work afterward to tease out who I am and how my world is different. I get something like this with Linklater. He is a natural cinematic storyteller, and has been from the beginning. And now we have this remarkable film. It really deserves a very, very long life and all the celebration I see. It truly grabbed me and almost always I did not feel unfairly captured. Simple proximity beats drama any day if you can do it. Tension in repose has power; personal explosions can fill a screen quota but seldom touch. This does. Oh, I have some quibbles about how the characters are tiered. We have our central kids who own the world we enter. This is as genuine as it gets in film. We have the two parents. Now this is background existence. We accept that because they are real as well, but real in a more filmic sense. Ethan Hawke is so trustworthy in this, I marvel. But we get a different world than that of the kids, and that's deliberate. The third tier are the extra husbands, friends, other relatives, teachers and bosses. Now these are ordinary narrative scaffolding, with traditional speeches borrowed from ordinary movies in tone and style. The kids are more real in this construction because the other tiers are not. But still, I got impatient as some of this went on. The real dilemma after entering Linklater's world and having it penetrate: what of it to use? What of it to respect as true in the tiers we build internally to live in? Do I place it where the filmmaker has, as the way things are. The moment seizes us, and the best we can do is immerse and record? Linklater himself plays with these questions in some other projects and obliquely references them here as 'psychology.' And he sets distance from ordinary viewers by setting it in Texas. A pledge allegiance to Texas? Or do we take this, as I have today, as a background drama, being one reality among others that we gather to illuminate a life? I think this is what Malick intends in his similar project. Cinema must move relentlessly; this nature cannot be escaped. The viewer must accept the world in the way and at the pace the filmmaker decides. This is a contract. But it comes with costs that prevent us mapping our real, true reality to that of a film that works to present a real, true one. We always have to shift it to one of the surrounding spheres we inhabit. This is a three."
BOYHOOD,10 April 2015,7/10,"Wow ! Some film maker has the radical idea of making a film where a boy turns in to a young man ""Calm down Theo . You know that's been done before . Wasn't all that long ago you watched Scorsese's movie Kundun a biopic on some loopy religious leader and that was of a similar technique"" Ah yes but here's the big difference: Instead of getting different actors to play the characters all the characters are played by the same actors as the story progresses through a decade and a half . What a fantastic , ambitious and unique idea and you can see why award voters were falling over themselves to nominate and reward director Richard Linklater . There was an absolute buzz surrounding this film down to its originality . Now that the award season has been and gone it's time to step back and judge it for what it is rather than how it was madeTo be honest much of its praise is down to what happened behind the scenes and all the difficulties that must have involved rather than dramatic developments unfolding on screen . The story which plays out for almost three hours revolve around Mason a young boy experiencing what it's like to jump from childhood to adolescence . It' a simple coming of age story and not much more than that . It's slightly episodic and nothing really happens that will have you gasping ""Wow what a great scene , I'm almost in tears due to the emotional impact this movie is having upon me"" . It's rather empty and shallow and nothing really happens . I know there's an element of realist cinema gong on but there's such a thing as too much realism and the audience aren't really being asked to invest any great emotion in to the characters and I did think Mason was a rather lucky lower middle class lad and couldn't really identify his teen years with my own . That said if you're a fan of indie cinema you'll probably love this and for such a very long film I didn't find myself looking at my watch so I guess BOYHOOD gets a generous 7/10 but it's a movie much easier to admire as a piece of film making than enjoy as a story"
BOYHOOD,4 September 2014,9/10,"Wonderful, innovative movie. Of course, the first thing you know about the movie is that it was filmed using the same cast over 12 years. An incredibly original and daring feat from writer/director Richard Linklater. So many things could have gone wrong over those 12 years that would have made the movie not eventuate. But eventuate it did, and the end product is wonderful.In following a boy's aging from 6 to 18 years we see him grow and mature before our eyes. Reminds us of our our childhood, its trials, tribulations, discoveries, highs and lows. We don't just see his progress, but that of his family and friends too. Incredibly realistic.As a character-driven movie, the plot is mostly secondary, but it is hardly dull. You are so drawn in by the characters that you care about everything that happens to them, down to minor things. This said, Linklater doesn't allow the movie to get bogged down or drift. Most of the plot might of a domestic nature, but it is certainly not boring.You wouldn't know the movie is almost three hours long, it moves along so briskly.Only negatives would be that I didn't find the boy's personality overly likable as he grew up, and some of his pretentious musings just seemed like padding. Also, there were one or two scenes we could have done without (eg guns as birthday presents).One of the more innovative movies you'll see, and wonderful to watch."
BOYHOOD,30 August 2014,8/10,". . . then you'll probably be giving the golden statuette itself to BOYHOOD. After all, BOYHOOD's 165-minute running time beats THE TREE OF LIFE's bladder test by 26 minutes. While BOYHOOD may be told in a more linear fashion than THE TREE OF LIFE, its special effects budget is much lower. No Universes are born in BOYHOOD. Neither film features much in the way of stuff designed to keep you on the edge of your seat (other than their length, which prompted lots of bathroom-trip traffic at each of my showings). At least at the end of TITANIC audience members feel the fight NOT to go was worth it, as they witnessed history. On the other hand, BOYHOOD is carefully crafted to make viewers feel especially sad that they did not spend this 165 minutes teaching a son or nephew to throw a knuckleball or to catch a football, instead of watching actors do it all. If I spread three months of work over twelve years, my paychecks would get cut off about eight days into the process. Isn't it cool to have a job where this is called Great Art?"
BOYHOOD,19 July 2014,9/10,"BOYHOOD (2014) ***1/2 Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Lorelei Linklater. Filmmaker Richard Linklater's boldest and this-close to a masterpiece film depicting a boy's youth brought before your eyes with a genuine gimmick: filming in linear real-time over the course of 13 years of one clear-eyed yet amiable boy named Mason (newcomer Coltrane supporting the weight of the world on his tender shoulders with élan and effortless grace) whose life being bounced around the great state of Texas with his well-meaning yet struggling mother (Arquette in her finest role to date) and loving yet feckless father (Hawke, equally acquitting himself nice and low-key here) as well as dealing with all the pitfalls and opportunities youth entails. With warmth, humor, dead-on accurate dialogue and unique joie de vivre the film unspools in a non-rushed near three hours running time with effortless ease and carefree bliss - which also seems to arguably be its problem: there's very little drama or crisis involved in what is a remarkable lifespan of adolescence. The strengths are in its acting, directing and storytelling for the most part (Coltrane as he gets older feels like a natural actor) yet there is the nagging part of is this all that there is? Maybe that's the point. Whatever the case may be it is a tale worth telling and seeing. And living. And yes that is Linklater's real-life daughter as the older sister."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,10/10,"A truly special movie of the kind that doesn't come around very often.""Boyhood"" has a groundbreaking gimmick (Richard Linklater filmed it over 12 years so that we watch the characters in the film age in real time), but it doesn't feel like a gimmick movie. In fact, I could very easily see someone who doesn't know anything about it not even wondering how the young actor so convincingly ages throughout, so seamless is the film.It's three hours long but could have been three hours longer as far as I was concerned. There aren't BIG moments in the film -- it's instead a quiet masterpiece that follows the lives of a handful of characters as they navigate relationships, school, friends, insecurities, basically all of the things that bring all of us joy, heartache, worry, fear and happiness. The film's conclusion is that all lives are made up of small, even insignificant moments, that when pieced together and looked back on through the lens of experience, are, in their own way, little works of art. As is this movie.Grade: A+"
BOYHOOD,3 July 2014,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. The trick here is to convey enough without ruining anything. No, it's not a movie filled with twists and mystery, but rather it's a journey unlike we have previously seen on screen. Director Richard Linklater is known for his fascination with time as a key element in movies. Of course, that's obvious in his ""Before"" trilogy (the same two characters from 1995-2013), but think also of Dazed and Confused, School of Rock, and Bernie. The passage of time is crucial in each, but Boyhood takes it to a whole new level.Linklater and the 4 main characters have congregated and filmed a few days each year ... for 12 years. We watch a fictionalized family mark the passage of time. You might be familiar with director Michael Apted's excellent ""Up"" documentary series, where he reunites with his same group of people every 7 years. In Linklater's experiment, we watch Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, Richard's real life daughter) progress from adolescence to college age in under 3 hours. If you are a parent, you have experienced the quick passage of time when it comes to watching your kids grow. It's incredibly emotional to watch a young, fresh faced Mason grow into a college aged young man right in front of us.Linklater certainly got lucky with the two kids he cast at young ages. Their development and commitment to the project is the heart of the film. And if that weren't enough, we also see Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as their mom and dad through the years. Although they are separated when the film begins, we witness the changes each go through in their own lives. This is evolution, not creation. We don't get a new actor at each stage, instead we witness the transformations of all four.Patricia Arquette's character is a solid mom, while at the same time attempting to figure out her own life. Her less-than-stellar choices in men have quite the influence on Mason and Samantha ... the most dramatic being Ted (Steven Chester Prince) who sinks deeper into frustration, depression, alcoholism and anger. It's a thankless role, but it's a guy we have all known in life.So the film is about parenthood, childhood, adulthood, and family relationships. It's about the moments in time - the snapshots that become the fiber of our being. The shaping of people is an ongoing process and adult drama plays a role for all ages. As character flaws are exposed, choices are made that have a lasting impact.The passage of time is relayed not just through the kids looking older, but also through the usage of technology, music and pop culture. All 4 of the main actors are excellent, but Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane are truly exceptional. Though the film is not a traditional narrative, it would be wonderful if both received some awards attention. They are that good.A nod of appreciation should go out to IFC for taking the risk on such an unusual project. Linklater offers up an experiment WITH time, rather than an experiment IN time. Most studios would not be patient for 12 years, but their risk clearly pays off with something that must be experienced to really understand. My hope is that many will give this one a shot, and feel appreciative of all those involved for their willingness to put up funding ... or just as importantly, their time."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2015,10/10,"Through this groundbreaking piece of cinema, we simply follow a boy named Mason as he progresses from age 6 to 18 and deals with typical travails of childhood.These include things like his parents' divorce, bad step-parents, falling in love, finding his artistic voice, and fighting with his bratty older sister........Whenever a year ends with a number 4 on the end, a new piece of cinematic genius is released and will be remembered forever.2004 gave us Shaun Of The Dead1994 gave us Pulp Fiction and Shawshank.1984 gave us Ghostbusters and The Terminator1974 gave us The Exorcist, and so on and so on...And now 2014 has given us this masterpiece, and my gosh, is it one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made? It's an amazing feat that Linklater has pulled off, not only is it a narratively brilliant film, but the dedication of absolutely everyone involved makes this one of the most important films of the 21st century.By the end of the film, you feel like you are part of Masons family because we have not seen, we have accompanied him in the most important stages of his childhood.We are there when his mother makes bad decisions (the most brilliant part of the film), when he is bullied, when he falls in love, when he is used, and finally when he graduates.It's as is the film gives us, allows us to have the empathy that Masons parents have for him. The scene where his parents have a photo taken with him after graduation has to be one of the most uplifting things I have experienced at the cinema.If you haven't seen this, I strongly urge you to see it, its a modern master piece, and the best film of 2014."
BOYHOOD,15 March 2015,5/10,"To quote a line from the main character of BOYHOOD, Mason 'So what's the point?' Dad: 'Of what?' Mason: 'I don't know, any of this. Everything.' For those who are expecting something sonically spectacular form this near 3 hour ennui written and directed by Richard Linklater. The hype for the film nearly erased the desire to sit through it. According to the makers of the film, the synopsis reads 'Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.'It is a good idea – stretching a film over 12 years so that we can watch everyone age and witness the contemporary fragility of family life and the omnipresent theme of coming of age – and there are indeed some fine performances by Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Ellar Coltrane. But the film comes across as a promo gimmick and runs out of gas after about an hour."
BOYHOOD,20 July 2014,8/10,"I'll say upfront that I was a little disappointed in this, but that's mostly because I had the highest of expectations for it. It is, of course, the film that Richard Linklater's been making for the past 12 years, gathering his crew for a short while every year so we could observe its characters age over the course of the movie's 166 minute runtime. While that doesn't sound like it might work narratively, it does, surprisingly well. The experiment is a success! I have a few problems with it, though. First off, there are two different step-fathers in the life of the two main children (Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater). Both turn out to have the same flaw, alcoholism. In real life, this is perfectly possible, but in a story this came off to me as a bit repetitive. The bigger problem, to me, was that, when we spend time with Coltrane as a teenager, well, he's kind of a pretentious kid. Again, this is true to life. Even the smartest of teenagers comes off as pretentious to an adult - I think you pretty much have to pretend to be smart before you're actually smart. The thing is, though, it's no fun to listen to. Plus, I feel like Linklater, who of course wrote the dialogue, was trying to walk the line between its being the kind of thing a teenager might say and something that's actually profound, and too often it just comes off as boring teenage blathering. Most everything else in the film works, though. Most of the vignettes are very well done. The two parents, Ethan Hawke as the deadbeat dad who successfully reintegrates himself into his children's lives and Patricia Arquette as the long-suffering single mother, are both beautifully written and expertly performed. This is easily one of Hawke's finest performances. He reminded me so much of my own dad I had to love him. Arquette has a somewhat more cliché role, but she does wonders with it."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2016,7/10,Well even though drama's are not really my kind of movies I enjoyed watching Boyhood. But the most brilliant thing about it is not the movie itself but the long time project they had to make this movie. Seeing the actors grow up from kids to adolescents is interesting to watch and it's totally refreshing from all the boring stuff that have to be made quickly and sell good. Twelve years is not an easy project to do. A lot of things could have happen in those twelve years that would have ruined the idea of the movie. I thought all the actors did a great job. Nobody bugs me or anything. The movie might be long but to me it was necessary to bring the whole story. I liked it. To the people that say this was the biggest disappointment of the year I can only guess they don't watch a lot of movies.
BOYHOOD,5 February 2015,,"it is strange to define it as good movie. it is not strange to define it as boring. in fact, behind be good/bad/useful/boring/interesting , it is new genre of cinema. almost documentary, without expected ""bones "" of story, without great acting but fresh and impressive for the hard work, for the fresh image, for small details. I love it not for a special motif. not as image of childhood or Ellar Coltrane as revelation, not as admirer of Ethan Hawke of as fan of Richard Linklaker but as an open window. an experiment who gives new definition of film art in a special manner. nothing exotic. only a honest work. that is all."
BOYHOOD,6 October 2014,10/10,"'Boyhood', which was ambitiously shot intermittently over an eleven-year period from May 2002 to October 2013, to show the growth of young boy and his sister to adulthood, is An Experience...Not To Be Missed!Writer-Director Richard Linklater deserves an ovation for his sheer passion & masterful execution to this human-story. He narrates a tale of ""Boyhood"" with unbelievable conviction. You connect with its protagonist, Mason, because all of us, in some way or the other, went though what he did. And eventually, we all grew up & our childhood ended forever. 'Boyhood' celebrates the spirit of life & the circle of life, which we all are a part of. Linklater's Screenplay which spans a decade and a little more, is beautifully done. It explores so many themes, but most importantly, life itself. The Characters are real & so is their journey. The Dialogue are moralistic. And despite a running-time of over 165-minutes, 'Boyhood' doesn't lose momentum for even a single minute. Linklater's Direction is sensitive. He has handled the film masterfully & he, without a shed of doubt, deserves Oscar-Nods for his work as a Writer & Director, in here. His unfathomable passion & love, for Film & Art, cannot be snubbed! Lee Daniel & Shane Kelly's Cinematography captures the essence of the film, most admirably. Sandra Adair's Editing is simplistically done. Performance-Wise: Ellar Coltrane as Mason, gets into the character effortlessly & triumphs with a super act. We watch him grow mentally & physically. Patricia Arquette, as the mother, is terrific. Her emotional breakdown in the penultimate portions, stay with you. Lorelei Linklater, as the sister, who also transforms mentally & physically, is wonderful. But its Ethan Hawke, as the father, who steals the show. His portions stand out, thanks to his superlative portrayal. Others lend good support. On the whole, 'Boyhood' is not merely a film, its an experience. A Salute to Linklater & Team!"
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,,"""We're all just winging it."" Dad (Ethan Hawke)Boyhood is the shortest long movie I have seen in years and one of the best, if not the best of this year. As if director Richard Linklater were imitating life by having the film's length speed by, an experience not unknown to those of us who have traveled for an all too brief time through this fleeting maze called life. The film uses the same major actors for 12 years, chronicling the passage of Mason (played throughout the dozen years by Ellar Coltrane) from his childhood to the beginning of college. It's not just the uniqueness of the long-term casting that makes this an epic of life, a more mundane treatment than Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life; it's also the sweet cadence, never hurried, that includes no shocking conflicts, no weird surprises, and yet keeps the audience committed to characters and events as they assess the management of their own lives and families. Boyhood is epic in the sense of longevity and universality, not in the heroic sense because no one here approaches heroic status. But humanity they have in a most realistic way.As Mason is building his life, writer/director Linklater peppers the script with wisdom from plain people like his dad(Hawke), who at one point counsels him not to long for the buffers in bowling because life doesn't provide buffers. In the opening quote of this essay, Dad exclaims what the film is surely about: We try our best, but mostly don't have a plan, learning on the job.A sign in a classroom exclaims, ""You are responsible for your own actions."" Such a non-existential-seeming a film as Boyhood turns out to be a tome on how fortunate we are to get through this life with little training but ultimate responsibility.""I was somebody's daughter, and then I was somebody's f______ mother."" Mom (Patricia Arquette) reflects on the vicissitudes of trying to craft an individual life in the midst of the world's expectations for what we should do. Her choices of men have been flawed, and she is not as beautiful as she once was, but she keeps trudging on happy for life giving her children who are turning out well despite the men in their lives.After the not-quite three hours of unremarkable but fascinating episodes of kids growing up and adults aging, one conclusion is that there is no master plan because most of us are just winging it. One thing is for sure, Andrew Marvell's Renaissance observation remains true: ""But at my back I always hear/Time's winged chariot hurrying near."""
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,10/10,"Just watched Richard Linklater's film ""Boyhood"" a picture that was shot over 12 years, and it's done so great as the viewer sees the main character Mason(in a super performance from Ellar Coltrane) change and grow up over that period on screen as time changes things and people. It starts in Texas with young Mason(Coltrane)at the age of 5 and he's your typical little cute boy with an older sister and it's typical with the problems of life his mom and dad(Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke)are divorced. And thru the film it's a tale of journey and change as soon Mason's mom gets married and divorced again while becoming a teacher and even dad marries and becomes a father again and the change of address is common for Mason and his sister! During it all a young man discovers life is about pain, like and dislike with trips, family and birthdays as age and time changes it all. One finds out about life thru time, age, and change. Overall beautiful film one of time and coming of age while learning life, and discovery is so common with time and change."
BOYHOOD,29 November 2014,8/10,"This much hyped 12-YEARS-A-FILM distills a boy and his family's 12 years lifetime into a 2h45m feature film is Linklater's genuine brainchild which silckly blurs the line between documentary and theatrics, finally arrives after the sublime closure of his BEFORE trilogy (BEFORE MIDNIGHT 2013, 9/10), and it is a sure-fire pinnacle in his resilient career with a marked traction into the Oscar race as one of the front-runners. In the past 12 years, each year, Linklater assembles the same cast, the centre four are Mason (Coltrane), his divorced parents (Arquette and Hawke) and his elder sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), to shoot a string of shorts about their life, mainly Mason's as the title denotes, which Linklater has scripted before, and when Mason reaches 18, the film ends with his first day in college, signals a finish-line for his boyhood and augurs an unmapped future into adulthood. The most distinctive feature of Linklater's unconventional project is the sense of ""time"", which lapses without resorting to the usual tactics of captions, we sense time through the physiognomies of people, the trend-setting technology (cellphones, iPod, video games and laptops) and the pop hits of each year (the film literally opens with Coldplay's breakthrough hit YELLOW in the millennium) within these 12 years, it is another kind of vicarious catharsis for audience to experience, sometimes one may want the time stills since we are longing for more of the story at that period, but the dispassionate editing tenaciously cuts in and it is another year with another episode. Also, as Linklater's trademark, BOYHOOD is not surprisingly consisted of a profusion of dialogues, which is the main factor makes me dig into BEFORE trilogy, written with enlightening witticism but disguised as a perfectly spontaneous sincerity. But in here, Ellar Coltrane's Mason basically is an introvert child (perhaps a setting to in line with Coltrane's own character), who mostly is a passive observer than a keen communicator, even during the most intimate occasions (e.g. with his girlfriend), the conversations are mostly packed with normalcy and banality, there is a frustrating wanting of frisson here (compared with BEFORE trilogy) which deters a more devoted investment into Mason's world, nevertheless, we can feasibly find connections in his story (more or less), for parents, it will be more reflex to stir the right chord with the scenario. Also the episodic randomness is a double-edged sword, axiomatically it is a requisite process for such a lengthy project, but the almost equally divided year-to-year chapters in a way erase the possibility of audience-pandering crescendo one might expect, for instance, the drunken first step-father played by Marco Perella, his explosion and unreasonable rage is too cringe-worthy to watch. Still, I am not bad-mouthing this film's achievement, just nitpicking from my personal angle, I cannot conform to its landslide adulation, someone is destined to be not in the same wavelength with it anyway. Having said so, Hawke and Arquette register incredible aura here, Hawke is as loquacious as ever in Linklater's films, his father figure is mostly heartwarming, the children learn the most important lessons from him, although they mainly stay with their mother. The much-absented-from-big-screen Patrizia Arquette is more likely to win some recognition finally, her entire transformation is as memorable as Coltrane's, her own story in these years sound more interesting to me than his children's. Sight & Sound just announced BOYHOOD is their No.1 film of 2014, so now is ""the"" time for Linklater, and with its epic scale in time, the film is unique, groundbreaking, winsome and crowd-pleasing, what's more one can expect?"
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,10/10,"'BOYHOOD': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Richard Linklater's groundbreaking '12-year project film' about a boy coming of age, from the ages of 6 to 18. Linklater filmed the movie, with the same cast, from the summer of 2002 until October of 2013. He was given $200,000 a year (for a total $2.4 million budget) and assembled the cast a few weeks out of every filming year. He wrote the film over the same time period and allowed all of the the main actors to contribute. The movie stars Ellar Coltrane (who was 7 when the film began filming), Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke (a usual filming partner of Linklater's) and Lorelei Linklater (Richard's daughter). It's received near unanimous critical praise (with only 2 critics, out of 178, giving it negative reviews on Rottentomatoes.com) and it's now one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time! I think it lives up to all the hype.The story begins when Mason (Coltrane) is six-years-old and in the first grade. He lives with his single mother Olivia (Arquette) and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), in a small town in Texas, until Olivia moves them to Houston; so she can go back to school. Olivia marries her professor, Bill Welbrock (Marco Perella), who also has two kids, and the six start a new family together. Mason and Samantha's father, Mason Sr. (Hawke), comes to visit his children, on the weekends, after a year-and-a-half absence. When Bill becomes an alcoholic, and abusive, Olivia moves her two children again, to San Marcos, and they have to adjust to a new life there. The film continues to follow Mason and Samantha (especially Mason) as they deal with all the struggles of growing up and living with separated parents.The movie is a great examination of life and coming of age. The thing that really sets this film apart, from all the rest, is that the main actor in it (Ellar Coltrane) is going through all of the same things in his own life, as his character is (or at least experiences similar to them). That's what makes this movie so unique and true-to-life. One could argue that there's never been a more accurate and detailed depiction of what it's like growing up (for a young boy) but that's entirely subjective, and up to individual opinion (of course). I think those who don't (or wont) like this movie are mostly just those who can't relate to the central character. I don't think anyone can argue that it's not a well made film; the directing and writing are superb, the cast is all exceptional (especially Coltrane and Hawke) and the method of filming is definitely brilliant. The film is a one-of-a-kind viewing experience and undoubtedly a masterpiece of cinema! It deserves all of the praise it's been getting.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ZEmam3XwQxw"
BOYHOOD,4 February 2015,9/10,"More than any other filmmaker working today (with the possible exception of the ""Up"" documentaries' director, Michael Apted), Richard Linklater takes the long view of life. He certainly demonstrated that with his romantic trilogy, the ""Before"" series, which focused on the relationship of two lovers at widely variant periods in their lives. And now he's upped the ante again with ""Boyhood,"" redefining what it is that cinema can be and do.Any other director dealing with the theme of a boy becoming a man would have used flashbacks, makeup, and different but similar-looking actors to represent the lad at various stages of maturation and growth. Not Linklater. Instead, he chose to begin filming his opus in 2003 with a six-year-old actor named Ellar Coltrane and to return to the project at various intervals during a ten-year period, eventually putting it all together into a single two-hour-and-45-minute film called ""Boyhood."" The movie also features Linklater staple Ethan Hawke as Mason's dad, Mason Sr.; Patricia Arquette as Mason's mom, Olivia; and Lorelei Linklater (Richard's daughter) as Mason's older sister, Samantha.Spanning a full decade, the narrative flows seamlessly from one period to another - so seamlessly, in fact, that it often takes us a few moments to realize we've jumped ahead in time. Linklater often references key political/cultural touchstones of each era (i.e., presidential elections, music videos) to help orient us as to when the events are taking place and just how much time has passed. The risk of a high-concept movie such as ""Boyhood"" is that it will become all about the gimmick and little else. Luckily, Linklater has more in mind. Mason (along with his sister, Samantha) is the product of a broken home. Mason Sr. and Olivia are already divorced when the story begins, with Mason Sr. playing the role of ""weekend dad"" that has become so much a feature of modern family life. As the years pass and Mason transitions from childhood to adolescence, he has to cope with not one but two abusive step dads, a life of constant flux and instability due to constant moving, and all the rites of passage a young man must go through on the journey to adulthood: alcohol and drug use, first love, first sex, first breakup, etc. As a bright, observant kid, Mason prides himself on his free-thinking, nonconformist way of looking at the world. He indulges in moments of introspection, pondering his future and his place in the world and casting moral judgments on the generations that have come before him - with that combination of unearned cynicism and naïve optimism that belong uniquely to teenagers just starting out in life. The movie captures well the way in which young people are often at the mercy of adults. Mason is the recipient of a steady stream of lectures and words of advice from the adults in his life, some well- intentioned but some decidedly not. In fact, the movie makes clear that adults often take their own inadequacies and frustrations out on kids, who essentially are not equipped, either physically or psychically, to fight back and defend themselves. Conversely, the movie also shows, through Hawke's character, just how hard it is for a part-time dad to develop a deep enough relationship with his child to be able to impart crucial life lessons to him or her.For it should be emphasized that, despite the title, the adults are as crucial a part of the fabric of the story as are the kids. Single parenthood, a succession of failed marriages, creeping middle-age malaise - there are just some of the life experiences experienced by both Mason Sr. and Olivia as time passes and the story plays itself out.It should be noted that the concept Linklater has come up with has one inherent pitfall that he could, perhaps, not have fully predicted or appreciated when initially embarking on the project. And that is the issue of what happens if the child actors that you start out with aren't necessarily the best actors for the roles in the later stages of the story. And this is what appears to have happened here, for both Coltrane and Linklater are much better in the earlier stretches of the film than they are towards the end. This problem could have been avoided if the director had taken the more conventional route of hiring different actors all at one time. But it was important for the director to stay true to his vision, so the resultant weakness can be easily forgiven.What one is most struck by when watching ""Boyhood"" is just how much patience it must have taken for Linklater to be able to sit on all this footage for such a long time - with crossed fingers, no doubt, that nothing too untoward would happen to his performers in the meantime.There are sure to be a handful of naysayers who will argue that not enough ""happens"" in the film, that for a movie of such scope and ambition, it is notably lacking in ""major"" events and epic revelations. But that seems to be the whole point of Linklater's work (as it was in the ""Before"" series as well) - to provide as accurate a keen and unadorned observation of everyday life as any mere mortal could be expected to do, and to make the point that while we often measure our lives in terms of the ""big"" moments, it is really all the ""little"" moments that, when rolled together, truly define who we are. With ""Boyhood,"" he has more than succeeded in that endeavor."
BOYHOOD,16 August 2015,7/10,"Boyhood's notable for being a movie filmed over a period of years so it can watch a boy grow up not by using makeup or different actors but simply by using the aging process itself. While that sounds gimmicky, it's striking exactly how little it plays like a gimmick. There is no announcement when it moves from one year to the next; there's a scene, and then another scene in which his hair is different or he's a bit older looking. Each year, a few days of action were filmed centered around, for the most part, the beginning or ending of something or a special moment - a marriage, a divorce, a birthday, a graduation. There isn't a lot of story, or a lot of drama, and these are fairly ordinary people leading ordinary lives. And while I'm not a big fan of movies that can be described that way, I found this one generally engrossing. Of director Richard Linklatter's films, this is closer in spirit to his wandering, aimless movies like Before Sunset (which I hated) than to his more entertaining films like School of Rock, and yet, I did like it. I find the critical raves puzzling, but still, it's worth watching."
BOYHOOD,4 January 2018,7/10,"""Boyhood"" has been pending on my watch list for quite a long time, yet I resisted that movie. The word that came to mind whenever I was reading the summary and the praiseful comments was ""gimmick"". All these ""12 years in the making"", a boy's life spanning the time of the film's release (the opposite actually) and the whole philosophical contemplation about the daringness of the project left me cold. Retrospectively, I was wrong... but I'm glad I was, because I waited so long I could experience first one of the greatest movies of all time: Michael Apted's ""Up"" series.Not twelve years but five decades in the making, not one but fourteen persons, British men and women followed since the age of seven and with a glimpse on their lives every seven years, the last edition was 2012's ""56 Up"". I binge-watched the documentary for two weeks and it was almost a metaphysical experience, there was no plot and no character's arc, not pre-written anyway. It was just life itself with the usual share of twists, surprises, deaths, marriages, separations, strikes of luck, and people just growing, getting more or less optimistic or blasé, depending on their respective experiences, making the whole series more thrilling, riveting and inspirational than any fictional creation.I was surprised by how ludicrously lacking the name ""Apted"" the comments on ""Boyhood"" were, I don't know how much of an inspiration it was to Richard Linklater, maybe he didn't have ""Up"" in mind, but once you finish the documentary, ""Boyhood"" can only strike as a feeble attempt to duplicate ""Up"" from the perspective of a little boy (played by a natural Ellan Coltrane); his sister (Linklater's daughter Lorelei) and his divorced parents played by Rosanna Arquette and Ethan Hawke. So, in the process we also follow the evolution of two adults from their younger years of wandering and wondering to their term-coming forties.The film ends with a young boy who still hasn't figured yet what to do exactly with his life and seems to take it as it comes whereas the adults, especially the mother, question their accomplishments. This is a credit to the film's intelligence, it doesn't try to put an artificial narrative, it doesn't have a specific arc, it just consists on hazardously assembling the pieces of a puzzle whose big and final picture is the meaning of life. Needless to say that the only satisfying note the film ends with is that every player of this twelve-year slice of life hasn't ended in depression, drugs and other cliché situation. On that level, ""Boyhood"" hit the right chords.So I'll play the devil's advocate: one of the main criticisms the film received is that the story wouldn't have been one tenth as interesting on a classic format. True, but if you take one year to make a film, you'll be more likely to spice it up a bit with conventional twists. Linklater fulfilled the dream of a lifetime, making sure his players would be available whenever he needed them, it wasn't the safest bet, so he couldn't possibly make this film with a specific plot in mind, that would have undermined the whole edifice and deprived it from that air of fresh unpredictability. Besides, Linklater knows what the audience wants, to see little Mason evolving, as superficial as it is, it was the film's reason to exist.
And we see that little kid growing up, embracing life and its share of injustices and predicaments, authority figures with conflicting advice, an absent father and a mother moving from places to places. Mason and his sister didn't have the perfect life, they grew up without roots so that might explain why at the end they turn out to be so free-spirited. We don't know if it's an artistic take from Linklater but the way the format of the film and the story overlap and influence the experience reminds me of other movies where the form defines the content like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or Hitchcok's ""Rope"", not that the film plays in the same league though.
""Boyhood"" is good filmmaking and never really throws the concept to our faces which is good, to a certain extent. I suppose Linklater didn't want to punctuate his movies with ""two years later"" but sometimes, the lack of chronological indicators can be confusing and you can't really tell the change. The film seems to follow a flow as natural as life but the inclusion of some bits rather than others is questionable and make you wonder whether the real focus was ""boyhood"" or any part of life. Mason starts as an insecure kid, then a girl approaches him with a nice comment on his haircut, later, he's bullied and before you know it, he's got many girlfriends. Despite being the center of our attention, Mason is sometimes harder to reach than the meaning of life. And the same goes with other characters, first stepfather starts as a disciplined man and then he turns out to be an alcoholic, one is an Afghanistan veteran and then becomes your typical bigot, Patricia Arquette is your struggling mother and all of a sudden, becomes an Academic teacher, what for the next twelve years? President of the USA? I don't think that was the kind of underlying messages the film called for especially when the sister started as a pre(co)cious girl with a lot of potential but then turned into your average superficial teenager. I did enjoy though Ethan Hawke's parts, I think he was one of the best things about the film.In the ""Up"" series, each protagonist had twenty minutes of screen-time in each episode, so you can all compact their lives in a ""Boyhood"" runtime, the film had an interesting promise but overall, it's very uneven as if it was victim of its own device."
BOYHOOD,1 February 2020,8/10,"Film-makers trying to tell a story set over a long period of time suffer from the problem that their casts don't age at the same rate as their characters. Makeup (and latterly CGI) can go some way to correcting this, but when the characters are children, there's often little choice but to cast different actors. For his film 'Boyhood' director Richard Linklater took a different approach: film in pieces for more than a decade. The result is a film that feels very intimiate: I have no idea whether Linklater was guided in his script by his cast's real lives, but at any rate, we see them turning from children to adults and it's feels moving and close. The actual script is very gentle, centred on the sensitive (but not too unusual) Mason; the subtext is the reality of the struggles of parenthood. I don't always like Linklater, but I think he's at his best when, like in this film, he doesn't appear to be trying too hard; it's a lengthy movie where in some senses not much happens, but it never drags, perhaps because what does happen is simultaneously so ordinary and amazing."
BOYHOOD,23 August 2020,9/10,"Watching this wonderfully simply conceived slice of life recalls watching the British 'Up' series of documentaries that commenced in 1964 or Jean-Pierre Leaud growing older but not wiser as Antoine Doinel. It's ironic that early on 'Boyhood' should reference the first 'Harry Potter' film, since it's sequels were hurt by the actors outgrowing their parts too rapidly, while that was always part of director Richard Linklater's plan from the outset.Few are aware that when Linklater began shooting this so far unique endeavour in 2001, David Carradine had for nearly fifteen years already been making his life of Mata Hari (originally due to star Barbara Hershey but eventually embarked upon in 1977 with his then 15 year-old daughter Calista in the lead), still included on the IMDb as a project in progress!"
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,10/10,"Films have always been something that I look to in order to find solace in something I don't really understand or to just go to escape for a few hours. Boyhood not only moved me exponentially, but it brought me back through my childhood as I watched this boy grow up on screen in just a few hours. I have simply never seen anything like it. I was enthralled with this straightforward story that defines how complicated and difficult life can be while also helping to solve some of life's many unanswerable questions. I don't know that I have been moved more than I was while watching Boyhood.The performances are incredible across the board. Ethan Hawke reunites with Richard Linklater once again and gives an Oscar worthy performance. Patricia Arquette carries the film and brings the emotional gravitas that nearly brought me to tears by the end of the film. But props to the whole cast and crew for making a film over 12 years which is something that has never been done before and probably will never again. Each person holds their own and makes a story that shouldn't be seamless, feel absolutely fluid and authentic. I love that the film never acknowledges it's time change, it simply expects the audience to realize it. Perhaps the point of that being that we never really change, we just find out who we are and embody who we were always meant to be. The film is a cinematic achievement but the beauty of the film lies within its reality.Richard Linklater is one of the few genius filmmakers working today. He has a way of connecting to the audience that thought they were never reachable. His commentary on life is consistently the most fascinating thing that cinema offers and no other director has more to say than he does. Where his 'Before Trilogy' was about the unattainable but irresistible love and undeniable connection you may form with someone, Boyhood is about becoming a man but more a tribute to you being you. I can't remember a film that better represented what it meant to grow up as a boy and trying to figure out who you are as a person. Whether it's the music of Blink 182, going to baseball games, or the ever obnoxious junior high classmates, Boyhood recreated my childhood on screen. Ellar Coltrane (Mason) is the same age as me and seeing him grow up reminded me of all the ups and downs that came with becoming an adult. I didn't go through divorces, abuse, bullying, or anything as severe as Mason did. But I always struggled to come to grips with figuring out who I was. You see, it's not always the same exact events that occur in a characters life that we relate to, but the inner mental struggle of figuring out your future and how the people we surround ourselves with can change our lives for the better. From beginning to end I was captivated with what this film had to say about that. The credits rolled but I refused to take my eyes off the screen because I still wanted to stay connected to this extraordinary piece of art. I felt this rush of emotion that I haven't experienced in quite some time. It was like I had just visited my past to better understand who I am now and who I am meant to be. This is the ultimate coming of age film. Some films define segments of my life and will be remembered for particular events that occurred while watching the film or just correlated to who I was at that particular time. But Boyhood to me defines an entire childhood, and perhaps even a lifetime.+Ultimate coming of age film +Breathtaking story about capturing life+Cinematic history +Has so much to say about becoming yourself +I can relate to Mason 10/10"
BOYHOOD,12 August 2014,,"So initial reaction is disappointment. With that out of the way, this is a very fine film. Definitely a pretty good coming-of-age story. There's really not much here to discuss in terms of technical achievements because it's all pretty straight-froward and simple. Of course, not counting the obvious achievement at its core and following these actors over 12 years. I can't help but feel that maybe, just maybe, that's played a big part as to its critical reception. On the other hand though, maybe so, so many people really just connected with it on an incredibly strong emotional level and, well... I just didn't. Not to say that I didn't connect with it, because if that was the case I wouldn't have liked it. I just never felt that incredibly strong pull that, say, I felt with Linklater's Before films, that moment of awe and magic that it seems like everyone had with this. I always pretty much liked it, but never felt that larger amazement. As for the performances, Arquette is easily the best here. She really sells her part in the most realistic, grounded way (right before Hawke, who is also pretty great) and has some truly outstanding moments that let her deliver. The two younger stars don't bode as well. Ellar Coltrane, for the most part, does some nice work. Yes, he comes off sort of awkward, but that helps his character and his line deliveries seem to improve as he gets older. Still, his awkwardness also threatens to come off as unrealistic at times. Lorelei Linklater, though, really drags the part down. She seems nervous and totally uncomfortable with everything after the first act. Maybe we can buy it as a character? No, it just really took me out of some scenes. Overall, I really, really liked this. It's been two hours since I saw it, though, and I don't find it incredibly memorable. It's a disappointment only because of the super, duper high reviews/praise, and time will tell if I'll like it more (or less)"
BOYHOOD,6 September 2020,9/10,"Richard Linklater truly did something special and unique in filming this over 12 years. Watching Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater grow up over the 165 minute run time is a reminder of just how fast kids change, as trite as that sounds, and the film is quite touching. I don't think any of the vignettes we see hit a home run, but taken together as a whole the film does, in part because of its deep sense of authenticity. Linklater is masterful in his restraint, not turning this into a montage of big milestones or a melodrama, even though there are painful moments. Just one example of that is when the family moves when the kids are still young, and the last we see of a friend is a brief glimpse of him biking as the car drives off. It was natural to reflect on my own life and the lives of others while watching it, and the film seemed to showing me truths about life when viewed this way. What a lovely final scene too."
BOYHOOD,2 July 2015,10/10,"Boyhood will always be remembered as the film that took a realistic approach to making the movie, and that is filming the movie over the course of twelve years using the same actors. But this film is an American masterpiece that takes a look at the journey towards adulthood. Life is about success as much as it's about failure, and this film takes that earnest approach. We see the good side and the bad side of our main character, Mason as he grows up. It's really amazing how this film kept its continuity after 12 years of filming. But going beyond that, we get a traditional growing-up story that is full of realistic performances and excellent writing. Richard Linklater's passion project is about a boy named Mason and his experiences with life as a child and as a teenager. Along the way, he shares memories with his anxious mother, his rebellious father, his older sister, and other groups of people. This film is full of rich, authentic performances. Ellar Coltrane does a magnificent job as Mason. As time goes by, we see how deep his performance is. Ethan Hawke, which makes a film ten times better, does another great job as Mason Senior. His role here, and his philosophical views on life almost reminds me of his role in the Before Midnight series. Patricia Arquette does an amazing job as Mason's mother, who never seems to get a break. She goes on a mental breakdown more than once, and it's Arquette's performance that makes her role tremendous. Overall, Boyhood is a magnificent growing up tale aided by the new creative approach Linklater took in making this film. It shows that Linklater is pushing the envelope even further when it comes to telling stories. He took a risky approach, but it paid off in the end. This film will make you cry, but it will also make you happy. It's a story about life and how complicated life can be. One of the best films of 2014, and it's much better than I originally thought it was going to be. My Grade: A+"
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,,"Life inspires art. Art imitates life. But where it truly makes our heart sing is when they both meet at the intersection for it is in that moment when we get to experience the best of both. In a time when most films being released are either sequels, prequels, remakes or starting points of new franchises, there finally comes a picture which stands completely alone but nonetheless reaffirms the faith that the cinematic art form is all but lost.For its ambition alone, Richard Linklater's Boyhood deserves a special mention for what we have here is the quintessential coming-of-age story that captures the process of growing up unlike anything done, seen or experienced before in film history, is the closest cinema has ever come to replicating real life on film canvas & is amongst the greatest achievements of filmmaking which won't soon, if ever, find its equal.Boyhood tells the story of the younger members of a broken family & covers their journey from childhood to adulthood as they literally age in front of our eyes in the span of its limited runtime. However, the main focus is on Mason's life who's introduced to us as a six-year-old boy living with his single mother Olivia & older sister Samantha, and from then on it depicts one casual event from each year of his life until he's off to college.Written & directed by Richard Linklater, Boyhood presents the esteemed filmmaker at the very pinnacle of his already impressive career as what he manages to accomplish here is something most directors can only dream of. It's not only his most ambitious & unique film to date but is remarkable enough to deserve the tag of his magnum opus. The screenplay is an amalgamation of twelve different scripts, one for each year, which together form a cohesive whole.Cinematography makes minimal use of camera movements & nicely captures each sequence while Editing provides seamless transition from one segment to another throughout its 165 minutes of runtime. The film also makes exquisite use of pop-culture references in order to indicate the passage of time & even its soundtrack is filled with songs which are perfectly in tune with the timeline depicted, starting with Coldplay's ""Yellow"" & concluding with Arcade Fire's ""Deep Blue"".Coming to the acting department, Boyhood features an incredibly committed cast in Ethan Coltrane (Mason Evans Jr.), Patricia Arquette (Olivia Evans), Lorelei Linklater (Samantha Evans) & Ethan Hawke (Mason Evans Sr.) who all chip in with excellent performances in their given roles but what's even more amazing is the terrific chemistry they share with each other & just how convincing their characters look. And within each character, we can truly glimpse snippets of our own lives.To see each one of them literally age by so many years inside 3 hours of runtime, to witness the young cast's body & voice morph naturally as they pass through adolescence, and to know that the kids we're introduced to in the beginning & the young adults we meet near the end are the exact same people & not different actors, these things do end up leaving a profound feeling of its own which can't be put into words. And as far as the spirit of childhood is concerned, Boyhood nails it with stunning precision.Listening to stories before going to bed, constantly fighting with siblings only to make up in the next moment, frustration of getting an unwanted haircut, moving from one place to another, days spent playing video games, making new friends, losing touch with old ones, first serious crush, first heartbreak, countless lectures about life from grown-ups & turning hobbies into passion, it's in moments like these where Boyhood makes an indelible mark on its audience & makes them see in the film their very own portrait.On an overall scale, Boyhood is an exquisite ode to growing up which completely defies all conventions of filmmaking, is crafted with meticulous care n relentless dedication & has something in store for all its viewers. While some may complain about the lack of any definite plot as well as no sense of where it is headed, I see those elements to be a reflection of the unpredictability of life itself. Transcending almost every limitation of filmmaking to realize its larger than life ambitions, Richard Linklater's latest is a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
BOYHOOD,11 October 2018,8/10,"Boyhood is a fascinating experiment in filmmaking. Watching the actors grow up over the course of 12 years is a truly unique experience. I also like that the main characters are good people - they're not perfect, but they're trying to do their best. This movie is like watching someone's home movies, if their home movies were beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. This was a very ambitious film and I'm glad I saw it. I also look forward to seeing ""Boyhood 2: Manhood"" in another 12 years."
BOYHOOD,19 April 2015,8/10,"Boyhood is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast. It was a very ambitious project, taking twelve whole years to make, and you can tell that they changed the script multiple times in order to get with the times, which is very impressive and it clearly paid off in the end. However, the story didn't really take my breath away, though it was sweet and very real, I didn't feel much sympathy for Mason, which is hard because he is the main character of this three hour film, but as he got older he became irritating, and Ellar Coltrane's portrayal of him became significantly worse, with every actor he appears in a scene with stealing the spotlight from him. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are the highlight without a doubt, they held it together and are the main thing that made it so powerful, they are very believable as Mason's mother and father, they had many scenes and dialogue that reminded me of my own parents and I would have given this movie a seven if it wasn't for them. It has its flaws, but Boyhood is still a very impressive and groundbreaking film that all moviegoers must see. Follows the life of a young boy named Mason as we see him deal with many struggles from the ages of 7 to 19, such as school life, family and relationships. Best Performance: Ethan Hawke Worst Performance: Jamie Howard"
BOYHOOD,20 February 2015,8/10,"Boyhood (2014)Of course you have to like the big hook to this movie, just because it's so impressive and concrete. The same set of actors was used to film this in short pieces over the course of eleven years. So built into the whole screenplay (remember, this is fiction, and these are actors) is the idea of time, of amazing patience and consistency. As the boy, in particular, grows older, reaching college age by the final scenes, there is none of adjustments you go through with other movies that switch out actors. Furthermore, you realize this is one long thread and kind of say, wow.The movie also has terrific ambitions of the most modest kind—depicting a kind of average family, not too rich or too poor, not too successful and not overly dysfunctional. But a divorced family raising their child as they all grow, movie, change, adjust. It's quite moving at times, and if not quite insightful—it is what it is, and we know that already—it's still confirming in a thoughtful way.It isn't quite enough, oddly enough. There is a flat acceptance of this kind of reality, and a growing numbness to the ""ordinary life"" situations so obviously worked into the plot. There are not large dramatic twists exactly, so the plainness is meant to be the force of it. And it almost works out its miraculous intentions. But the idea, and the method, rise higher than the execution of it.Of the three leads—mom, dad, son—the son, played by Ellar Coltrane, is fabulous. He's a great guy—you get that whether or not he's acting. And he's so at ease with the camera you wonder exactly how lucky the filmmaker (Richard Linklater) got. I mean, when he was eight, who could say how he'd grow up, and how his personality would shift. Great stuff.The father is Ethan Hawke, and Linklater regular, and he's good. And the mother played by Patricia Arquette is also wonderfully complex and natural (though, weirdly, she pulls off this mom role week after week in ""The Medium""). The three of them— mostly two at a time—are the core of it all, and they hold it up through all the ordinariness.Those familiar with other Linklater films will notice some familiar tones of voice and even some dialog that could have been puled from other movies. This is especially disconcerting in the older Coltrane parts, because now and then he sounds like he's talking to Julie Delpy in ""Before Sunrise"" and the like. Maybe this is natural when a writer is writing from the heart—it happens in Woody Allen films, too—but when transparent realism is the goal, the lack of clear originality gets in the way.See this? Absolutely. With measured expectations."
BOYHOOD,20 August 2021,7/10,"I think it's a good movie, but a bit overrated. I think it was interesting to people because the movie was shot in 12 years."
BOYHOOD,23 November 2014,6/10,"""The moment is always right now."" Mason (Coltrane) was 5 when his parents got divorced. Splitting time between their father (Hawke) who is fun but not stable and his mother who marries bad man after bad man affects the way he matures. By the time he is ready to leave home at 18 his life has shaped who he is to become. This is a hard movie to review. The movie itself was OK but a little generic. The acting was good and it did keep me watching and even though the run time is nearly 3 hours it kept me interested for the most part. The best part about the movie is the ""gimmick that it used"". This is a movie that took 13 years to film because they picked the boy and the rest of the cast when he was 5 and rather than picking different actors for different ages the filmed a little bit each year. This means that the Mason at 5 is the same actor that plays Mason at 18. That really added a lot to the movie and made it feel much more real. Honestly though if it weren't for that the movie would be just another coming of age movie. Overall, one of the only movies with an in-your-face gimmick that works. Not a bad movie but the way they filmed it made it better. I give it a B."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,3/10,"A docudrama that is more an overly exaggerated contrived/artificial display of family dysfunction, probably written into the script to have something engaging, for what dragged on for an excessively long run time. Utilizes writer/director' daughter; a boy actor; and actors for about everyone else. Everyone is filmed as scripted for a few minutes every few years. I've seen more interesting and honest portrayals of how mundane our lives our on Youtube. Boyhood would have been more honest if random or even scheduled short clips from home video were extracted and then compiled. It also seemed to be written from the pov of an adult (which of course it was) and with that was the loss of the changing youth pov."
BOYHOOD,4 January 2015,9/10,"BoyhoodThe key to surviving boyhood is good medical coverage.However, this drama goes beyond the obligatory broken arm.2002 - Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) is 6-years-old when his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) leaves her then-boyfriend and moves him and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston, in order to attend University.2005 - Olivia marries her professor but his drinking ends the marriage.2008 - Mason takes an interest in girls, while his mom marries one of her students - an alcoholic Vet. 2013 - Mason must break-up with his girlfriend before heading to University.Periodically, Mason's unemployed - but amusing - dad (Ethan Hawke) shows up to take them bowling and offers an unbiased ear. Meticulously filmed over a 12-year period, director/writer Richard Linklater masterfully weaves an elaborate yet intimate and honest portrait of growing up.Incidentally, boyhood typically ends when you're kicked out of choir.

BOYHOOD,15 November 2014,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Boyhood"" (2014) is one of the best dramas i saw in 2014. It's scope is amazing, and when for the first time in movie history you can actually see characters getting older without make up of special effects, you can clearly feel this movies impact. The acting, script, story are all first rate, and although no one here will win Oscars (in acting department) in mine opinion they were all great. The story of this movie can not be summarized in one sentence, it's like a life itself can not be summarized quickly. For running time 2h 40 min. this movie ain't drag, it's superbly paced so if you like old school dramas about life, this one is a must watch.Overall, creators of ""Before"" trilogy invites you to one exceptional journey through of boys life. Kinda nothing groundbreaking new, but when you will see this movie, you will find out that it'a one helluva good motion picture."
BOYHOOD,28 October 2017,10/10,"I always complain on movies that last too long. It is extremely hard to make a movie longer than usual hour and a half or maybe two that will hold viewers attention at the same level till the end. 99% of 3 hours long movies become boring at one point, even if they are crowded with story, plot and action. And then movie shows up that has almost no plot at all and after 3 hours I find myself wondering why is it already over. Movie follows an ordinary life of an ordinary boy and his family from his early childhood till acceptance to college. If they continued till his natural death in old age I think I would still watch all 20 hours of it in single breath. Beside fact it is made in real time with same cast over 12 years and that Mason literally grows up in front of our eyes, I'm not sure what else makes this movie so special. But it is very special. And beautiful. ""It's three hours of fresh air.""10/10"
BOYHOOD,28 August 2014,8/10,"This movie made me felt like a parent after watching their children grow up in front of them. It makes me what to say, 'They grow up so fast'. This truly is a coming-of-age story coming from director Richard Linklater of the 'Before Sunset', trilogy fame. Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Richard Linklater went the other end. Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, 'Boyhood' is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. It's really amazing to watch for that alone. The movie felt like watching somebody else's home videos, one day, if they were made with the budget of Hollywood production values. I really deeply surprise, how the movie was even made. So many things could had gone really wrong with a set-up like this, like one of the cast members dying, loss of production value or film footage, or the film just being forgotten. Then there is the issue about it being illegal in the US to sign contracts lasting longer than 7 years, nobody could sign a contract for their 12 year commitment. I have to give mad props to the people making this film for that. Still, the movie isn't perfect, as there are some really major issues with the film. The movie pacing is really challenging to get through. It took me, a while to get through this film. The movie is nearly 3 hours long, with a lot of short scenes of pure nothingness. It's suffers from a thousand cuts. There were a lot of things that could be chop out of the film, because it doesn't lead anywhere. When, something does seem interested, they never go back on it, and explore it, even more. The movie just moves on. Half the time, you just guessing what you just saw, and left wondering how did, he get out of it. It was rushed. The movie lacks depth in certain areas because it covers way too many time in Mason's life, way too quick. There should had been little more exposition, like why Mason love photography? Where did this love, come from? What happen to him with the bullies? Why is his boss look like he has a man-crush on him? It's bothersome. Yes, you don't need to explain the whole movie, but there are really some huge gaps in time, that need a quick sum-up. Watching Boyhood visually is amazing, but the writing is up to question, because I really doubt, this movie had any sense of a plot or story structure. Indeed, it felt like they were making it up as they go. All the main events in this person's life are documented, however they really waste a lot of scenes talking about things that we don't even witness. I get that, some scenes are just there to tell us what year it is, using examples like books like Harry Potter and Twilight, and the discussion of politics. Still, its feels not needed. It's felt like a family discussion that went a little too long, and went all over the place. Yes, it makes the movie seem more realistic in tone, with the dialogue, but it also makes it, hard to find out, what's information, we, the audience should really take it, and what we shouldn't. It felt like a clip-show. Still, for the most part, the audience does get real personal connection with the characters. The acting for the most part, is pretty damn good. I have to say, mad props to both Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the divorce parents, Olivia and Mason Sr. Both have their charms and faults. The supporting adult cast is questionable as they weren't developed enough. I have to say, Marco Perella overacting as a drunk stepfather is more laughable, than chilling. It's probably the worst acting in the film. Some of the supporting children actors were pretty bad with their lines, but the main two child actors were so-so. I do think, Ellar Coltrane did pretty OK in the film. Still, it's a little more emotional would be good. It felt at times, that he was just reading it. The same with Lorelei Linklater as Samantha. She did had some really good one-liners, but she felt a bit too annoying at times. At times, the movie displays an impeccable sense of humor and fun moments like the kids meeting their stepmother's right wing parents. The nostalgia trip alone is worth the price of watching it. Great use of establish music. Still, the movie lacks music of its own. About the film being the first one to be film over time with the same cast. I can't recall another film being like this. I do remember, the documentary UP series with had the director revisits the same group of British-born adults after a 7 year wait. So if you like this movie, check that one as well. Despite the R rating, this is a movie that was made for everyone, of any age. Honestly, this movie should had been PG-13 as I do think Rated R rating was a bit harsh, but that's just my opinion. It's really up to the parent if they allow their child to watch this film. Overall: This movie is near cinematic perfection, and absolute must watch film. Just note to give yourself a lot of time."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,,"The most captivating thing about Richard Linklater's works is arguably the dialogue which alone carries the mesmerized audience through the entire length of a movie. As dialogues go, there is of course also Woody Allen, but the two masters' styles are quite different. Allen's elite upper middle class dialogue, often philosophical and erudite at the same time, goes down as an exquisite piece of artwork. Linklater's, we love, as being more down-to-earth and yet no less intellectually engaging. Allen's we admire at a distance; Linklater's we embrace with empathy. Most would also agree that Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy, while not entirely ground-breaking, is the best we have so far in this unique brand of cinema synchronizing the progression in years of the actors and the characters. One could quip that this puts the makeup people out of business, silly jest but certainly making a point. I have not read sufficient background material to know whether the idea of ""Before sunset"" was conceived right at the making of ""Before sunrise"". But it would be hard to convince anyone that during the making of ""Before sunset"" Linklater did not have at least a vague story board somewhere in the back of his mind for ""Before midnight"". Each, however, was a 9 year wait for the audience.When you watch ""Boyhood"" which traces the growing-up and coming-of-age of the protagonist over a 12 year period from age 6 to age 18, it is all too easy to overlook the immensity of the project, because it is such a seamless journey in the cozy cinema. You will not consciously register that what you are seeing has been shot over a period of 12 years, allowing you to witness the development of real-life Ellar Coltrane from 6 to 18, portraying our protagonist Mason. With him every step of the way is Lorelie Linklater, the auteur's very own daughter, playing Mason's older sister Samantha.All critics heaping praises over praises on this film agree that its unique beauty is in being so real. We are sharing the daily lives of people who could be our neighbors, our friends and, yes, ourselves. That is not to say that there is no story. No, you don't see Tom Cruise's desperate run with two kids to escape the pursuits of Martians (or whatever). At yet, what is happening to the people through this 165 minute journey we share with them have important impacts on their lives, at the moment or more lasting, or likely both. The couple had their kids before their mid-twenties and could not cope, eventually taking the realistic route of divorce. But the parenting continues. At the opening of the movie, she (Patricia Arquette) is struggling to make ends meet while he (Ethan Hawke) is just back from two-year drifting in Alaska. The kids love him, which he well deserves despite his shortcomings. Mother does not really hate him but simply cannot put up with his innate irresponsibility. He, for his part, explains honestly to the kids part of the reason why the relationship does not work ""as you know, you mother is a piece of work"". They know. Through the 12-year period crucial to the development of the kids, the mother, in her noble goal of giving the kids a better life, struggles to further her education and eventually succeeds in attaining the status and job she wants: teaching in university. The father, although technically no longer part of the family , is never really away. He actually fills in a gap of teaching the kids, in his endearing way and from his worldly wisdom, things they perhaps don't get from their mother, such as explaining to Samantha arriving at puberty the importance of condoms (she covers he face with her hand, giggling in total embarrassment). The mother remarries twice, first to another divorcée who also has a boy and a girl that become just like blood siblings to Mason and Samantha. But, as the man degenerates into a despicable drunk, they leave him. The second one is a marked improvement but eventually does not work out either. Later, the father remarries too, to a very nice woman and gives Mason and Samantha a cute little half-brother 15 years younger. The joys from watching this film is manifold, making it my choice of Best Picture for the year. Linklater's signature dialogues I have mentioned. While they do not carry the entire movie to the extent of the ""Before"" trilogy, the quality remains. Interesting to note that one particular scenario which was developed in ""Before midnight"" is put to best use here: dialogue between the car driver and the front passenger (we have some of the best between father and son here). Another divinely blissful scenario, and there are a few in the movie, is whenever a guitar appears, strumming languidly to people singing to enjoy themselves and the company around them. Best of all, the screen positively brightens up whenever Hawkes appears. He is just that adorable. ""Boyhood"" has 5 nominations for Golden Globe (picture, directing, screenplay, and acting for both Hawkes and Arquette, in the ""support"" category) which are exactly duplicated for BAFTA. I wouldn't be surprised to see at least another repeat for Oscar, if not more."
BOYHOOD,5 July 2018,8/10,"This film was so natural that I can't fault it in any way. Remarkably, the film was shot over a 12 year period, with the cast coming together for about 12 weeks every year for shooting. Therefore Mason is played by the same actor (Ellar Coltrane) through the entire span of the film, as well as the rest of the cast, off course, but I mention Mason here since he is the lead actor. This makes the film even more believable to see him grow throughout the film - from an innocent young boy to a typical teenager trying his first cigarette, having his first beer, thinking about girls, etc. Even the speech was very appropriate from kid to teenager to young adult. I must admit, I really enjoyed the movie's dialogue. Although the film is very long, I never found it boring. It was like watching someones (real) life play in front of me and it was interesting all the way. In fact, after almost 3 hours I was disappointed when the film ended - I wanted more.Although it is a film to savior, it is not the type of film I'd watch over and over, but having seen it I'm glad I did and will fondly remember it as a very good movie. A truly moving picture."
BOYHOOD,30 August 2020,8/10,"This film was a long time in the making and it is a long thing to watch, yet it completely pays off. We follow the actors across twelve years as they age from young children to young adults and all of their life experiences along the way. It is very impressive and very immersive as we really feel like we get to know these characters. It had a naturalistic feeling, like we were watching a real person's life. Although there is no overall plot to tie it together, it has overall themes that recur in every scene which have to be felt and not explained. My only complaints are that the ending dragged on a bit and the scene with the Mexican man was so cheesy it made me laugh out loud."
BOYHOOD,21 March 2015,8/10,"""Boyhood"" is a drama movie in which we watch the life of a boy from his early childhood to his arrival at college. The distance that we cover in order to fulfill this is twelve years and as the time goes by we observe many differences of course on the look of the boy and the rest of the cast but also some other difference according to his behavior, his reactions and his character.I really liked this movie because it was the first time that I watched such a kind of movie with that plot and that storyline. Of course twelve years are a lot and from this we can understand how difficult was the filming of this movie. Also the direction which made by Richard Linklater was very good. The interpretation that was the most enjoyable in this movie was Ellar Coltrane's who played as Mason and I found him very good at his part. Some other interpretations that I have to mention are Patricia Arquette's who played as Mason's mom, Ethan Hawke who played as Mason's dad and Lorelei Linklater's who played as Samantha, Mason's sister.Lastly I have to say that ""Boyhood"" is a really different movie than those that we are used to watch and that is something that makes this movie so unique. Many people think that is a waste of time and money but I do not believe that, it is a great movie to watch from which we can learn many things about the relationships between people, the importance of family and how our characters change through time."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2017,9/10,"Using the revolutionary approach of filming the same actors as they age along with the events of the movie, director Richard Linklater created a 100% unique, authentic film. While that technique could have been used as a ""gimmick"" and nothing more, Linklater is able to back it up with a simple, yet engaging, premise: the life of a child.For a basic plot summary, ""Boyhood"" focuses on the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane), a boy we see age from grade school years to college during the course of the film. Along the way, the movie focuses on the events that make a life, well, a life. Through family strife (and good times), many moves, and plenty of milestones, viewers are drawn into the life of Mason and how he both affects and is affected by those around him. Other key players in the experience are his sister (Lorelei Linklater), mother (Patricia Arquette), and father (Ethan Hawke).Obviously, ""Boyhood"" got a lot of publicity because of how they basically filmed it over a number of years in ""real time"", if you will, as the characters aged themselves. This gives the film a more authentic feel rather than using makeup or prosthetics to achieve aging. While not all movies are able to use this approach, obviously, it was a perfect choice to tell this type of story, where the journey is just as important as anything else in the picture.In terms of overall story/plot, this is the type of movie that I often struggle with, as it indeed lacks a central event to tell the story around. It literally is ""watching a boy grow up"". A lot of times, I think that could easily get meandering or outright boring, but Linklater manages to succeed because he makes everything feel so authentic. Using real-aged actors was only the first step, with the next being the ability to touch on certain mindsets and milestones in every young person's life. There were times during the viewing when I'd think to myself ""yeah, I remember thinking/doing that"" as a young person, and I think that most people who watch the film will have similar reactions.So, despite no ""hook"" (or at least a much more esoteric one than most films provide) in the traditional sense, ""Boyhood"" manages to succeed wildly because it does what it sets out to so perfectly. If you are intrigued by thinking/concept movies, this one is a must-see."
BOYHOOD,13 November 2014,8/10,"Boyhood is most certainly a unique and utterly ambitious piece of filmmaking by the ever interesting and increasingly good Richard Linklater, a movie 12 years in the making and an undertaking that so easily could've gone totally wrong. That Boyhood is the quality film it has ended up being is a testament to the skill Linklater possess behind the camera and the ability his actors in the form of Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke possess in front of camera but Boyhood isn't immune to lacklustre filmmaking and as much as it succeeds as a tale of growing up that runs near 3 hours in length, it also fails to engage completely as an affecting whole.Boyhood suffers at times from a lack of clear direction (perhaps this is the point I'm not entirely sure) and as our protagonist Ellar Coltrane as Mason grows up before our very eyes it becomes increasingly clear that as a character Mason is just not overly appealing and as an actor Coltrane fails to engage as the years draw on. Instead of developing into an actor, he regresses into a shell of a human and in doing so stops Boyhood from reaching outright classic status as a feature film and it's a shame Linklater couldn't of made Mason into a more appealing human being. There are real joys to be found early on in Boyhood and the intimate moments Linklater captures between Mason and his family are at times overwhelmingly affective and I'm sure that all who watch Boyhood will be able to relate to moments presented here, in that it will surely spike memories of our own childhood and that is where Boyhood comes into its own, despite Coltrane's limitations as an anchoring actor.With the uniqueness of its set up, Boyhood allows Linklater to create an ode to growing up in a way we've not really ever been privy to before in a movie made way. It's at first a strange and off putting experience as a viewer, but before long you feel like nothing more than a fly on the wall to Mason's journey of becoming an adult and the moments within his life that shape who he is to become. While Arquette's struggling mother no doubt shapes Mason's life the most, it is Hawke that becomes that standout character of Boyhood with his long time growing up father and his interactions with Mason both as a young child and later on as a teenager inspiring the most emotion in Boyhood's un-driven narrative.A lovingly crafted film with beautiful work in all facets by Linklater and a feature in a world of its own, it would be hard to not enjoy Boyhood but equally as hard to wholly love for many viewers as not everyone here or everything that happens is actually all that enjoyable and the story could've done with more engaging elements. A staggering achievement to keep on track for the years it took to film and a great ode to the transformation of our early life, Boyhood is a must see movie, just don't expect to witness that downright classic many have unjustly labelled it to be.4 alcoholic partners out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
BOYHOOD,7 September 2014,7/10,"Boyhood (2014/I) was written and directed by Richard Linklater. The movie's concept is interesting--film a boy's story over 12 years, using the same actors. (It's fiction--not a documentary.)Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane) and his sister Samantha (played by Lorelei Linklater) begin the movie as young child actors, and mature into young adulthood. Luckily, both of them can really act, or the whole project would have fallen flat. The adult actors are all highly competent--Patricia Arquette is Mason's and Samantha's mother, and Ethan Hawke is their biological father. Marco Perella, as their stepfather, is very, very scary.Although the concept is clever, the movie really didn't work that well for me. The problem for me is that the story isn't all that riveting. Mason is supposed to be a highly talented photographer, but we never really see his photographs. He's not highly verbal, and he's not a bad kid, but, to me, he's not all that likable. Of course, he's faced with his mother's repeated bad choices, so maybe his character is doing the best he can under the circumstances. This is a long, long movie--165 minutes--and it would be better if shorter. What amazes me is that, as I write this review, the movie is carrying an unbelievable IMDb rating of 8.8! If it maintains that rating, it will be considered among the top 50 highest-rated movies of all time. It's pretty good, but it's not that good. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. There are some outdoor scenes that will work better on the large screen, but my suggestion would be to see it on DVD. That way, you can stop it after 1 1/2 hours, take a break, and then go back to it when you're ready for more."
BOYHOOD,12 July 2017,8/10,"Director and writer Richard Linklater went where no director has gone before, and he aced it! The patience it takes, let alone the long term commitment to keep pounding away on a project that lasted so many years is simply astounding. This film is a little gem of a story, and all the actors were very easy to fall in love with. Sure the story is slow paced for my liking, but knowing how (long) this was filmed, more than made up for the pace. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me"
BOYHOOD,1 February 2015,4/10,"Review: I know that this movie got high reviews, which is why I was really looking forward to watch it, but I personally found it pretty boring. The whole pace of the film was slow and after watching watching 2 kids and there mum growing up over 12 years, it really didn't seem like anything major happened all the way through this 2 and a half hour movie. I was hoping that there was going to be a twist or some form of an incident which would change the tone of the film, but nothing really happens. Your basically watching 2 kids adapting to there mothers failed relationships, whilst keeping a grounded relationship with there dad. There are a couple of emotional scenes but I can't really see why the critics raved about this film. Don't get me wrong, it is well written and the actors do play there parts well and I did feel for the mum who had to bring up her children under extreme circumstances but when the movie had finished, I couldn't remember a scene which I found outstanding. Anyway, it's worth a watch if your into your deep dramas and don't mind watching normal family values for over 2 hours, but I personally lost interest after a while. Average!Round-Up: This movie really made a serious profit at the box office and with 6 nominations at this year's Oscars, the audiences must have really loved watching this family grow over 12 years. I liked the whole flow of the movie because it really doesn't seem like so many years have passed. The only problem is that none of the characters go through a major incident like most families do. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who play the loving parents, played there parts extremely well and they made the movie seem realistic and emotional, along with the kids who adapted to ever tricky situation well, but I drifted off after a while. Maybe if I watched it again, in a different mood, I might enjoy it more.Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $44millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas which is based on a dysfunctional family, over 12 years, with the kids adapting to there mothers boyfriends whilst growing up and making new friends. 4/10"
BOYHOOD,9 April 2015,7/10,"Stet, a troubled and angry Texas boy of eleven lives on the less affluent side of the tracks in Boychoir, Quebecois director François Girard's (""The Red Violin"") feel-good story about a musically talented boy's climb from adversity to self-acceptance. Written by Ben Ripley (""Source Code""), Girard's first film in seven years boasts an outstanding cast that includes Dustin Hoffman (""Chef"") as Anton Carvelle, choirmaster at the prestigious Boychoir National Academy, Kathy Bates (""Tammy"") as Justine, the school's feisty headmistress, and newcomer Garrett Wareing as Stet, a young student with loads of talent and plenty of attitude.In constant trouble at school, Stet returns home each day to clean up after his alcoholic mother and perform household duties normally handled by adults. Nurtured for his precocious singing talent by the principal at Stet's school in Odessa, Texas, Ms. Steel (Debra Winger, ""Lola Versus""), the boy is granted a private audition with Master Carvelle (Hoffman) through her efforts but, not knowing who he is, Stet abruptly walks out. When a family tragedy strikes, Steel finds Stet's absent father (Josh Lucas, ""The Mend"") and persuades him to reject foster care and apply for the boy's admission to the Boychoir in New York, a nationally recognized singing group with its own boarding school.Stet, however, is rejected because of his attitude and lack of discipline, that is, until his father, relieved to keep the knowledge of his secret son from his wife and children, smooths the way with a large undisclosed ""contribution. Unsurprisingly, the boy has trouble adjusting to his new situation, getting into fights with his over-privileged classmates, breaking windows, raiding the candy machine, and being generally withdrawn and uncooperative. His extraordinary singing ability is recognized, however, by both Wooly (Kevin McHale), an academy teacher who has faith in Stet and Drake (Eddie Izzard, ""Castles in the Sky""), the assistant choirmaster who is impatiently waiting for Carvelle to retire.Unable at first to read music, Stet is tutored by a fellow student and nurtured by Carvelle, a strict but compassionate disciplinarian whose own ambition for a career as a concert pianist was ended abruptly by a rejecting teacher. In a moving scene that takes place on a basketball court, Carvelle uses ""ruthless compassion"" to tell Stet, ""All you need to do is quit since it is obvious that music means nothing to you."" But Stet, with a new-found determination, refuses to quit. However, when a nasty confrontation arises with Devon (Joe West), another talented singer who insists on getting all the solos, Seth has to do all he can to survive a disciplinary hearing and prepare for a concert in New York, one that may be the most important in the school's history and in his own life. It is a concert in which all parents are invited.Boychoir has a story that keeps us engaged but, if the film is remembered for anything, it will be for its music. Angelic is the best way to describe the American Boychoir's performance of choral works such as Tallis' Spem in Alium, the Balulalow from Britten's Ceremony of Carols, Handel's Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne and Hallelujah chorus from The Messiah, and especially the exquisite Pie Jesu from Gabriel Fauré's Requiem, a chance for Stet to demonstrate his unique talents as a soloist. While the potential is present for a great film and the film's conclusion is extremely moving, its potential is unrealized mostly because of its headlong rush to keep the plot moving and stir the emotions at the expense of credibility, freshness and originality, and character development.Excellent performances by the always reliable Hoffman and Bates keep the film afloat, but the dialogue, when delivered by other than Hoffman or Bates, feels strained and wooden and the film never reaches the heights of inspiration it strives for. Eventually, Stet must confront the reality that his voice is changing and that his time as a boy soprano is limited. When he asks his young teacher what the point of all the music lessons is when a singer's time in the choir is so limited, the answer goes beyond music to reflect on the impermanence of all living things, a fundamental truth of our existence. It is the film's most authentic moment."
BOYHOOD,9 December 2019,6/10,"The journey of adolescence is one personality-altering experience that each of us inevitably undertakes. An existential life step that physically and personably transforms our very bodies, from innocent child to independent adult. Parents forced to release their protective talons and enable their children to venture out into the harsh world, justifiably falling down the pitfalls of life and picking themselves back up again. But what's the point of it all? We grow up. We attend school. We work. We live, love and lie. Only to see ourselves never progress on a personal level. Life is valuable. It is a finite amount of time that rapidly ticks by at the rate to which we grow older. It can often be disillusioning, but most importantly, it can be special. It's up to us to make the most out of the limited time bestowed upon us.Linklater's sprawling coming-of-age epic is a technical masterclass in ingenuity. Depicting the adolescence of a young boy growing up in Texas with his divorced parents. Logistically, literarily and lovingly, Linklater opted for the innovative concept of filming in real-time. The actors physically growing with their characters, with the ability to add personal experiences to the narrative. This ambitious depiction of maturing is subconsciously organic, and proved to be an effective method in illustrating adolescence. It kept the casting limited, without having to obtain multiples actors for the same character at different stages of childhood, and exhumed a sense of natural intuition.That being said, this meticulous construct of film-making unfortunately facilitated a mellow story that lacked any drama or emotional depth. Coming-of-age dramas work effectively when depicting one specific year that dares to dramatically endeavour into relatability. The issue with Boyhood is that, due to its extensive duration of narrational time, several aspects were emotionally subdued. For example, Mason experimenting with alcohol and recreational substances. Linklater failed to dig into the emotional conflict that lead Mason down that path, merely likening the character to an empty shell. Another example, Bill drunkenly assaulting Olivia. Again, this case of domestic abuse is only touched upon before Linklater moves on with Mason's life.Boyhood is essentially a montage of fictitious memories. Good and bad. It's all part of growing up. But does that necessarily result in an entertaining or emotionally captivating film? For me, it's a hesitant ""no"". Sure, there will be scenes that are relatable to your own upbringing and therefore engage you momentarily. Personally I warmed to the scenes involving Hawke's fatherly figure and his attempt to rekindle with his children. Growing up with divorced parents, Linklater's dialogue was incredibly realistic and related to my own life. But as I said, he then quickly moves on with the narrative and the emotionality is diminished yet again. Hawke and Arquette offer their intense acting styles to spice up the narrative, however Coltrane and Linklater's own daughter rarely displayed variety. The plot's structure itself commenced with nostalgic-fuelled simplicity (GameBoy Advance SP, DragonBall Z, Coldplay's ""Yellow"" etc.) and then ending on philosophical existentialism, which I suppose merged adequately with Mason's advancing frame of mind.Yet I cannot shake the feeling of disappointment. Linklater took no risks with the story. Limited emotional depth. Boyhood, for all its technical ingenuity, remained hollow. ""One of the greatest films of the decade""? I'm not convinced, yet I appreciate the innovation behind the lacklustre story."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2020,6/10,"BOYHOOD (2014) :
Brief Review -An incomplete tour of unstable adolescent of an ordinary American boy. When i came to know that Boyhood was a filmed in 'real time' for 12 years, i was impressed and shocked. I started expecting very matured and intellectual stuff already but now i can say that actually the film couldn't surpass or even came close to those expectations. Looking at the title i really thought Boyhood is just about the boy but it is not and may be too much focuse on his family members somewhere spoiled the essence of the film. In 160 minutes the boy should have had the longest screentime but he hardly had just little more than the other characters. It's more a story of an unstable family which the boy is part of rather than just the boy therefore i guess the title should have been different. The makers begun shooting this life tour of Mason (from early childhood to his arrival at college) without a complete script and that's where everything went wrong. Despite 12 years long journey it still feels an incomplete film because it doesn't have complete ending, neither it shows any outscome even after so many odds and unstable theories. I didn't like the script at all but somehow the narrative was engaging and watchable because of storytelling by the director and performances of all the actors. Boyhood is fantastic but only if you belong to such unstable and immoral American culture where not a single character is committee to any thing in life, doesn't have any aim or Focus to look at the life in positive way and doesn't learn from mistakes. For rest of the audience it is just another good film which can be watched once and can be kicked out from memory quickly. Well, i belong to the latter category as i expect something intelligent from a film rather than typical family drama and useless ruined lives. Overall, a decent one and strictly good film with several conditions.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest"
BOYHOOD,7 October 2015,9/10,"BOYHOOD is one of those films that inevitably divides critical and audience opinion. The narrative meanders throughout the 165-minute running time with little discernible purpose other than to chart the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from childhood to personhood, about to quit home for the delights of studying at the University of Texas at Austin. There are few climatic moments; and occasionally it seems as if director Richard Linklater has lost all desire to tell a story as he focuses instead on the relationships between his protagonists.Yet this is precisely what he has sought out to do. He wants to recount the life of a slightly dysfunctional family - divorced parents and their two children, Mason and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) - through Mason's perspective. As a child, Mason doesn't view life in terms of an ordered plot; he is more preoccupied with immediate impressions (playing with his close friends in the street, trying to keep his parents happy) and how they affect his view of the world. There are some sequences strongly reminiscent of DEATH OF A SALESMAN in the way they show the children interacting with their father (Ethan Hawke) as he takes them away for a weekend dedicated to false jollity. It's important to maintain a facade of happiness, even if the family lead unhappy lives. Sadly this illusion is brought down to earth as Dad and Mum (Patricia Arquette) are shown fighting with one another in the garden; through an upstairs window Mason and Samantha watch them silently, as they become aware of how fragile their family life actually is.Both of them learn how to cultivate self-protective strategies. For Samantha this consists of developing an aggressive exterior; by contrast Mason tends to retreat into himself. Silence is often the best policy, especially when the children have to content with their mother's aggressive second husband, Professor Bill Wellbrock (Marco Perella), an outwardly urbane, civilized university teacher who is transformed into a violent alcoholic at home.What BOYHOOD demonstrates above all is the way in which adults - not just Mason's family, but his teachers, relatives, even his employer - are prepared to offer him advice, whether he wants it or not. It seems that they believe that children and adolescents should be made in their own image, rather than developing in their own way. Mostly Mason learns how to accept such advice with a nod and a smile; but as he grows up, so he acquires self-determination. In one climactic episode he tells Mum's third husband to lay off and give him (Mason) some space.Eventually Mason learns the possibilities of creating that space for himself, as he acquires a truck of his own and learns how to drive along the lonely Texan roads. We see several shots of him driving throughout mountainous landscapes, that are mostly deserted except for the mountains in the background. The road extends as far as the eye can see into the distance. Symbolically speaking, this represents Mason's future as he begins to follow the road of life in which what lies ahead is still unknown.BOYHOOD is a wonderful film that contrasts the vast expanses of the landscape with the furniture-filled interiors of bourgeois life; the sets make a direct reference to the obstacles the children have to negotiate in the process of growing up. Beautifully shot and directed by a genius, it deserves to be recognized as a modern classic."
BOYHOOD,18 August 2014,10/10,"Calling ""Boyhood"" ""unlike anything you've ever seen"" is stating the obvious, yet there is almost no other way to describe it in as many words. Making a film over the course of 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater has transformed everything we know about filmmaking, in some ways challenging the very definition of ""film."" It sounds simple: tell the story of a boy growing up in close to real time by filming him every year of his life instead of having him play a younger version of himself or casting another actor in the role. But ""Boyhood"" accomplishes so much more than the mere use of an edgy approach to storytelling. It turns out that watching a character grow up on screen has a radical effect on how we perceive the character, how we relate to him and how we connect to him. It's a completely different experience for the viewer.As such, Ellar Coltrane has the coolest keepsake/chronicle of his childhood anyone could ever ask for as the star of this movie. He plays Mason, ages 5 through 18, who along with his big sister (Lorelei Linklater, Richard's daughter) lives in Texas with his mom (Patricia Arquette) and occasionally visits with his dad (Ethan Hawke). The film chronicles his growing pains and formative experiences, from trouble with his stepfathers to life transitions to adventures with his dad.""Boyhood"" is easily the closest that fiction has ever come to cinema verite. It often feels similar to watching a documentary. Linklater tells the story in chronological order, unlocking the true potential of his film in doing so because jumping back and forth would have given off the appearance of significantly more editorial control, damaging the powerful realism of the project.What makes ""Boyhood"" more than just a really successful filmmaking ""gimmick,"" however, is the power of its nostalgia and the universality of Mason's experience. Linklater didn't just pick a random kid and film his life; he crafted this story. The film's realism, the fact that it reflects pieces of our own life experiences back at us, is not a byproduct of this storytelling technique, but by Linklater's own design. Not just any director could've undertaken this project and achieved the same poignant result. His filmmaking experience (""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Before Sunrise"" and its sequels, and ""Bernie"") shows he has a real knack for playing with time and realism in his films.This in mind, Linklater's prowess as an editor really shines in ""Boyhood."" When you endeavor to make a film over the course of 12 years, you can't possibly know what you will need in the final every last piece of footage has been collected. Making sure at the time of filming that he had the right amount of footage to choose from later on and being able to tell one story from disjointed periods of filming takes the keenest of skill.A lot of the brilliance of the film is how past and future Richard Linklater work together. Past Linklater, the man behind the camera each of those years, understood the value of capturing footage that would put a distinctive time stamp on each year of filming. Future Linklater, the editor piecing the entire film together, used the powers of hindsight to sort through this footage and include scenes or bits of dialogue that add powerful nostalgia to the movie.For example, a short, wordless scene shows younger Mason, Samantha and their step-siblings at the midnight book release of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" in July 2005. Linklater soaks up the entire ambiance of this moment, which has nothing to do with the plot, and then however many years later, edits it into the movie in such a way that the millions who felt connected to those books when they were first released feel an instant, deep connection to it watching the film. He captured a collective cultural memory as it was happening and weaved it into the greater story of one child's life, not unlike the way we experience these moments in our own life. They happen once and they become memories. Similarly, Hawke's character is very politically outspoken, so we get treated to his thoughts at the end of the Bush presidency and the beginning of Obama's, reminding us of public sentiment during these years.The fascination with watching years of our lives in the form of Mason's play out in just hours is the film's hook, which allows the story flexibility to be more true-to-life. As moviegoers, we are conditioned to wait for the other shoe to drop, the scene of heightened melodramatic tension – there's almost none of it. The ratio of actual drama in our own lives to actual drama that happens in this film is virtually the same. Hawke's character, for example, isn't the deadbeat dad stereotype who comes back to cause problems for Mason and his family. He's more complex and less predictable. There's no full-circle effect in this movie or plot twist of thematic significance, just a straight linear story of how things change (or don't) with time with a few meaningful reflections at the end.Most films need those plot devices to be interesting. ""Boyhood"" doesn't. That's what makes it so unique, like dictionary definition of unique a.k.a. purely in a category of its own. Filmmakers could imitate this concept, but they probably would struggle to reach the same degree of authenticity, to have both the foresight and the hindsight, the ability to plan ahead and be flexible, to make a cohesive product. So Linklater didn't just make a cool film, ground-breaking film; he has transcended the very notion of what filmmaking can be.~Steven C Thanks for reading!"
BOYHOOD,23 November 2014,8/10,"""The life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18."" That's the summary of this movie on this site, and in its shortness it couldn't be more accurate. This is a single life, seen through the lens of a camera, nothing less. This is very much a life seen, or perhaps actually remembered, through snippets and key moments. Young Mason's victories and defeats are shown, and it all feels so real, without forgetting the everyday life.Boyhood will go down in history as one of the groundbreakers. It's a film of unforeseen scope and ambition, and it manages to pull of its grand plan without a hitch. To get all these actors to come back year after year, to be able to pick the perfect boy actor to grow up along the film, to change and polish the film to reflect the evolving society and culture, to show the passage of time. I am impressed beyond believe.And it's a good story to boot. It shows us why even an ordinary life can be interesting if examined through central moments. And sure, if you met a guy like Mason and heard his life story, you'd admit he has lived through some interesting times, but it wouldn't seem extraordinary. Especially when the most ordinary things in the movie are the ones with the most weight. The graduation party had me blinking my eyes because it felt so familiar, reaching the essence of that particular life event.I will remember Boyhood. Not any singular moment certainly, but I will remember Mason as a person. Fun guy. A bit cocky, like most teenager, and a touch arrogant, like most talented kids are. But ultimately worth knowing."
BOYHOOD,1 August 2014,6/10,"The esteemed director, Richard Linklater, has created one of the most ambitious projects in cinematic history. 'Boyhood' was shot over a 12 year period every year, focusing on 6 year old Mason (Ellar Coltrane) through his 18th birthday. Linklater deserves the highest accolades for perseverance and seeing his project through to the end. That said, despite the absolute fascinating conceit of watching a 6 year old growing up before your eyes, 'Boyhood' wouldn't be much without the attendant story Mr. Linklater has created over the years. According to the principals involved in the project, including the aforementioned Mr. Coltrane as well as Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, they never worked from a script with dialogue. Linklater simply provided them with the broad outline of the way he wanted the scene to move forward and they proceeded from there. 'Boyhood' is very much done in a cinema-verité style with a quasi-documentary feel to it. This 'slice of life' approach to storytelling inherently has its major strengths and weakness. On the plus side, there's the real conviction that one is watching a heady verisimilitude—that certain scenes are so reflective of 'real life', that such a reflective quality dazzles the viewer to the point of catharsis. On the other hand, other scenes, which also truly reflect real life, are simply too mundane to be engaging.Mr. Linklater (aside from one telling scene with one of the stepfathers) eschewed creating big, taut, scenes fraught with dramatic tension or suspense. Instead, he's gone on record that he purposely kept things 'low-key' to mirror ordinary life. As a result, it does take a while before things pick up with the 'Boyhood' story. When we're first introduced to Mason's Mom, Olivia (Arquette), she's having problems with her current boyfriend (a babysitter fails to show up and the boyfriend is annoyed that she's unable to keep a date with him). The family moves to Houston to be closer to Olivia's mom and then we're introduced to Mason's biological father, Mason Sr. (Hawke) who Olivia also argues with after she accuses him of not ensuring the kids had a good meal for dinner and had begun their homework. Hawke is particularly good in these early scenes as the ne'er-do-well father who can't seem to keep a job or be around much to see the kids.Ironically, one of the most gripping, dramatic parts of 'Boyhood' is Olivia's eventual marriage to her college professor, Bill, who turns out to be an abusive alcoholic. The scene in which he cruelly orders Mason to get a crew cut is indicative of this stepfather's destructive, controlling nature. Perhaps the most memorable and suspenseful scene in the film is when Bill breaks the glasses in front of the children and Olivia gathers up her own kids and then leaves the abusive loser for good. The next sequence (which is a mixed bag) includes Olivia's meeting and eventual marriage to Jim, an Afghanistan and Iraqi war veteran. Mason, now a teenager, shows up stoned at his surprise birthday party and Mason Sr. has now matured, remarried with a new baby. I particularly enjoyed the father giving Mason his Beatles 'mix-tape' but found the visit to Mason Sr.'s in-laws (Bible belt gun lovers) not dramatically engaging (note Linklater introduces the kids becoming acquainted with guns but purposely avoided any tragic goings-on, as part of his overall plan to keep things, 'routine'). Maybe that was good but the Bible belt revelations don't add a great deal to the overall narrative.Also rather perfunctory, is Jim getting drunk and having a heated exchange with Mason. It's true to life, especially when Olivia leaves him, but nothing particularly original (again Linklater is caught between a rock and a hard place, attempting to keep things mundane but true-to-life vs. going out on a limb with something maybe a little out of the ordinary).As things proceed to the climax, there are no extraordinary dark moments of the second Act. Instead, we treated to a sequence of scenes that are somewhat interesting but nothing very gripping: Mason caught in bed with his girlfriend by his sister's roommate; Mason's breakup with his girlfriend; Mason placing second in a photography contest and winning some scholarship money; family members toasting him at a graduation party and Mason Sr. giving his son some heartfelt advice about women.Many people probably were enamored with all these low-key, 'slice of life' scenes but I felt like I was watching a fairly typical American family documentary than compelling drama. Linklater serves up a few more predictable events including Olivia breaking down over the kids leaving and the final scene where Mason joins his new college roommate, his girlfriend and her roommate, for an 'encounter' with hash brownies in the desert.'Boyhood' probably has garnered the accolades that it has through Linklater's masterful use of of dialogue to highlight various thoughtful meditations on life. There is a rather intense scene where Mason's photography mentor gives him a long lecture in a dark room about not being mediocre and going all out in pursuit of one's dreams. There is also something nostalgic about a good part of 'Boyhood'—for example, when Mason is seen attending the 'Harry Potter' party as a child, it brings back memories for both younger and adult viewers. Ultimately I believe Mr. Linklater will be remembered for the sheer ambitiousness of his project. Fortunately, the principal actors who got involved, loved the idea from the get go and committed to working on it for 12 long years. I can't go so far and proclaim it a masterpiece as many others have done—since not all the moments in the film are worthy of being labeled 'high drama'; and some of it, is simply plain ordinary. Furthermore, some judicious editing may have improved the pacing of the film a bit more. Nonetheless, 'Boyhood' is a remarkable achievement due to the breadth and scope of the entire project."
BOYHOOD,20 February 2015,7/10,"""Boyhood' has a really unique feel to it as you watch. The concept of filming it over 12 years with the same cast is a truly brilliant one and something that would take an immense amount of patience on everyone's part. It could potentially be a logistical nightmare as well. You'd never know if the children you cast would grow up to be good actors, whether a cast member would pass away or simply refuse to return to the project (we all know actors can be slightly temperamental) or countless other issues that could arise over the course of 12 years. It's a brave and bold project but unfortunately I think that's all it is and the result isn't as great of a film as people are making out.Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke have both been nominated for Acamedy Awards in Supporting Roles for their performance here. I've said it over and over again that the Best Supporting Actress category this year is incredibly weak and there's no better evidence of this than the fact that Arquette is all but guaranteed to win. Her performance is adequate and nothing more. Someone rightly pointed out that had she not been forced to go 12 years without having plastic surgery for this film there's no way she'd be winning that award. That isn't to say she's bad in the role, she's just simply nothing special. I defy people to watch all the actresses nominated in this category and then to watch Sarah Snook in 'Predestination' (also starring Ethan Hawke) and tell me that's not a far superior performance. Hawke was the better of the two for me but his nomination as well seems to be riding on the coattails of the films success more than anything. He's a fine actor who always makes every scene he's in very watchable, that's about the extent of what he achieves here though. I would have liked to have seen the script give him an extra scene or two where he could really show his acting chops, unfortunately though his character never really faces much adversity and is just sort of ""there"" throughout.Before seeing this I kept thinking to myself that with an idea this bold and unique if they have managed to come up with a brilliant script to back it up then this film is going to be unstoppable and go down as one of the greatest of all time. Sadly I don't think they managed to achieve that. For a film that's close to 3 hours, not a lot happens. You have the cliché abusive marriage and parents being parents but absolutely nothing game changing. I suspect they were going for the ""realistic as possible"" approach, but to me it just comes across as lazy. Why would anyone want to see the story of a child's boyhood which was completely unspectacular when 99% of people experience that first hand anyway?All this negativity aside however, it isn't a bad film. There's the odd thought provoking quote and it is very well edited. 'The Theory of Everything' was far and away the best film nominated for Best Picture this year, but the win will go to 'Birdman' which was also a very fine film. As more and more people see this they'll realise it isn't worth all the hype it's received. Not a bad film, just not a masterpiece either."
BOYHOOD,13 March 2015,7/10,"Today, finally I got the opportunity to finalize my Boyhood watch. It was not easy - because of length. And what did I follow? Maturation of a boy, a rather introvert one, coming from a middle-class family, a rather widespread one at present - single mother and 2 children. He grew, without major mischiefs and achievements, going through the stages thousands of his coevals do in the Western world. A linear story, accordingly. Of course, its shooting over 12 years with same places and same cast provided a sort of uniqueness - no records broken, though.Well, I was not bored, although virtually nothing-happening can be more fascinating (e.g. The Station Agent), but as the cast was strong and versatile, then I focused on them most of the time. And still do not understand was Patricia Arquette has obtained more praise and awards than Ethan Hawke? They are both equally great there, but Hawke has more lines and minutes on screen. Younger performers were somewhat weaker, Lorelei Linklater, for example, did not impress me much. And more than 2.5 hours is too long for such a movie. Really. Luckily, I did not go to the cinema was seeing this, it would have been hard."
BOYHOOD,13 December 2014,10/10,"Writer-Director Richard Linklater is no doubt one filmmaker who has not received the spotlight he deserves in the hood of Hollywood. He has directed such wondrous films as ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"", ""Before Midnight"", ""School of Rock"", ""Dazed & Confused"", and much more. However, this mid 40's boy is about to get the attention he deserves for his marvelous work in writing & directing the coming-of-age flick ""Boyhood"". And when I say coming-of-age, I really mean it. ""Boyhood"" took 12 years to film. It captures the life of the young protagonist Mason Jr., from the time he is 5 years old all the way to he is 17. It was filmed in bits and pieces in a 12 year span. Linklater formulates a viable authenticity in the life of a child to teenager; family life, insecurity, identification, stability, discovery, etc. Mason Jr. is a child of divorce, and Linklater develops Mason Jr. not so much as a victim of an unstable family life, but a young survivor who still maintains his noble dignity throughout life's experiences. Ellar Coltrane's astounding performance as Mason Jr. from child to teen is of Oscar caliber. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette also delivered excellent work as Mason's divorce parents Mason Sr. and Olivia. Linklater's real-life daughter Lorelei Linklater shows that the Linklater talent is being passed on quite splendidly with her solid performance as Mason Jr.'s sister Samantha. This is no child's play, ""Boyhood"" is one of the best movies of 2014. ***** Excellent"
BOYHOOD,24 August 2014,10/10,"""You don't want the bumpers, life doesn't give you bumpers.""Anyone who has read my reviews in the past will know that I have a soft spot for coming of age films, and Boyhood has just become one of my favorite films in this genre. I haven't seen any other film that captures life as authentically as Richard Linklater's Boyhood does as we literally see these characters grow up right before our eyes during the course of 12 years. You know how we're always saying that life goes by so fast and that it only felt like yesterday we were graduating from school? Well Boyhood is an excellent example of this, as we see the journey of this 6 year old boy as he begins school and we follow him for 12 years until he graduates from High School. Linklater filmed short scenes with the same actors during the course of 12 years and later edited them together to create this masterpiece which consists of well developed characters and a powerful narrative that is beautifully paced. You never really feel its two and a half hours because the narrative captures you from the very opening scene. It is a unique experience for the audience because we get to witness the passage of time for this family and become attached to them. It genuinely captures the moments in the life of this family as the mother struggles to raise her two children on her own while she goes through a couple of unsuccessful marriages leaving marks on her and her children, but it does so in such a way that it never hits a false note and always feels authentic and true to life. It could easily have entered into familiar territory, but it never does because the film avoids clichés and relies heavily on Richard Linklater's brilliant script (which deserves at least an Academy Award nomination). Boyhood is one of those rare unique films that inspires and reminds you to enjoy every moment of life. It's an experimental movie that will be difficult to match due to the monumental effort it took to direct a film like this for more than a decade, but it really pays off and becomes a rewarding experience. A film that captures the essence of life as well as this only comes in extremely rare occasions so this is one you won't want to miss. We will hear a lot about Boyhood during Award season. Richard Linklater has made another splash in film history adding to an already rich legacy after his experimental work with the romantic Before trilogy. Teaming up with Ethan Hawke once again, Linklater allows us to witness another cinematic achievement, although the true star of this film is newcomer Ellar Coltrane who grows as an actor right before our eyes and shines on screen. The soundtrack also plays a key role in this film and Linklater knows a thing or two about music. The way in which he incorporated it during each stage of life was moving and only added to the underlying message Linklater was getting across of art imitating life. We see this through Coltrane's performance as he grows up, falls in and out of love, feels joy and despair, while friends come and go in and out of his life. While we visually experience how quick times passes through the physical changes in the children, it is in a late scene where Patricia Arquette is having a conversation with her son that we truly understand the emotional impact that the passage of time takes on us and how these moments sometimes become just a blink. Linklater's dedication for this film really pays off and it is such a rewarding experience for the viewer. This is my first 5 star review for a 2014 film and it will be very hard for another film to equal this experience. Richard Linklater has directed several great films, but I think Boyhood is his best and most complete film because it reaches out and touches audiences everywhere. It is a universal film with universal themes. It is the purest example of art imitating life. It reminds us to stop for a moment and remember that life isn't just about getting to our destination, but more about enjoying the journey and living the moment. Boyhood is an exceptional and groundbreaking film, a must see, and a modern classic."
BOYHOOD,12 February 2020,9/10,Great movie worth the hype and the 12 year wait. Richard Linklater deserved the Oscar
BOYHOOD,25 October 2021,8/10,"This is not the greatest film of all time, or even in the top 100, but it is still an exceptional film. The unique 12 year filming idea by Linklater is brilliant, and the situations facing the protagonist are just so real and emotionally involving, that you have to love the film. As a father of a ten year old, I am already facing several of the situations posed in this film, and, no doubt, will be facing several others portrayed in the film in the future. The moment captures us; we don't capture the moment is a profound observation of the director. Life is like a ship at sea in a storm; maybe you will survive, or maybe you won't, but you will have quite a ride. A film not to be missed."
BOYHOOD,4 December 2019,8/10,"After finishing Boyhood and slowly gathering my thoughts on it I did what I usually do, fly over to Letterboxd to jot those thoughts down before they escape me. What I wasn't prepared for was what happened when I saw that poster. It was a slap in the face, a jarring reminder that I had just spent twelve years with someone.I think it's easy to not look beyond this film's ambitious conception and even write it off as a non-eventful gimmick. There is no real plot, there are no grand character arcs, no dramatic tension. It lacks a narrative flow and has more scope than focus, it ambles on throughout its running time, meandering along the trivial and occasionally touching upon more serious matters, if only to skip on to the next minor life event most of us have experienced one way or another. If you'd regard these things as criticisms, you'd be right, Boyhood was probably not for you.It was for me though. Ever so much.Linklater's stunning film blurs the lines of art and life completely. In doing so, he brilliantly chooses an approach lacking of any pretense, opting for emulation instead of manipulation. I am convinced that many viewers, myself included, have this preconceived notion of how a dramatic film should play out and how it should be acted. Linklater wipes that preconception off the table with a project that is truer than anything I've ever seen. The acting is understated throughout which only adds to the realization of the ambition of the project. There are no frills, just life. Plain, ordinary life. And I did not expect it to pack such a punch.As a parent, witnessing a child's shaping of a past for an unknown future was a truly gripping experience. I felt constantly involved. It reminded me both of my youth and of my struggles and fears as a parent. Life isn't about the big moments alone, it's predominantly about the small moments, the fleeting moments that you'd want to hold on to forever in retrospect or regret experiencing or causing. Young Mason not knowing where he belongs, the constant look of regret in Ethan Hawke's eyes when he sees every missed opportunity looking at his kids, Patricia Arquette's relatable but ever so painful final monologue, that kiss, that camping trip, the Black Album, the shared fear for the drunk parent, that first beer, getting advice from your old man about your love life and leaving your parents behind to build a life of your own; Boyhood treats all those moments with a disarming tenderness, truthfulness and with the greatest of respect.This unique singularity in the world of cinema made me miss my dad, who died when I was six, ever so much, made me check on my kids to watch them sleep for a while and steered me towards some old photo albums. And looking at a younger me, playing my own version of Boyhood in my head, I fully felt the extent of Mason's last line in the film.The moment is always right now."
BOYHOOD,10 February 2018,6/10,"Unique and ambitious idea to film a movie with the same cast over 12 years but this was slow at times especially in the 2nd half. I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing ever did. Just the story of a boy named Mason from the age of 7 to when he goes to college. He deals with his parents divorce, adjusts to new stepfamilies and explores his own identity. No antagonists except a couple of drunk, abusive step dads. Ethan Hawke & Patricia Arquette do a great job as flawed but realistic parents.A clever flowing narrative of life though. No dates or times or given to show the passage of time you just figure it out by changes and aging faces. Ultimately I came away from this underwhelmed especially after all the hype. I think I was meant to feel nostalgic but mostly meh."
BOYHOOD,1 May 2020,3/10,"This movie is a technical achievement. It took many years to film this film. We can see the characters age, we can see the popular culture of the time in the background. Sadly that's about it. The story is very poor, it is the life, the ""boyhood"" of a boy, it shows how he grows, what happens in his life. He lives a very average life, so nothing is interesting or anything memorable is shown."
BOYHOOD,16 August 2020,8/10,"Interesting concept as it was filmed over 12 years. A lot of it is instantly relatable. The movie works not by showing us something new, but by showing something that most of us have in common. The movie is also interesting as it shows the evolution of the culture between 2002 and 2013."
BOYHOOD,7 December 2014,8/10,"""Boyhood"" is about Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his life as a 6 year old kid to an 18 years old college freshman. He has a sassy elder sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater). We meet his mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and her string of unfortunate choices in men, and how they affected the kids. We see his occasional meetings over the years with their estranged dad Mason Sr.(Ethan Hawke) and his aimless life, until he remarried and had a new baby.There are no really big events, no really big climax. This film is just an unfolding of a boy's life through primary school, middle school and high school, and the various random things that happened to him and his family in those twelve years. We hear a lot of pop culture references as the timeline goes through the years, from Harry Potter to Twilight. We see Mason go through bullying, marijuana, alcohol, first love, sex, his passion for photography, among others.It was Patricia Arquette who gets the prime acting moments in this film as the mom who goes literally through the wringer to bring up her two kids. Her final declaration before Mason went off to college is literally what all parents want to say at that time of their own lives. Ethan Hawke acts so naturally here as the happy-go-lucky father, as he always does.Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater literally grow up 12 years in front of our very eyes within the 165 minute running time. Their acting was so natural as willful kids, though they became rather self-conscious as they grew up. My favorite moment with Coltrane is the episode when Mason was 10, about that radical haircut his stepfather had him take against his will. After that, Coltrane's Mason became more reserved and reticent.I'm sure we all would have wanted more unique or memorable events to happen to Mason in this film, but that did not happen. Admit it or not, for most of us, life can really be a simple humdrum existence. Every so often we celebrate victories or mourn our losses, as Mason and his parents did in this film. But these are all considered minor in the bigger scheme of things, and we move on with our lives. ""Boyhood"" is as real a depiction of human life as it can possibly be. The story of our lives does not always have a distinct plot or a plot twist, but we go on living just the same.Richard Linklater is best known for writing and directing his ""Before Sunrise"" trilogy. That love story of Jesse and Celine was told in three films released nine years apart per film. Here in ""Boyhood"", Linklater tells a story that spans twelve years. This time, he actually took twelve years to film it (intermittently, of course). With that conceit, ""Boyhood"" is a literally epic piece of filmmaking in that sense, despite its episodic nature. Do not be surprised to see this film land in the list of Oscar Best Picture nominees for this year. It is bound to be there. 8/10."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,6/10,"""Boyhood"" is an interesting experiment, fusing the growth of the members of a ""typical"" broken family with a script that tries a little hard to sound special. Linkater has done it again and has shown his talent as a decent writer/director, and once again he has not self-monitored himself and gone a little too far and too long.The characters are fairly likable and realistic. Ethan's father shows his flaws and vulnerabilities, but he has the most adventurous spirit of the bunch, making us wonder what the children's potential would have been had he been able to stick around and work the marvelous Rosanna Arquette playing a struggling single parent who has rotten luck choosing partners and an ultra positive spirit no matter what happens. Then there are the children: a brooding and introvert boy and a girl who begins as a little opinionated chatterbox, yet turns sullen and quiet by the end of the film.The film begins a bit slowly and with the tone of a documentary. The introduction of the main people here is a bit boring because all we see is a quiet boy who is constantly harassed by his older sister, a lonely mother and his errant husband. Things don't look good, and we hope we are not going to be treated to a series of boring tragedies. Mom meets a new husband, starts working for her lifelong dream, has the perfect honeymoon in a glamorous European capital, and her children blend in perfectly with the new partner's boy and girl.However, what would it be life without a little drama? Soon, we have mom on the run with her kids, struggling again to make things work. Here we start getting some realistic reactions from the teenage girl who resents the instability in her life and shows her selfishness quite clearly. In the meantime, the young man just watches everything that happens around him. This might mean to be a reflection of his character, but I started getting antsy here because the dynamics are not quite there. Years pass by, and there is quite a bit of change in personalities. The young boy remains a bit melancholic and is more of a reactive personality. We keep seeing the world through his eyes. Not until he goes on a camping trip with his father, we begin to hear and see who he is. Because of the length of the film, this doesn't come in too late, but I would have liked to know what was going on in this boy's head much earlier.The second half of the film gets more in depth into what is going on as children grow and personalities develop. Mason pursues his dream of being an artist, begins to be a more interactive member of society as he meets girls and explores what being a teenager is. We see his friends, his teachers, his relationships with mom, mom's friends, and his father's new family. This is where the movie rings true. Unfortunately, we lose track of Samantha, and we know they're not close, until it's very convenient for plot development, when he visits her campus dorm. It appears as if Linkater switched gears and lost track of his story development.In fact, he gives more time to the males in his film as Ethan's part is expanded a bit to show how he has changed and found some peace with a new wife and family. There is a chilling moment showing us a bible and a shotgun in the same scene. Domestic violence sort of rears its ugly head again and disappears mysteriously. These are wasted moments with the character of mom. Samantha remains less than a secondary character here.In the final scenes of the film, we see more growth in Mason's character and wonder if we will have the opportunity to see another film exploring the future of this family's life. It is certainly set up with a wonderful scene between Arquette and Mason. Ethan's father is also open to further exploration because of the fact that of all of the characters is the most interesting and best developed. We know he's in constant change, and his new family provides plenty of opportunity for more dramatic opportunities.Overall, the film is by no means a failure, but it is a long way from the sensational creation many people appear to believe it is. There are beautiful moments full of emotion and sincerity, but we still have too many verbose scenes that take away from that reality that should be a constant. I know this is ""Terms of Endearment"" or a documentary on the lives of real people, but a happy medium would have been more effective. Once again, people should be more careful with their editing resources, be able to look back and cut those moments that don't add much to the product. I'm sure there are many scenes that didn't make, but now we can only wonder."
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,8/10,"I am usually not a big fan of ""documentary style"" movies, which are an excuse for sloppy scriptwriting, poor editing and bad photography. Following the life of a boy from primary school until college may easily have fallen into the category, but it has none of the above problems.The main character is Mason Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) literally ""growing up in public"". Arquette plays mom Olivia and Hawke is dad Mason Sr. Annoying Lorelei Linklater (the director's daughter) plays sister Sam. The script moves swiftly through some important moments in Mason Jr.'s life from age 6. Dad is often absent and has problems accepting ""real"" life, such as a normal job which would not fulfill his dream of becoming a famous musician. Mom tries to improve family life and fails, marrying an abusive drunkard professor.Mason Jr. is relocated a couple of times, losing his childhood friends and going through the difficulties of adolescence, compounded by mom's divorce, new job and new boyfriend. However, the best part of the movie for me was the normalcy of the situations. No super-drama, just ordinary life with the usual disappointments and small traumas (bullying at school, first love, etc) Luckily we are spared Mason Jr.'s first sexual experience and explanations about what is going on in his head. We observe him and may be reminded of episodes from our own childhood, such as why our parents made us play the ""game of silence"". Anybody can find a familiar episode, which will probably remind us that there is just a limited number of ""first"" experiences in our life.Coltrane is fine as the young introverted boy, but I started to dislike him as a gloomy adolescent. I am not sure which part of it was acting. The scene with Mason Jr. and his girlfriend walking around Austin a whole night might have been an ideal link with the ""Before"" series, unfortunately Coltrane does not have much of the charisma and acting skills of Hawke.Finally, the first 2/3 of the movie move smoothly, but the story gets stuck towards the end, just when morose teenage Mason Jr. gets most screen time. Contrary to the ""Before"" series, I am definitely not interested in a follow-up."
BOYHOOD,5 February 2015,7/10,"""You don't like me much, do you Mason? That's okay, neither do I.""As a concept movie, ""Boyhood"" definitely can be called a successful experiment. It took Richard Linklater no less than 12 years to realize this film. It's a registration of the daily life of an average American family with characters interpreted by the same actors or actresses in different life cycles. Is this an unique concept ? Unfortunately not. In 2001, the Harry Potter saga started with the main characters growing up while the story progressed. So that gimmick is already used.I'm also the proud owner of a whole collection of home videos I made for years with my Sony Handycam. Would the result be similar to ""Boyhood"" if I'd edit these nostalgic film clips into a motion picture ? No of course not, because my creation wouldn't be right. The synchronization between the different periods would be wrong. The themes wouldn't be in harmony. The continuity wouldn't be guaranteed, especially regarding the overall atmosphere. In terms of content, there might be similarities, but ultimately it simply will become a banal family documentary, dominated by triviality and platitude. What I'm trying to say is that probably there will be some who'll portray ""Boyhood"" as an extra-long home video, while for me it's not so evident to come to this result. Ingenious and phenomenal at the same time.Don't expect truly earth shaking events or developments. You only witness the calmly on-going life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane). A life like most of us have experienced it. A life full of ups and downs, with its euphoric moments and sad moments. A life that forms you as a human being into the personality you'll finally be when reaching adulthood. Also Mason goes through all these stages : first a carefree teenager, school troubles, domestic problems, puberty, an exceptional father who occasionally crosses (during major and minor moments) his life, teenage love, his heart being broken and than the final step to adulthood. 12 Years interwoven with no visible indication in what time span it's happening at that time and this summarized in 165 minutes. Together with his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), daughter of Richard Linklater and a teenager with an attitude, and his mother (Patricia Arquette), who won a gold medal in the Olympic discipline ""choosing the wrong guys"", a touching coming-of-age story unfolds itself. Afterwards you realize how volatile time is and how our life goes on with an irreversible pace.Ellar Coltrane plays literally and figuratively the role of his life. The beginning was a little bit sluggish and lethargic. It seemed to leave him indifferent which made him act quite apathetic. But as he grows older, I appreciated his deep philosophical musings more and more. His argumentation while driving on the highway about humanity functioning in modern society as self-healing and reproducing robots, because the manufacturing of cyborgs would be too costly, I found funny but at the same time I realized that it was uncannily accurate and that there's actually a little truth in what he claims. Again something I could identify myself with. Lorelei Linklater grows into a rebellious and wayward teenager. Arquette's roundings expand as the years pass. The only one whose looks remain timeless, is that of Ethan Hawke. Although it feels as if he plays an ancillary character who pops up occasionally into the life of Mason, I found this the most beautiful role in ""Boyhood"" and for me the one who exerts the most influence on the development of the person Mason. A brilliant interpretation: serene, vulnerable and supportive. And maybe it's my imagination, but I thought Mason resembled more and more Hawke as he grows older. What a coincidence.The final conclusion is that it's a brilliant concept with delightful characters who grow and unfold themselves as time progresses. So what's wrong with it than ? Absolutely nothing, except in the end it's just a dull affair. You can't say there are many startling things happening. Despite the chaotic periods Mason's mother is going through , you can't detect any real traumatic experiences. Every average family's life looks like this. And yet this film is praised to the skies. And that's because everyone sees something in it they can relate to and finally think something like ""Hey, I also experienced it like that"" or ""Damn that happened to me also in that period"". And that's the strength of ""Boyhood"". A mirror is held up in front of you and you'll come to one conclusion : Life is a concatenation of moments you need to enjoy fully, because there comes a time you'll realize that those moments have passed. And that's perfectly summarized by Mason's final sentence: ""It's the constant moments, it's just ... it's like always right now"". More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"
BOYHOOD,1 September 2014,8/10,"Trigger Warning(s): Domestic Abuse & HomophobiaIt's hard to ignore a film which is getting universal praise and is probably the first, or one of the few, to use the same actors across various time periods of a character's life in order to tell a story. And for that, the film deserves a lot of props. Yet, the question remains: Is the gimmick all this film has to offer, or does watching a family over a decade really justify the universal acclaim and accolades this likely will get?Characters & StoryThe central character of Boyhood is Mason, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) who we watch grow up from the early 2000s, till maybe sometimes around 2012 or 2013. Throughout our journey with him we watch as his annoying older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) grows up with him; his mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) goes from one bad relationship to the next, while improving herself by going to school and getting a good job as a professor; and we see how his relationship with his father, Mason, Sr. (Ethan Hawke), who sees him a few times a month, affects him. Making for an overall movie which is very much like a sitcom in which divorce is possible, domestic abuse, Texan culture is featured, and honestly it feels like mostly the best parts are kept, with only the slightest bit of filler, to create a nearly 3 hour movie.PraiseOutside of the fact this film took 12 years to make, and used the same actors all throughout, much less surely set a standard I doubt many will repeat/ invest in, honestly it is sort of hard to praise this film. But, even with that said, I must say both Arquette and Hawke are a god send for the film. If just because those two help provide the film with just enough of a story for it to function. For example, if this was a normal movie, Arquette would be the star and everyone else would be supporting characters. For in her performance we get some type of foundation by watching her be a, mostly, single mom trying to better herself and provide her kids a family. Then, as for Hawke, he helps Mason Jr. develop as a character and help compensate for some of the issues of the film listed below. CriticismWhen it comes to the film, there are a lot of issues which lead me to not understand all the praise I see. If just because the film's gimmick of covering 12 some odd years becomes more a liability than an asset. Like when it comes to having a sense of time in the film, outside of a reference to Barack Obama's first presidential run, the other references used in the film may lead you to not know what year it is, and without that it is hard to know how far in time the film has leaped. Something which can be an issue if you want to know how old the children are, what grade they are in, and really follow along.Thus leading to major issue no. 2: over the course of the film, as much as you see Samantha and Mason Jr., it is hard to connect with them. The reason I think for this is because they aren't given much of a story at all. They, basically, for most of the film are Olivia's children who make life a bit challenging for her. Which, as mentioned in the praise, makes you feel she shouldn't be splitting the focus with the kids. However, being that the gimmick of film is a family through 12 years, unfortunately Arquette is but a piece of the puzzle. And while Hawke's character tries to help make Mason Jr. interesting, at the end of the day the kids are written with as much depth as most kids or teens are in regular films/ TV Series. Take Samantha for example, as the film goes on the only thing that changes is she whines less. I mean, yeah she talks about boys, gets a boyfriend, talks about drinking, and little things like that, but she doesn't at all present herself as someone worth taking an interest in. Nothing bad happens to her, she doesn't come off as someone you can relate to, and honestly sometimes I think she is in the film just because her dad is the writer/ director. As for Mason Jr., he is given slight depth, but with the film not focusing on one period of time, it makes every little detail of his life which could, and perhaps should, be explored over before we it can get to be developed. Then comes the major issue, for the whole cast, which deals with the fact that those 4 are the only consistent cast members. Everyone else comes and goes so frequently, and without saying or doing something of significance often, that after a while it seems pointless to learn anyone's name. Which perhaps is the film's real Achilles heel. For as much as Olivia's husbands matter when it comes to the story, after their part is done they seem more like footnotes than a character who had a major part in the story. Overall: TV ViewingRecognizing how cool the film's gimmick is, honestly when it comes to story it falters under the weight of said gimmick. The casts doesn't develop as you sometimes think they should, and with no strong supporting roles, the story overall feels like a super cut of a TV series in which significant moments and characters are included, but none of the meat of the overall story. Thus leading to a TV Viewing label for even with the film being nearly 3 hours, what is most praise worthy is the fact everyone stuck with this film for 12 years than the film itself."
BOYHOOD,18 July 2014,,"Three of my favourite films are ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Before Sunset"" (2004) and ""Before Midnight"" (2013), all written and directed by Richard Linklater, all featuring the same two characters growing up over time, all starring Ethan Hawke as one of those characters, all using naturalistic dialogue as the main narrative device to tell very domestic stories. So I was never going to need any persuading to see ""Boyhood"", written and directed by Linklater, centred on Mason growing up from five to 18, again starring Hawke, and again using dialogue rather than action to tell the stories and overwhelmingly set in a variety of homes.What makes ""Boyhood"" different from the other three movies, indeed what makes it astonishing, is that this 12 year story was shot in twelve chronological segments over a mere 39 days with the same core actors but it is presented as one integrated whole over two and three quarter hours. There is no overt signalling of the year to year jumps with the viewer left to join up the chapters which proves remarkably easy and even fluid. The commitment of all concerned is simply breathtaking.The eponymous Texan boy is Mason played by Ellar Coltrane who proves to be a remarkably subdued and laconic teenager, unremarkable in many ways and yet strangely attractive. His mom is Patricia Arquette who is terrific as a strong woman who nevertheless makes some bad choices, starting and finishing as a single parent. Hawke is the birth father who drops in and out of his children's lives with often a greater boyish sense of fun than his offspring. And Manson's sister is portrayed by the director own daughter Lorelie Linklater.This is not a film that one can judge by conventional storytelling standards. There is no real beginning, middle and end. We come in at a somewhat arbitrary point, we hang out with the characters for more than a decade of growth and development, and we drop out at a fairly random point (Mason is about to start college but has reached no real decisions about who he is and what he is going to do). As his mother laments towards the end: ""I just thought there would be more."" This feels less like a feature film, therefore, than a real-life documentary. It is that good."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2014,9/10,"This film is highly recommended.Richard Linklater has always been an edgy experimental director. And while his visionary approach of filmmaking has been erratic for my personal tastes, his work is well worth a visit. His overuse of improvisatory conversation among his actors in his Before trilogy, and his sojourn into many genres from animation (Waking Life), comedies (School of Rock, Bernie), biographies (Me and Orson Welles), and coming of age tales (Dazed and Confused) have had a profound effect on his art and have earned him many accolades.Now comes yet another slice of life story, one that took the director 12 years to master. And master he does in his finest film to date, Boyhood. In this film, Linklater assembled a cast of actors who filmed scenes every year for the past decade plus two. We moviegoers watch these characters literally grow and age before us in this simple tale about a child growing from childhood into adulthood. (Director Michael Apted used a similar concept with his 7 Up series of documentaries that followed a group of youngsters into their elder years and chronicled their lives every seventh year.) In both films, the results are fascinating in their visual observations about our changing world of trends and styles. In Boyhood, we see the physical and emotional growth of one boy and how his life can change and quickly evolve due to commonplace events created by his family. This is a raw and honest portrait of a family coming undone.We meet Mason (Ellar Coltrane), age 7, his sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), and his parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke), already divorced. We immediately relate to this innocent child and begin to realize the helplessness and vulnerability that any child can face under parental rules. Their life directly effect Mason as he adapts to the different surroundings and people that come in and out of his life. Linklater's story may deal with a fictional family, but the universality of the child becoming the common denominator between his guardians makes this film so powerful. A child becomes the naive pawn to the whims and divisiveness of his parents. Boyhood reinforces that concept repeatedly.Many directors have been intrigued by a child's point of view about life itself. John Hughes made a career about growing up, Terrance Mallick tried to depict a child's view of the world in his visually stunning The Tree of Life and was partially successful, that is, until his metaphysical musings got the best of him. Other films on that same subject include Robert Mulligan's To Kill A Mockingbird and Summer of 42, Rob Reiner's Stand by Me, Ang Lee's The Ice Storm, Sam Mendes' American Beauty, and Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, to name a few. Yet Linklater's film has a special significance in its execution. While there are occasional glaring omissions with established supporting characters who simply disappear and some scenes that call for better clarity, the screenplay thoughtfully places its characters into recognizable situations and life passages (the long car rides and strained conversations, the traditional birthday parties, family dinners that never quite unite anyone, graduation day, etc.). The director focuses on the child, stressing the flaws of the adults as they try to overcome their poor decisions. This trickle down effect, from parent to child, and the problems it manifests is the essence of the film. As Mason matures and his parents act out their petty arguments and aspirations in order to find themselves, we see the dysfunction of the family and instantly connect to this quartet of characters in various ways.The actors are wonderful. Ellar Coltrane is perfectly cast as Mason. His performance is subtle and quite remarkable. As a young child, he is completely natural in his wide-eyed reactions to his family members. As he matures into adolescence, this actor shows more depth with his teenage mood swings and disdain for the adult world. Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter, is a young actress with major talent. Their sibling rivalry conveys just the right degree of love and aggression found between sons and daughters. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke create full bodied characters as their parents. Ms. Arquette has more emotional scenes as a single parent who wants a better life, even if her choice in men is questionable and Mr. Hawke plays the part of the man-child, more interested in being a friend than accepting the patriarch role.Special kudos go to Kari Perkins' costumes which have the simple period details that define each characters personalities, strong production design by Rodney Becker and Gary Studebaker, and lovely photography by Lee Daniel and Shane F. Kelly, all of which contribute greatly to the film's overall success. Foremost, the understated editing of Sandra Adair seamlessly connects all those many years into one cohesive film, a dauntless task. Clocking in at almost three hours (although the movie never lags), Linklater's drama is a major achievement in filmmaking. There are scenes of utter beauty and joy mixed with moments of such sadness and despair. Such is life. Such is Boyhood.

BOYHOOD,25 August 2018,7/10,"My Rating : 7/10So, it's based around a family and the main character and how their life progresses over 12 years. It's 2 hrs 45 mins which is long for a Hollywood movie.The more I want to pass a judgment or review on it, the more I feel it's best left alone. The film is like life itself. Existential, family drama, wordy...all over the place, just like life. Or in other words...well...kinda boring?"
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,4/10,"Seriously, the only thing epic about this film was its length. It literally dragged on and on. There was nothing groundbreaking about the technology or story, Patrica Arquette and Ethan Hawke gave very good performances but then again they're very good actors. There is nothing new here, I was shocked as I invested hour after hour of my life watching something that never really went anywhere, just telling a story of the life of pretty much every other person living in America in the 21st century. Do not get me wrong, I am not one of the anti-boyhood critics and I certainly didn't think the film was boring, I just I expected more after reading rave review after rave review."
BOYHOOD,12 August 2014,7/10,"We see Mason from his life at age 7 until he is a college freshman at age 18. The movie starts with Mason and his sister Samantha being picked up by their Dad for a weekend trip. Dad and Mom had already divorced. We then see Mason and Samantha's experience as life as they go through having a step brother and a step sister as Mom remarries. They also go through the bad times as the step dad and Mom divorce. The movie also shows scenes where Mason and Dad bond together as father and son. There are also scenes of Samantha's life and experiences, but the main focus, about 60 to 65 percent of the movie, is about Mason. At the end parts, we see Mason graduate from high school and then move out his Mom's place and being a freshman at college.Well, the story rolls out nicely, being very slow at the first five minutes or so and then progressed to a normal, not so fast not so slow pace until the movie ends. The story has so much detail in it. In a way it's nice because we can see Mason's life in a full and complete view, enabling us to fully understand the background of Mason's later thinking and behaviors. Yet the thing is that the movie gets to be very long, getting to almost three hours in runtime. This make the movie only enjoyable to people who are patient enough to stay and sit in front of the screen to watch it to the end. Even for me, who watched it on a pause-able internet video file, was not able to stay on it for the straight 165 minutes. I finished watching it in two days. I guess this is what we'll get if a crew that that's used to make a movie with scenes of long conversations, like what they did in the 'Before' Trilogy, decides to film a movie in the span of twelve years. They weren't willing to scrap much detail, resulting in the swelling of the runtime.I agree that this movie is unique, in a sense that although it sounds like a typical biography that film the different times of someone's life, this movie instead do quite the opposite. Boyhood (2014) doesn't always focus on the focus character Mason Jr. Yet the movie alternates the focus also to the closest persons to him, which are Dad, Mam, and his sister Samantha. Also the story doesn't contain any drastic things that Mason himself have do or endure. These things enrich the telling of Mason's life and world surrounding him.It's nice how the script encompasses the real life events in the filming process. Shooting live events such as the baseball game, and inserting the Obama/Biden campaign thing are great example to show what happened in Mason's life at the he reaches a certain age. Those also keep the whole story and the characters anchored to the real world's time line.The acting is quite a nice overall. Patricia Arquette is the one that performed best in this movie in my opinion. She can get the continuum of Mom's past experiences to be engraved and reflected in the way Mom speaks, and makes her facial expressions in the later stages of the movie. Ellar Coltrane did a flat acting here, so did Lorelei Linklater. Yet Ethan Hawke is quite nice in depicting the quite carefree Dad.My rating for Boyhood (2014) is a solid 7. It's a great movie, and yes it's entertaining. But the sheer length makes it not very much enjoyable at a straight out watch from the start to the end. Thus from me a recommendation to watch in the cinemas is a straight no. I do recommend you to watch it through a pause-able mean."
BOYHOOD,11 July 2015,5/10,"It's been quite a time since I saw ""Boyhood"" and I didn't even feel like saying boo. But today I am convinced that its main achievement as cinema, is having been shot in 12 years, obviously without heavy pressure or anguish, for Richard Linklater had time enough to make a 21-minute short, two features with Jack Black (!), to sequels to ""Before Sunrise"", a remake of ""The Bad News Bears"", a feature-length sports documentary, a pilot for a TV series, six episodes for another TV series, and two more features. He was very busy, so I can't help joking a bit and say that it seems he was only waiting for Ellar Coltrane to grow an inch or for Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette getting new grey hair to recruit a crew and add a few more minutes to ""Boyhood"". For me there was nothing novel or passionate in this story of a dysfunctional family: what impressed me the most was the section dedicated to the alcoholic husband played by Marco Perella, but his case is dismissed with indifference, just as the next husband, a policeman. However I found quite revealing that Linklater does not allude to any of the various political, social or economic crisis that United States went through (in its territory and abroad) for 12 years, since the shooting started, after September 11, 2001. I can understand that the characters live apart from what happens in their country or in the world, since the whole planet seems to live with the back turned on what's going on anywhere. But in the end, the story seems somehow anodyne, for what Linklater (as the master mind) ended up doing was an enclosed film about a self-absorbed society, and not any society, but the one that is our current empire. And I am a bit fed up of watching imperial and Caucasian portraits of broken families, abusive husbands, graduations, first loves, family reunions, etcetera. Maybe something happens and I did not notice it, or maybe this film is for Cinderella fans who can read between the lines the subliminal messages, that, come on, could have been hidden in an 80-minute product that would also show how Ellar Coltrane grew up. The 182 awards and the 160 nominations registered by IMDb prove nothing. Remember what happened to Galileo or poor Robert Altman. It is worth mentioning that, starting with the documentary ""Seven Up!"" (1964), in which several 7-year-old British kids were interviewed about different topics, director Michael Apted has been revisiting them and shooting every seven years, resulting in the films ""7 Plus Seven"" (1970), ""21 Up"" (1977), ""28 Up"" (1984), ""35 Up"" (1991), ""42 Up"" (1998), ""49 Up"" (2005) and ""56 Up"" (2012); and that Michael Winterbottom shot ""Everyday"" (2012) for five years, to record the sentence of his main character in jail, and how it affected the man's physique."
BOYHOOD,16 January 2020,9/10,"Pretty good movie! Very impressive, and it's deep bro."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,3/10,"I realize that many critics have raved about this movie. That's why I rented it. I was sorely disappointed, however. In fact, it took me two evenings to get through this.There is nothing wrong with this movie - other than that it rambles with no sense of direction to pull me in. (After Sunset and Before Sunrise held my attention. This did not.) The characters certainly come off as very convincing, very real. But because the narrative is not shaped, I never developed any interest in them, never wanted to know more about any of them. The lives of average people are not, in fact, interesting unless a good artist figures out how to present them in an interesting way.One example: near the end of the movie, when the son prepares to leave for college, the mother breaks down, saying that she feels there is nothing to look forward to anymore in her life. Yet she has been teaching in some sort of college for years by this point. It's not as if she has a mindless job. So where did this come from? Why does nothing else in her life give her any satisfaction? The role is important enough that Ms. Arquette, the actress, has been nominated for a best supporting actress Golden Globe award. Yet we know nothing about her other than what we can see from the scenes in which she appears. The director never helps us explore her inner life. We just see an occasional eruption.It was an interesting idea, but I think it needed a better director to make the results for effective, at least for me."
BOYHOOD,24 September 2015,5/10,"Boyhood is a movie that may never be duplicated. It was filmed over the course of 12 years, so just imagine how much of a pain in the ass everything must have been. Seeing a boy grow up before your eyes is a real treat and something that should be experienced. But it is not as good as people say. If this was filmed over the course of one year and had different actors, NOBDY would care for this.Boyhood follows the everyday life of Mason Evans Jr. The everyday life of someone if boring, that is why you can see where reality show are rigged. But this does a good job of transcending the audience into the life of a kid for 12 years. We observe major parts in his life, as well as the people that affect him. Although major parts and people are covered, I didn't find any of the characters, including Mason himself, to be very strong or deeply developed. Director Richard Linklater didn't have a finished script, and he just wrote everything over the years, making everything spontaneous. The spontaneity was a bad move. The characters have no chemistry or development and nothing happens. No point!Patricia Arquette won an Oscar for her performance as Mason's mother. She is a talented actress who plays a very unlikeable mother. Her and Ethan Hawke had two kids but got divorced. Ethan Hawke did a good job in his role. Early in the movie, Arquette moves with her kids to Houston where she goes to college in hopes of getting better work. Okay, so they move and it must be hard on everyone. But they move to different places in Texas throughout the whole movie. She is a psychology major (and later a teacher) and she doesn't even face her problems, just runs away. I really felt bad for the kids. Her packing up and moving throughout the movie was unrealistic in my book. When she moves to Houston and enrols in school, she marries one of her professors. This whole situation happened way too fast. Maybe the director wanted the audience to feel awkward like the kids, but he could have done so by showing their relationship grow and blossom instead of meeting him and getting married all within one minute. He is an abusive alcoholic and she eventually takes her kids and flees. I understand that she married him because he had a stable job and the kids needed to grow up in a well-rounded family, but we should have seen more long before she gets married.That is pretty much the other big miss of this film: it has no stability and just randomly jumps around. There are scene with no leads (such as Arquette's marriages) that can be really confusing and random. It also doesn't have a very strong flow throughout the movie. Other movies that cover someone's entire life have better flows than this.But I must admit how much of an achievement this was. Seeing a boy grow up in a little less than 3 hours is a technical achievement. Other than that, there is really nothing else that this movie really has to offer. Sure it is coming of age, but none of the executions are that strong. The universal praise is unanimous, as if people's votes were directly influenced. Mine wasn't. Although I do find this to be a great movie, I would not rank it number 1 (or even top 10). I honestly don't care if I ever see it again.2/4"
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,8/10,"What a kick ""Boyhood"" was to watch. Director and writer Linklater has put together what can certainly be qualified as ""a labor of love"". This is a movie that has strong originality (although we've seen the idea on Youtube in pictures) to be able to capture pockets of filming time. With it's spread over time, it interestingly transcends into a varying journey, where make-up, aging, and even facets of acting all become unnecessary - Linklater let's time between shooting do it's work experimentally. You can see the rapport and genuineness from many actors involved. Linklater's daughter actress Lorelei steals the show for the first quarter or so of the movie while younger and then magically grows up! Some of the stronger scenes with palpable drama involve Marco Parella as Bill the drunk and ultimately abusive stepfather. Children and step children become victims and are emotionally hurt. I also enjoyed the final scene between Arquette and Coltran where she laments the passing of time. Good show and great project."
BOYHOOD,20 January 2015,4/10,"We watch Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) life from age 6 to 18 as he goes thru his mother's (Patricia Arquette) marriages and divorces.Here's the thing: Most stories have a beginning, a middle and an ending with some kind of conflict in between that is eventually resolved and everyone goes home happy. Here we have an extended Seinfeld story without any comedy/humor and where nothing happens. And this goes on for nearly 3-hours. 3-Hours!!! And, we are not happy. The real pull (or why everyone wanted to see this) in here is watching a movie that took 12-years to make and noticing the growth and development of all the cast concentrating on Mason, of course. Here is what Mason sees: adults arguing, fighting with sister Samatha (Lorelei Linklater), looking at a catalog of women bras and panties, email, some politics resulting in ranting by his Dad (Ethan Hawke), listening to adults cursing in front of him and his sister, getting an overbearing abusive stepfather, getting another stepfather who is okay but has overbearing structural issues for Mason, smoking, drug use, alcohol. Generally Mason has no structure, no ambition, and doesn't know what he wants out of life. Add to this: a protective mother who doesn't really do that good of a job. Plus all the moving from city to city. Here what we don't see: Mason's first kiss, prom night, getting a driver license, having a really good friend to confide in at each new city, any real ambition within himself. And we don't see humor anywhere. That's sad. To be fair, there are some characters who do try to instill some structure into Mason, but he takes all this with a grain of salt and doesn't see the point in anything when he feels he is the controlled. He does have a talent for taking photos but even he isn't too thrilled with his talent. Ethan Hawke is a good actor but there were times as Mason's dad where he was annoying trying too hard to connect with Mason and Samantha. Eventually, this leveled out thank goodness. Too many scenes jumped around without any explanation. The mother is married again, divorced again, in a new house again, in a new city again. Sub titles on the screen may have helped to show time marching on. Didn't happen and we were left to figure it out for ourselves. Patricia Arquette as Mason's mother steals the show. Her scenes show the most concern with that pleading voice that is so correct for any situation. She was the only one who was animated in a good way. In the end we do see that she didn't pay enough attention to Mason as she should have. She had her issues. This movie is wrong in showing a boy's life as it tells us that parents' divorces and marriages are the norm. And, they are not. For this reason, the divorces should not have been a part of this movie with this title. The title is misleading. Again, this is way too long and not representative of a boy's life for the reasons described above. And, again, the title is misleading. And again: 3-Hours???!! Give me a break. (4/10)Violence: Yes, briefly. A stepfather losing it Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, at times"
BOYHOOD,3 April 2015,10/10,"This story follows a boy named Mason from the age of six to the age of eighteen, years that are formative for most males in the United States. At the film's opening the time is 2002 and the place is Texas. While Mason's story is specific to that one life, it is not atypical of middle-class white males growing up in the time period, particularly in the Midwest. That is one of the beauties of this movie, it not only documents a life but also provides a window on a twelve year span in the history of America. While no dates are flashed on the screen to tell what time period it is, enough background details are supplied to pin down the time: the Iraq war on TV, popular music, the publication of a Harry Potter book, the 2008 presidential campaign, video games, clothing, hair styles, drug use, and so forth. This movie also shows how culture shapes a personality.What might initially appear to be a gimmick, the use of the same actors at one-year intervals throughout the twelve year time span, I found this to be much more effective than having different actors play the parts at certain ages. Using the same actors lends a documentary aspect that would have been difficult to achieve by using different actors. Also, there is no problem in getting the period details right.As Mason, Ellar Coltrane is quite believable--the fact that he is not an accomplished actor is a plus in that respect. Director Linklater was taking a risk in gambling that Coltrane would work out over a period of twelve years, that he would even want to continue with the project. All the actors ring true. Patricia Arquette is effective as Mason's mom, a woman who has a knack for choosing undesirable mates--as her second husband, Marco Perella masterfully portrays a man who initially seems reasonable enough, but ultimately becomes a total ass. His character is so disgusting that I often wonder how actors can get themselves to behave so abominably.Movies like this are valuable. Think how wonderful it would be to have a multitude of such movies covering different personalities from different time periods. How interesting it would be to trace the life of a woman growing up in San Francisco in the 1930s. ""Boyhood"" will increase in value as time goes on. I wonder why Texas offers a setting for so many excellent, intimate films about growing up in the 1950s, such as ""The Tree of Life"", ""The Last Picture Show"", and ""Hud"".There are some truly great scenes in ""Boyhood,"" like the scene with Mason and his dad (Ethan Hawke) in Antone's bar in Austin where Hawke is trying to console Mason over his recent breakup with his girlfriend. Not only does that scene have strong emotional content, it is beautifully filmed. The lighting shows much skill in balancing foreground and background lighting, using background lighting for increased effect. Also, Charlie Sexton and a band provide some fantastic classic rock music as background for that scene. The scene where Hawke discusses safe sex with his kids in a bowling alley is priceless.This movie grew on me as it went along and by the end I was deeply involved with the characters."
BOYHOOD,7 August 2014,9/10,"Films like Boyhood are difficult to sum up. It's quite like life - it defies structure, it doesn't need it. Instead it deserves an extended ramble, cobbled together over a long period of time. The film has been met with unprecedented acclaim, perhaps over-excitedly so for a film as subdued as this. It has a modest ambition, one not quite as difficult as it appears to be, just patient and risk-taking for its initial year. However, Boyhood is fundamentally flawed due to that concept. It's nothing to do with Linklater's intention as he's simply throwing his test tube baby into the wild and seeing how it plays. These flaws are just part of its art and why it's fascinating. The most interesting aspect of the film isn't the content but the presentation with the way in which the film unfolds. Contrary to how you may expect from a film like this, it flows very fluidly with no bookends to its sequences, defying cinematic ideas of setup and payoff, theme and consequence. The pacing is dense, near rushing through its 166 minute runtime. The time flies by but to a fault. We never truly grow close to the characters, instead we simply grow familiar. Perhaps that's what the film tries to communicate about relationships and the people who come in and out of our lives and how we never truly really get to know them or get under their skin. That's a sobering fact if true. We may step in their shoes for a moment but the film cushions any moments of tension with the fact that it can skip the consequences and move on a year that it feels like the film has zero stakes.As a result, we never invest in the characters in a satisfying way, only relate to them at times of conflict and growth. As we watch the characters age and change, a sense of identity becomes questionable. Who are we if we are constantly in flux? Is that why we can never know someone? We are simultaneously the person we are, were and will be, in a kind of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five 'unstuck in time' sense. It's an idea and anxiety unique to Boyhood and an important one to bring up in this medium, an idea that we otherwise escape in fantasy. The moment we live in matters but so does the big picture. The film doesn't always leave us cautiously alone in this idea though as sometimes it's so big that it feels like it eclipses the triviality of what's going on right now. There's symbolism along the way, perhaps entirely unintentional, such as our protagonist Mason receiving a suit that doesn't fit yet for his birthday. We have to let ourselves grow into these things on our journey in life.The film isn't always immediately thought-provoking though. As it's all a day-in-the-life things, it never tries to prod too much meaning out of a small stone. You are left salivating for something to digest as the experience washes over you, especially as its eventual musings in the second half are overt discussions on screen. It's fine wine that needs to settle, a cocktail of feelings rather than explicitly emotional but that makes it feel more authentic and like the daily contradictions of life. The kid acting is expectedly amateur but they do grow confident with age and are full of life at a young age. Parents Patricia Arquette and especially Ethan Hawke are the highlight. He may essentially be his Jesse character from the Before series, but his presence lifts the film like no other actor can. He dishes out theorised wisdom when you know he's just making it up as he goes along. His character arc is the most refreshing to see as he goes from down to up. Arquette is terrific when the film needs her but otherwise fittingly blends into the background when it doesn't.You could pick out any scene and it could feel like it sums up life. One sticks out most, Arquette's final moments wherein she laments how she expected more out of life. It's a deeply touching sentiment that cuts to the core of everything. The experience of life and the experience of Boyhood is simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. Sometimes it's so chaotic and complex that it feels like an impossible riddle and sometimes it's tediously simple and mundane. It's never cookie cutter but it's not too complex. While there are some worldwide aspects of pop culture that touch nostalgic nerves, especially its topical-at-the-time soundtrack, it is apparent that Boyhood is an account of an American boyhood as it gets very American when politics, guns and the Bible get involved. It's not too relatable for those outside of Texas but that doesn't always get in the way as it relishes in the universal.Despite all this profound depth the film has potential for, the content itself can be quite clichéd and uninteresting and that does hold it back especially upon reflection. Contrived moments of melodrama and consequence-less events leave you cold weeks after. But it's a film that needs to be experienced rather than savoured. Its aesthetics are unremarkable but it's not concerned with that. It would be better if it could reflect the energy you'd expect from the banner with 'boyhood' on it, though the film does get darker as Mason enters puberty. These problems only hold it back from being favourite worthy with the rest of the Before series and it's still a brilliant and precious achievement. It's too subjective an experience to call the film an undeniable masterpiece that everyone should like, but that subjectivity is what feeds it into being so likable. It doesn't give you what you wanted but it gives you what you need.9/10"
BOYHOOD,9 April 2020,7/10,"Notwithstanding the fact that I don't agree with the use of actors younger than 16 in sex conversations, this movie is a real and authentic portrait of nowadays children and adolescents and the way their parents deal with them. This is the particular story of a young boy from childhood to adolescence with all the problems of his relationship with adults namely with his divorced mother and his estranged father. The movie runs smoothly and pleasant to watch through all the scenes regarding these views."
BOYHOOD,8 November 2014,10/10,"Boyhood maybe one of the best film this reviewer has since this decade - I cannot think of any other film that celebrates cinema and reflects what film can be better than this - not Winter Bone or The Artist, not No Country For Old Men or Crazy Heart - they were entertaining, but Linklater has created an unforgettable cinematic experience - and let's face it's pretty seldom these days that we can say that.This is hugely watchable, without twists or plot, it's all just arc - boyhood from 5 to 18 captured - shot over 12 years with the same crew and actors, the result has an openness, honesty, and frankness that is plain, simple, and yet engaging, and truly, deeply satisfying. Its semi-documentary approach and fantastic casting reward the viewer with what both Jarmusch and Malik would love to show, but does so without an ounce of posing or posturing.This is cinema. It has more to say about both film and life in a simple straight-forward manner, but it's also done in a way that deserves all the possible recognition and encouragement."
BOYHOOD,5 May 2016,8/10,"I definitely enjoyed the second half less than the first... but the mom having a meltdown made it bearable, because it kind of brought things around full circle. She's upset that life has passed her by, and it just makes you wonder if he's going to be looking back on his life in 30 years, and thinking the same thing... That's the point about growing up, I guess - you don't realise it's happened until it's already gone... The beauty of the structure of this film is that it allows the audience to preserve moments that have already become foggy, for the characters.There are slow spots over the runtime, but it has a stronger point than some of Linklater's other slice-of-life projects (""Slacker"", for instance!)."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,9/10,"Boyhood is an exceptionally rare cinematic gem with something far more unique to offer than an average straightforward narrative. It is an enchanting coming-of-age tale firmly driven by childhood nostalgia and astonishingly authentic portrayal of growing up. Showcasing the life of a young lad from his early days in elementary school to his inauguration into adulthood, this movie sheds light on the atmosphere of growing up in a way Hollywood has never done before, and the mastermind behind this feat is director Richard Linklater. Notable for his humanistic entries such as 'Dazed and Confused' and the 'Before' trilogy, Linklater takes an vigorously audacious task of casting the four main actors in the same roles over the course of 12 years, shooting from the summer of 2002 and ending in the summer of 2013. The final product is a realistic, nostalgia-fueled journey that allow viewers to watch as both the actors and characters evolve before our very eyes. This movie chronicles the life of Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane), a young boy growing up in Texas with his older sister Samantha (played by Loreli Linklater) and his mother (played by Patricia Arquette) who is now divorced from their father (played by Ethan Hawke). The story opens up the story of Mason from age of six to his young adulthood at the age of 18.Richard Linklater is an ambitious filmmaker with an extremely admirable methodology of capturing the innocence of youth and the trials and tribulations of growing up with immense authenticity. This coming-of-age tale represents an astounding feat that Hollywood has never achieved before, and that is capturing the growth of a child and his family in a way that injects viewers with the feel that they are not only watching characters, but actually growing up with them. In fact, the characters here feel barely even feel like characters but instead real people. The prime basis of this story deals with the major milestones people reach throughout their lives as children. How many of you remember your first move? Your first kiss? Your first time in a new school? The story also touches base on more serious aspects such a divorce, domestic abuse, and the struggle of finding your place in the world. Venturing through a twelve-year period, this film gradually dips into the life of the lead character Mason as he faces trials of growing up to a young man. Gambling to each year of his life from 2002 to 2013, the film uses various cultural references signaling the transition from one year to the next. Some of which include soundtrack featuring songs by Coldplay and Sheryl Crow to name a few, and other dated events such as the Harry Potter festival in 2004, and Presidential election of 2008. Linklater effectively tells the story with immense legitimacy while fueling plenty of nostalgia for those who remember growing up during these years. In the process, he avoids emotional manipulation to keep things realistic. While some may complain about the film lacking in plot, the truth is this film does in fact come with a plot. The plot is passage of time and the changes it leads to as we grow older and reach our adulthood and eventually retirement. Whereas most filmmakers choose to cast different actors in the fill in the roles of a character in various ages, this film stars the same actors who sustained throughout the twelve-year period of the project. It is an extraordinary rare gimmick that allows viewers to witness the physical evolution of each actor as they age. It also marks an incredibly bold move by Richard Linklater considering the dangers that could have crippled the project. One of which being the law that actors cannot be contracted to work on a single project above the maximum of seven years. Stepping in the role of young Mason is Ellar Coltrane, an actor who gives blissful performance in a role that progresses throughout his character's long childhood, to him as a young adult. Patricia Arquette shines validly in her role as the mother who shows deep love and care for her children, but struggles to finding a suitable career for herself as well as the love of her life, a struggle that at point lands her in a second marriage that puts her and her children on the heat of domestic abuse. Ethan Hawke, a frequent collaborator with Linklater, does his job as the loving, but financially slacking father. Loreli Linklater, Mason's older sister, gives a typical portrayal of a teen girl with both smart and slightly rebellious streak of a teenager. If her last name sounds familiar, that is because she happens to be daughter of the director Richard Linklater. Then there is a sporadic string of pop in and out of the film leaving the fate of their characters (such as the abusive husband's children) unknown. This just represents the allegory of how people come in and out of our lives as time rolls on. Boyhood is a mesmerizing cinematic treasure blooming with arguably the most authentic and inspiring coming-of-age tales Hollywood has ever endeavored. It is a spectacular achievement by Richard Linklater who introduces an incredibly untold gimmick that is not likely to be used again any time soon. Afterall, a twelve-year period is quite a long for a production company to hold onto a single project."
BOYHOOD,14 November 2014,8/10,"Boyhood was nice laid film which had cult status written all over it and was will be cherished for its stupendous performance by Patricia Arquette.Boyhood is coming-of-age drama of a boy named Mason from the age 5 till he turns 18.From the director of Before Midnight, Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, Richard Linklater should be given accolades for shooting the movie over a span of 12 years with protagonist. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film's scenario. Writing is skillful. Editing could have been better. Special mention to Cinematography for capturing the essence of nature so ecstatically. Story and screenplay has been handled so efficiently that you would not feel bored ever. Art direction is magnificent. Dialogues are superb and inspiring. The child actor who plays the part of Mason does justice to his part. But it is Patricia Arquette who steals the thunder. The actor is effective and carries the part of Mason's mom with such an ease. So , overall , a superb movie in all respect. Excellent 4/5"
BOYHOOD,23 August 2016,5/10,"Boyhood was a movie most took to be done , it took more than 10 years to make even the film being acclaimed by the public and particularly by the critics , I found overrated , because I found a boring movie , starting with the script that drags , is longer than it should moments , the direction of Richard Linklater , is good , the more it errs in some decisions , a positive point is the cast and the acting , Ethan Hawke this very well , Patricia Arquette is the best thing in the film, Oscar deserved Ellar Coltrane is an actor a good future , he sent well in this film , and the cast also has other good actors , I found the moments he is still a child the best film and the most interesting , Boyhood is a film median in my opinion , not managed to captivate me , and not to mention that is too long out, what makes the tiring. Note 5.4"
BOYHOOD,29 January 2015,10/10,"I was went into this with a little trepidation, partly having to do with expectations and partly because, at 166 minutes long, it might be a daunting watch. Thankfully, none of that adversely affected my enjoyment of what I feel to be (in retrospect) the best film of 2014. While what Richard Linklater did might not be completely unprecedented (re: the UP documentary series, which I've only heard of but not seen), I do believe this is the first fiction film to use the same group of actors over a long period of time for the purpose of showing how they grow and change.There is almost no point in discussing a story or plot, because there isn't one in the strictest sense. What you have amounts to a series of vignettes which capture a series of moments in the life of a person, in this case Mason (Ellar Coltrane). It was fascinating to watch him grow up and experience life before my very eyes. Early on, he experiences the pain of his mother divorcing, twice, and both times to alcoholics. He's an awkward child, and gets picked on. He fights with his sister. I could go on, but I feel like I'd be robbing potential viewers of some of the spontaneity of seeing this unfold for the first time.Still, despite the improvisational nature of the film, nothing is haphazardly put together. While the first half to two-thirds of the film is more of a collage of experiences, Linklater does attempt to wrap things up by offering some philosophical insight into the life these characters have lived, and by extension, the audience. There are two scenes in particular which I believe sum up whatever message can be gleaned from this film. Both of them take place after Mason's graduation. The first is with his father as he visits a friend who now plays in a band in a bar. The second is with his mother as he is about to leave the house for college. You'll know them when you see them, and while nothing particularly profound is said it still seemed very honest and realistic. In fact, this entire film felt real in a way I haven't felt watching something in a long time, completely free of any pretension. This film runs the gamut of emotions that can be felt, and captures what it must feel like to grow up as a child of divorce.On a more technical side, most of the acting was pretty good. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette were excellent, though, and both gave awards-worthy performances. Ellar Coltrane as Mason wasn't bad, but wasn't superb either. I guess you could say he was rather naturalistic in his approach, but he didn't really blow me away. Sadly, Lorelei Linklater (the director's daughter) was probably the biggest sore spot in the cast, but fortunately she takes more of a back seat in the later years. She wasn't cringe-worthy, but certainly not up to the standards of the rest of the cast. As far as cinematography was concerned, I thought it was very efficient and didn't call attention to itself, instead letting the performances stand out. I also liked the soundtrack, save one cut ('Crank That (Soulja Boy)'). And beyond the great performances, it was nice to take a trip down memory lane as each vignette had some small discussion or reference which placed it in time and made it that much more relatable.Overall, I can't praise this film more highly. Is it perfect? No, but what film is? What makes this one great was its devotion to character, and a raw and honest view of life that showed a lot of heart. So, even if you don't normally watch indie films I highly recommend that you give this a try. The time will fly by."
BOYHOOD,20 May 2019,7/10,"From 2002-2013, this film tells the trials and joys of a Texas family. At the beginning, Mason (7 years old) and Samantha (9 years old) live with their single mother while having occasional visits from their father. In the years that follow, there is a lot of moving, education choices, new relationships, and growing up.This film is rightly praised for its very unique approach. It was filmed in sequences once a year for each year of the story. The same actors were used so we could see the effects of aging, especially in the children, with no need for special make-up or role replacements with older look-alike actors. For this very unique approach, the kudos are rightly deserved.But speaking of kudos, it is well known that this is one of the most critically acclaimed movies in a long time earning almost unanimously perfect ratings. I found ""Boyhood"" to be a good film but not an excellent one. It certainly does well to maintain interest constantly during its nearly three-hour run. It also exposes the sides of life that challenge most of us especially during teen years when we are constantly being told to ""buckle up"" because ""life is tough"". During many interesting discussions, these attitudes are challenged. These conversations are very engaging.So while I don't agree with all the average rating of this film, I still give it praise for its uniqueness. There are also fine performances by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the divorced parents, particularly Arquette."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,9/10,"Boyhood feels less like a film than like an experience. The 12-year document of a little boy growing up feels unstructured. There are almost no dramatic climaxes. Indeed many key scenes (the mother's two divorces, the father's second marriage) happen off-camera. Leaps to another time period are marked by hero Mason's advance in age. Perhaps one speech captures this point: We don't seize the moment, Mason tells his new girlfriend, the moment seizes us. We live in the grip of the now. The title is dramatized by the first two shots: a clouded blue sky, then a close up of six- year-old Mason's face.The sky is the universe and it's both clear and clouded, the boy an individual life, ditto. The film uses one boyhood to evoke Everyboy's growing through the tribulations of life. Young Mason faces a range of options to determine what kind of a man he will be. The two stepfathers want to remake him into a more conventional macho image. The first cuts his hair off, the second tries to remake his manner. Both are as brutish as the older boys' swagger in the indoor camping scene.The adults pass through parallel self-realizations. The father (Ethan Hawke) starts out as an irresponsible man child who grows into an effective father and eventually into a second family, where he achieves the maturity he tried to avoid. He goes from cool GTO to suburban van. But when he offers to help pay for Mason's grad party he still has an empty wallet. When his loser friend Jim ends up with a very good rock band, he too achieves his kind of fulfilment even if it falls short of his desired stardom. Mason's mother has the most dramatic growth. The single parent mother of two goes back to school, does a Master's in Psychology and ends up a Psych prof with both kids in college. She careens through two other marriages in which apparently mature men turn into abusive alcoholics. She survives the most dramatic adversity. In an ominous cycle, her second marriage is to her professor, the third to her student, a mature veteran. The Psych prof proves a nut case. The second in the monotony of civilian life forgets the lesson that served him well in Iraq: to respect the people he deals with. Both men redefine themselves as forms of Corrections Officer. When Mason goes off to college, despite her pride and love his mother feels dashed. ""I thought there'd be more."" In life as in movies we're raised to expect high drama, great achievements, some huge experience. Mason picks up this point when he discusses being jilted with his dad. ""What's the point?"" There is no point, he replies, it's just life, one moment after the next. There this film mirrors as it follows life, a sequence of small joys, challenges, and the beauties and stimulations of the moment. Nothing is big but the small resonates.Of course the film is much more structured than it seems. A few lines are repeated across the decades, e.g.,""Who are you going to be?"" Some of the song lyrics hit metaphoric points: e.g., ""Arrivals and Departures are side by side;"" ""The day I was born I began to die."" The music embodies the passage of time. Like the film's re-creation of the past, Mason's dad makes him a CD of post-breakup Beatles singles as a facsimile of the band's reunion. Director Linklater also notes the changing social background. The new tech unfurls, from the kid's video games through the cell phone to the computerized selection of college roommates. The political background is limned in the soldier's return from Iraq and Obama's election campaign against McCain. Mason's Dad's second wife comes from a Republican, Christian rifle-toting farm family, antithetic to his nature.There are also thematically focused scenes. When Mason visits his mother's lecture she's discussing the history of John Bowlby's Attachment Theory, which was in the air when that section was being shot. Bowlby contended that evolution required that primates develop secure bonds with their first caregivers to sustain them through life. That refocuses Mason's, his mother's and his sister Samantha's plot-lines. If the idea wasn't in Linklater's mind when he started filming it certainly emerged as his actors, characters and narrative developed. The last shot suggests a happy ending but without the clear closure we expect of a conventional film. As soon as they meet, Mason, his new roommate, his girlfriend and her roommate go hiking to catch a spectacular sunset. Mason and the other roommate are obviously attracted to each other, as they chat comfortably and avoid catching each other's glances. The film ends on them together, in a close-up, with the sky between them. The sky and closeup replay the opening but now the solitary kid is a man with a beautiful woman. They're not touching but they're connected. Their attachment is another small moment in the flow of small moments we've witnessed. We know what we want to happen between them but we don't know that it will. But that's the point. All we have is the moment. That's how life goes — and movies usually don't.

BOYHOOD,2 January 2016,7/10,"Boyhood is a film which is all about its idea. Director Richard Linklater tells a story which plays out over twelve years and does so by filming his movie over a period of twelve years. We are going to watch a boy grow up right before our eyes. You admire the ingenuity and certainly admire the passion everyone involved had to have to be able to see this project through. Linklater has crafted a film which is certainly unique. But uniqueness is not quite enough. The film also has to be entertaining and there Boyhood is very hit and miss. It's a great idea for a movie but you are left thinking that perhaps that idea could have been realized in more entertaining fashion.The story is exceedingly simple. We're going to watch young six-year old Mason grow up. It's not an easy childhood, no smooth journey to adulthood here. There are many bumps along the way which each, in their own way, will ultimately play a part in what kind of man this boy becomes. When first we meet him Mason is a charming little boy. But his life is a bit of a mess. His parents are divorced, he and his sister live with their mother who struggles to make ends meet. Their father fades in and out of their lives. Big changes come when other men come into Mom's life. Not necessarily changes for the better it turns out. As Mason grows into a teen he gets involved in the sort of questionable behaviors teens do. What type of man will Mason be when he comes out the other end? That is what the movie is all about, the journey to adulthood, the growth along the way. In its own way it is a fascinating journey, one unlike we've seen in any movie before. But that journey does get bogged down at times. This film, just by its very nature, was always going to take its sweet time in telling its story. But moving things along a little more quickly, with a little more energy, surely would not have hurt. Too often in this movie there really is nothing going on. This idea would make for a great documentary, and the film often does have a documentary feel to it. As entertainment though the film sometimes struggles.One of the obvious potential problems with this project is that when you cast a young boy you have no idea what kind of actor he is going to grow into over the course of twelve years. And, not surprisingly since this was his only real work as an actor, Ellar Coltrane did not grow into a very good performer. As the character grows the actor struggles, by the end Coltrane is exceedingly stiff, unnatural and unconvincing. The personality you would hope to see just isn't there. When he shares scenes with Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, who play Mason's parents, the contrast is jarring. Coltrane sadly can't come close to matching these seasoned performers. Arquette and Hawke both do great work in this movie, Coltrane and other younger, unseasoned performers struggle to keep up. The movie starts with great promise, but for various reasons, loses its way now and again as Mason moves towards adulthood. Sometimes there are lulls where not enough interesting things are happening. Some of the things that do happen are uncomfortable to sit through, there are some raw, painful moments here. The film also beats you over the head with a political agenda which is completely uncalled for in this story. And the ending is a bit of a letdown. There's no grand finish. Arquette's character, in what seems a jarringly out of character moment after all the time we've spent with her, says it herself: ""I just thought there would be more."" Give Linklater credit for his unique idea but acknowledge that he did not pull it off quite as well as maybe he could have. Some things, like his grown-up lead's acting ability, really were out of his control. But Linklater clearly made missteps of his own along the way. Boyhood is a great idea for a film but not really a great film. It's a good film, a unique journey worth seeing. But you get the sense it could have been something more than what it ultimately turned out to be."
BOYHOOD,9 February 2019,6/10,"Linklater-speak has small talk ascend and wrap around the universe, lift you into a higher consciousness and state of being...and if pure dialogue won't do it, the drugs will probably get you there. His films appear simplistic, and yet some are a puzzling contradiction. Everybody Wants Some, a packaged vignette with the style and tone of a lazy summer afternoon, was a film that Linklater could have made in his sleep. It's a story you snuggle and curl up to, bask in the nostalgia - all while he weeds out a pot-smoking Wyatt Russell, who has clearly overstayed his welcome in this era. Why even call out your guilty pleasures? Own them, don't apologise. Worse still, it was shot in pristine digital, so even the excuse of a technical upgrade for Dazed and Confused doesn't hold water.Boyhood, in its epic, decade-long documentation of an adolescent emerging, wants to tap into those same yearnings. There's nothing more nostalgic than hearing a track from your childhood. Or recalling sweaty Halo co-op matches after school. Or remembering the political fervour of Obama's presidential campaign. The film starts with a blast of Coldplay's Yellow, which I was surprised to realise was now 19 years old. Time sneaks up on you like that. But for much of this trip down memory lane, these feel less like authentic mementos and more like dated accumulations of pop culture. It's as if Linklater, in his elliptical, seamless editing, needs something universal to ground our sense of time in, and looked to the closest flashing billboard. The story may unfold like a life-sized documentary, shot in unadorned verite (no pesky, obvious captions to signal a new calendar year), but the audience markers are there all the same.So there's the other contradiction within Boyhood, with Linklater unfurling delicate vignettes that point to his skill in capturing a slice of life, but still determined to cycle through a series of defined periods. The relentlessness of this process refutes any ideas in the film's thesis of capturing 'just life'. The same time skips are the gulfs in-between his Before trilogy, but carry weight and consequence. In a masterwork like Before Sunset, the two protagonists meet cute for the second time in their lives, but far from indulging the youthful idealism of their first encounter, the pair must now reckon with their baggage of guilt and regret. They retrace their magical night in Vienna, but slight lines have emerged on their faces, and their steps are now more cautious.Mason ages before our eyes, but must follow a pre-ordained path (Linklater was always going to finish on that shot in the Big Bend, no matter the emphasis on script improvisation). That's part of the trouble in a project like this; you cast young and are locked in for the next decade. Ellar Coltrane grows physically, but there is only so much you can ascribe to a mop of hair and sunken eyes in place of acting talent (giving a teenager a camera does not make him an interesting person). Linklater's daughter is initially vivacious but reportedly became bored with the project, so her character shrinks into the background, barely wallpaper decor by film's end. Would the story's trajectory have changed if Lorelei Linklater hadn't grown restless? We'll never know. That's just life, I guess.Linklater positions the adult figures of Mason's life as shifting enigmas, sliding in and out of the centre of his universe. Some of these resemble ideological caricatures rather than genuine life lessons, as in the exhilarated earnesty of a fast-food chain manager dangling a promotion to fry cook over his head, or a dose of 'reality' delivered in a dark room by his photography teacher. Mason reacts with a surly shrug, his default position towards almost everything, which is understandable given these figures only want to package him into a smaller version of their own lives. And yet this reaction is mirrored in an almost identical fashion when Linklater wants to delve a little deeper. Olivia's third husband Jim is an alcoholic veteran, and the film stages one of his outbursts just as Mason returns home one night, way past his curfew. With tears in his eyes, he laments their lack of connection despite the fact that he has much more of a presence in their lives than Mason's blood father. But this falls on deaf ears: why should Mason care? His life is all about parties and backseat snogging with girls who we won't even see the face of. He shrugs, and so does the film.What's frustrating about this is that sometimes Boyhood gets it right, asking tough questions of fatherhood and how broken families must evolve and persevere without responding through clean, cookie-cutter answers that conventionally structured dramas tend to offer. One of these involves Mason realising that his father has traded his 1968 Pontiac GTO for the more family friendly minivan option, baffled that the man who once sported a soul-patch and roomed with a druggie could ever mature. The time skips work in favour for Hawke, whose intermittent appearances in his kid's lives say more about the pains of growing up than Mason himself ever could. In fact, a film focusing on Mason's parents would be infinitely more interesting. Imagine if the story had given actual weight to Arquette's arc, so that when she all but spits out the core theme in her penultimate Oscar monologue, it doesn't just feel like philosophical posturing. What of her own life, in how she is initially led by society to believe that kids must have father figures, must have steady families, before finally embarking on her own journey of independence? While the boy grew up, spare a thought for his parents, who scarcely had the time to plot their own paths."
BOYHOOD,25 August 2014,9/10,"(87%) Like nothing else out there, and for what is more or less a family drama; this is quite an unbelievable achievement. A year is a very long time to make one movie, so 12 is almost ridiculous and this is worth every hour. The editing featured is some of the finest ever put to film as Mason, along with everyone else, grows and ages in an effortlessly subtle way before your very eyes. Another benefit to the editing is the fact that this never bogs down, every scene feels relevant, and the pace is quite brisk. Performance wise Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's biological parents both bind everything together, and for piece focusing on one person this is very much an ensemble effort. The run- time is a tad excessive, but because there's so much to go through; with so much depth to so many different characters that overall it doesn't really matter. Without doubt this is a must-watch, even though I admire it slightly more that actually flat-out enjoying the film itself."
BOYHOOD,5 February 2015,7/10,"Growing up is tough, especially when there are cameras in your face from age 6 to 18. But that's what Richard Linklater decided to do with poor Ellar Coltrane, the star of Boyhood who grows up before your eyes in this three hour coming of age epic. Boyhood chronicles the life of Mason, his sister Samantha, and their two estranged parents played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. It's a scrapbook style series of events, some significant, others less so, that show a boy growing up and learning about the life, love, and the world at large. It takes us on a twelve year journey through adolescence, one that's captivating, compelling, boring, and dry, all at the same time. Now, as I'm sure everyone and their mother is aware, Boyhood has been getting a lot of praise. Like, A LOT of praise. I mean its got a straight up 100/100 on Metacritic. I went into this movie with a lot of hype on my shoulders, and coming out of it I find myself wondering if these reviews are praising the film itself or rather just the concept. Yes, Boyhood deserves all of its praise for what Linklater accomplished, telling his 12 year story over a 12 year shooting period. Getting these actors to commit for so long, and to be able to put it all together in a clean and polished feature film is obviously impressive. Yet, I find myself wanting there to be more to the meat of this film. The execution of this ambitious concept is astounding, but the story told here is underwhelming as a whole. Boyhood is definitely a good film, but for something that is telling a story in a whole new never-been-done-before way it should have been a great film. It should have been an amazing film. Instead I walked away from this pretty neutral. On the whole it's a well told, well put together story, and watching this kid grow up is a fascinating experience, but Boyhood lacks any blow you away moments or profound tearjerking. I found the trick is to not be waiting for anything. Instead you just take it piece by piece, giving every moment the same significance because it is all coming together for the sole purpose of completing this 12 year epic. This, of course, is fine. Movies are allowed to tell their stories like this, but with the lack of any compelling excitement I found it hard to become really attached. One of the biggest things that detached me from this film was, sadly, Ellar Coltrane's performance as he grew older. He starts the movie at 6 and I was really into the film at the start. There were a lot of things in young Mason's life that I found myself connecting to, whether it was his typical sibling rivalry relationship with his sister, or growing up in a time of political turmoil overseas, since I grew up during this same time, also in Texas. But as Mason grows up the performance becomes much more about just reading lines, and when Mason's character is supposed to be all profound I just couldn't take him seriously and it really pulled me out of the experience. A lot of the younger performers in this flick leave a lot to be desired and it's the adults, mainly Ethan Hawke, who carry the latter half of Boyhood. Nothing about Boyhood is actually bad though, except maybe for Coltrane's performance. If I had to assign one adjective to the whole of the film it would have to be ""underwhelming."" When I found myself starting to be compelled, the moment slipped away. When I found myself captivated by a performance, that character moved on to another part of their life. There was just not enough to grasp onto. Most of the performances are great and the writing is absolutely fantastic, but with so much hype surrounding Boyhood, I was expecting something with a little more life."
BOYHOOD,2 February 2020,9/10,"Impressive on its technical merits alone (it took more than a decade filming with the same actors), this literal coming-of-age film can be cliche and stereotypical at times, but that's what lends it the unique, and generic, childhood that most anyone can associate with. Don't let the 3-hour runtime scare you away: a lot of moments compose the process of growing up."
BOYHOOD,21 July 2014,10/10,"What they say about childhood coming and going in a heartbeat is very true. It's a moment of time that feels like an eternity when your ten years old yet feels like a second when your thirty. Anyone can agree that when you get older, time feels like that it's moving faster. So why is it that time goes much slower in childhood. I think it has to do with the way we learn things. Think about the first time you learned math. It's easy now to figure out what five plus four is; something like that we can figure out in a second. But go back to when you were learning addition for the first time.When we take on a new challenge, it's going to naturally take time literally to figure it out. Counting was a challenge at some point, but you eventually adapt to counting that it becomes a part of daily life. As we go up to the next level of mathematics, were so focused on learning division, fractions and algebra that we aren't challenged by something like addition anymore. We don't even think about it, it's just something we now simply do. Once we do stuff rather then think about that stuff, our time is spent working on more current events that take the skills we've adapted to. Going back to the challenges of childhood, it feels like a moment then an eternity because the things we learned then were basic and don't provide as much challenge in adulthood, giving us less time to ponder. Boyhood examines much of the basic ideals that that make us people. The simple idea behind this movie is that we follow one child from age seven through eighteen. It's not a documentary, but a fictional look from director Richard Linklater (School of Rock) who spent twelve years, going back once a year to film more footage until the child had grown up. The idea is very ambitious and what most people want to know is whether it was worth the wait. Boyhood is not a complex artsy exploration at the state of childhood nor does it even have a complex story. It's simply a boy named Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane) who goes through childhood along with his parents (played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) and sister Samantha (played by Lorelei Linklater). Stepparents, new schools, love and life fall into place as we become witnesses to Mason's journey into adulthood. That's it.Watching someone's life on cinema is nothing new, but to see it this extensively and impressive is something I haven't seen. Had it been done with various child actors, it would have not been as interesting. But watching young Mason going though life's troubles and mankind's flaws make me realize just how precious time really is. It helps that young actor Ellar Coltrane is just a force to look at. Watching him growing up is like watching my own child grow up. We get to see what kind of kid he was and go with him as we learn from his mistakes and his passion for photography bloom into an art.Mason doesn't have much of a personality until the second half of Boyhood, but it a way, he's not supposed to. He's the everyman that reacts off of the decisions of his family and environment. This allows for his ideology and thoughts to create his personality later on. Both Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke add much to a movie that needs great performances from everyone to make this situation work. Boyhood works because it all feels natural. There's no ""sudden heart attack/car accident/lottery win that changes everything"" scenario and I'm glad. This movie is a prime example of ""the stones that fall into place"".I'll give this ten photos of urban art out of five. Boyhood needs to be seen not just by adults but teens as well. This is definitely my favorite movie of 2014 so far."
BOYHOOD,27 November 2014,9/10,"Boyhood, is one of those films with so much to offer and so much insight and things that you constantly think about and relate to during the course of the film that I wish I had the opportunity to have seen it twice on the big screen. As with some of Richard Linklater's other films that were mostly dialogue driven, or philosophical at times (e.g. Slacker, Waking Life, the Before trilogy), I found that I liked all of those films upon my first viewings of them, but I liked them even more and found a lot more things to appreciate and things that I possibly missed, or couldn't quite grasp the first time around. This one time showing of Boyhood, at the theatre will be my only chance to have seen the film as it was shown through the university film series for a one night only event. I am just glad that I was able to see it once on the big screen and I guess for repeat viewings I could always buy the film, or even rent, or watch on television. I remember reading about Richard Linklater making a 12 year project back around the time he started filming Boyhood, or close to that time, or shortly after. At that point there was not all that much information available on it, but the premise and the way they went about doing the film, using the same actors and filming a little bit each year sounded like a great premise and already being a fan of Richard Linklater's body of work, I was highly anticipating this film. While, I am a fair bit older than the character of Mason, in the film, I think that it did not matter and the interesting thing about the film was I could often relate to Mason's childhood and the things that one goes through during adolescence and up to the time of being a young adult. Mason, like any of us has certainly good memories and as with the rest of us, memories that are more painful and difficult, but as with any of us, we got through them and just realized that they were par for the course in one's growing up and maturing and ultimately life itself. I really appreciated real life events being incorporated into the film's background as well and having lived through all those events it was fascinating to revisit them and also a slice of déjà vu. One would think that a film like this could be fairly stereotypical and depict the type of American family that one sees in such films set during 1950s America, where everything is prim, proper and stereotyped to the point that whenever we see a film like that we immediately know it was right out of that time frame. Boyhood, has a more modern and what I would call a more realistic approach by showing these characters as real people who have flaws, sometimes struggle with things and overall aren't perfect human beings. We see them warts and all here and we like these characters and the filmmakers for doing it in this way because it is more believable and so much easier to relate and connect to. While all of our life stories growing up will be slightly different there are bound to be elements that is in each and every childhood and I think Linklater and his cast captured the altogether feel and emotions of growing up and dealing with and relating to everyday issues as well as what is going on in the background as well. All the professional actors such as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are excellent here and we gain a lot of respect for these two characters during the film, not because they would win a parent of the year award, or anything like that, but because they really do care for these kids and yes they make mistakes and acts of poor judgment, but at the same time they will do anything for their kids and they are everyday parents who we can relate and connect to, for some probably in more ways than one. The acting from them as well as all the newcomers here is all fantastic. The performances all feel so real and natural that at times the film feels as if you are watching a documentary rather than a fictional film. The performances and Linklater's knack for dialogue and just capturing your everyday person is all fantastic here and makes it seem like cinema verite, or a documentary even though we know it is not. I think the first part of the film before Mason hits high school is what most connected and fascinated me about the film, but I think as I mentioned above that upon second viewing I could eventually grow to love the second half just as much. Not that it was not interesting, but I just found at times I couldn't relate to the post high school and early college years quite as much and that at times those scenes maybe did drag a little bit, but I understand that they were necessary for the film and I think a second viewing would make me sit up and appreciate said scenes even more than I did on so far what is a first and only viewing. Boyhood, is one of the best reviewed films of the year and for obvious reasons. I would say that if you have a chance to see it on the big screen than I would highly recommend it. A film of this natural and haunting beauty and realism is a real milestone and deserves to be seen (perhaps multiple times) and appreciated. Highly recommended viewing."
BOYHOOD,14 July 2014,8/10,"Richard Linklater writes outstanding dialogue. In nearly three hours there is an abundance of dialogue. At the point of the girl on the bicycle walk and talk scene, things begin to feel long. There are redundant car interior locations for many conversations.The same cast for twelve years of shooting gives this movie a gimmick that works. Ellar Coltrane is great growing up in the lead role. Ethan Hawke adds a shot in the arm every time his character is on screen. Patricia Arquette marries jerks. Lorelei Linklater changes the most over the twelve years of production. She goes from a scene stealer early to an I'm bored with this project attitude. There is a very good use of music. Some subtle touches indicate time passing, as well as unsubtle hair cuts. Seems like there would have been little league baseball or scouts but those weren't the choices of where to dip the tea bag of this boy's life. Like the grass on the poster shot, some things seem artificial or forced. A couple of political views expressed ring Hollywood and not Texas where the action is taking place. Bush bashing seems out of place in the state that elected a Bush Governor and two generations of Presidents.It's a small movie that plays well on the big screen. It's an intriguing, captivating movie experience. To avoid distractions enjoy it in a theater."
BOYHOOD,10 February 2015,6/10,"Richard Linklater's ""12 Year Project"" is an interesting experiment as we watch a boy grow up from 6 to 18 years old. Shot in real time, we not only see the main character, Mason Jr. (and the actor portraying him), grow up over 12 years, but we also see his sister, his Mom and Dad (and the actor's playing them) grow up as well. It is an ambitious project and an ambitious experiment that has been pulled off.It also is incredibly boring.NOTHING HAPPENS. That's my biggest critique of BOYHOOD. We see vignettes of Mason Jr's life, but - besides some scenes with Mason's Mom - nothing really happens. Now, one will argue that this makes the movie ""real"", but I will counter with it doesn't make it interesting.The acting is strong - for what they have to do. This is why I think that Patricia Arquette is my choice for the Oscar for Best Support Actress. Throughout this 2 hour and 45 minute film of somewhat curious nothing, she has things happen to her and she needs to act - and react - to those moments. It was a welcome bit of emotion in a movie that is pretty even keel.I applaud Linklater, his cast, the crew and the studio that financed this ""experiment"". Linklater pulls off the feat subtly. You don't know that he is pulling off an experiment (unlike BIRDMAN where all I could see WAS the experiment). It is an intriguing project. I just wish it was a more interesting movie.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
BOYHOOD,15 August 2015,9/10,"If you're unfamiliar with the name Richard Linklater, then you're in for a real treat. Linklater is a Texas filmmaker who is known for making iconic movies in and around Austin and Dallas, Texas. His films include 'Slacker', 'School of Rock', the 'Before' series, 'Bernie', and the iconic and legendary piece of cinema 'Dazed and Confused'. But nothing could have prepared us for his newest film called 'Boyhood', which is a cinematic milestone and achievement and something that will be talked about and praised for many years to come.And I'm quite sure that this will be nominated for Oscars, specifically Best Picture, but I think that it deserves its own special category and award at the Oscars. It stands out that much and is that good. You've probably seen the story of 'Boyhood' a hundred times before on television and on the big screen. We've all seen families and kids grow up, grow apart, go through difficult times, have their first kiss, going off to school, and even having your first beer.But it's how Linklater told this story of growing up that is so unique. Linklater filmed the movie in under two months over a twelve year period between 2002 and 2013, using the same actors sporadically for a day or two here and there over the twelve years. We see them, especially the kids grow from early grade school through going off to college. It's quite impressive and very magical to say the least.It reminded me a little bit of Terrence Malick's film 'Tree of Life', where we saw a family go through the key moments of life. We get that essence with 'Boyhood', but on a very subtle level and no matter if you are eight years old or in your late 50s you will for sure relate to the characters and remember doing some of the things growing up in your own family.But where others have taken a whole season to do or a long documentary to tell a tale, Linklater told a perfectly cohesive and realistic story in a narrative film, using the same actors for twelve years, which is a feat to say the least. We see the emotional and physical changes of each character throughout and how they grow into who they became now. The two big actors throughout the film are Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who play Mason Sr. and Olivia.They are divorced parents with two young kids who mature over the course of the film. The young kids are Ellar Coltrane (Mason Jr.) and Lorelei Linklater (Samantha and Linklater's real life daughter). 'Boyhood' is told through the eyes of Mason Jr. and we see Ellar at a very young age as a very cute kid who grows up to a be a kind, quiet, thoughtful, good looking young man on his way to college. The same thing goes for his sister Samantha, who is a more blunt, in-your-face rebellious teenage girl.Although it is never revealed why Mason Sr. and Olivia got divorced, you can come to a conclusion is was because they were extremely young and Mason Sr. wasn't ready to be a father. Although you can tell that he is always wanting to be around his kids and is a decent father, although he isn't around too much.Meanwhile, Olivia moves to Houston where her kids start a new school, which seems to happen a lot over the course of the film, because she marries two seemingly good men, who turn into violent abusive fathers. But like Ellar says in the movie, ""It's the little moments that make life worthwhile."" And that is the key to this film and Linklater showed us the precious moments of happiness, disappointment, tragedy, love, and loss perfectly.Whether it be seeing the kids stand in line in costume for a past 'Harry Potter' book, going to see your first concert, that iconic conversation between father and son about 'Star Wars', the first awkward talk about sex, or how to be a good person to other people, it's all her in 'Boyhood', and each actor plays it flawlessly. Or at least as flawlessly as they could, considering it taking twelve years to make, while going through childhood, puberty, and your teenage years.With 'Boyhood', it's not about what happens in the film, it's about the journey. The journey of a family who has matured and grown through thick and thin. The end result is very fulfilling and it will leave you wanting to spend more time with the characters, or at least check in with them from time to time over the next twelve years. 'Boyhood' is a must-see for everyone."
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,9/10,"I watched many films in my life, but only few left such a stamp on me. This is one of those. I am not sure why, was it because it reminded me on my boys growing up, or because it touched at the meaning of life, it passage and inevitable reproduction of it, and then THE END of it.I really could write many lines of praise about it, but I will not. I will just watch the Oscar night of 2015 and see it take many Oscars. I wish I could give it 10 out of 10 grade, but I can not. Only one film I graded with that grade, and I simply will not deviate from that rule, although in this case I should. P.S. Why he hated squash? Jennifer really made great one! I really loved it. I am sorry our time passed too, and our kids are grown now. It was inevitable. But why? I do not expect you to answer that question. No one really can. Mother Earth is simply revolving around the Sun and itself, and there is no way in stopping it."
BOYHOOD,2 March 2020,7/10,"I can respect what the movie is and stands for. the movie seems a little unsure of its direction, but in my opinion the story does have an arc. you can give a lot of credit for its production and affort that went into the representation of the timeline, but to me that is not the most important thing when it comes to movies that i like. still this is on of the better movies when it comes to movies that arent really for me.7/10: actually pretty pog"
BOYHOOD,4 September 2014,8/10,"Boyhood is an observant and sometimes profound marriage between fiction and reality. Individual growth is one of the most prominent and arguably over-used themes in Hollywood films because it is an expression of the freedom that people have living in a democratic society. Boyhood reinvigorates this thematic and ideological content by presenting it to us in a way we have never seen before. The director Richard Linklater filmed the same actors on screen for twelve years, tracing the life of a young boy from the age of six till he is eighteen along with his family including his parents and sister. We do not see a pre-planned character arc of development but real life and real physical development unfolding on the screen before our eyes. While adolescence and maturity have been thematic staples of many of Linklater's films, navigating seamlessly between mainstream films (School of Rock) and independent features (the Before trilogy), Boyhood combines the director's two film markets. The film is the relationship between a large, sweeping pastiche of nostalgia and cinematic memories for mainstream audiences, countered with an indie-like critique of the mental stasis faced by young adults and their parents as they grow older but fail to develop in their personal lives. It is not the director's best or most even film, a degree of patchiness was inevitable in the way it was written and filmed, but the meaning Boyhood gathers ensures it outgrows any gimmicks to offer questions about whether life is progressive or merely circulatory as repeated situations and challenges test our character and maturity."
BOYHOOD,16 November 2014,,"Like I'd stated about 'interstellar', this one too, is not just a movie, it's an experience. In some other maker's hands, this would perhaps have been gimmicky, since they used the same actors over a span of 10 years, and part- planned, part-improvised the events in the screenplay over that time. Particia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, who are really, really good here, lend the gravitas that perhaps might not have come across with other actors inhabiting those roles. Ethan Hawke especially, seems to have some kind of shorthand with Linklater where he's a part of multiple similar projects with the film-maker ('Before Sunrise' / 'Before Sunset' / 'Before Midnight' series also revisiting the same characters over various time-lines, with key differences though). What was intriguing, and on reflection, perhaps even consistent, albeit clichéd, was one characters penchant for picking the wrong kind of potential life-partner, over, and over again, in spite of the kind of growth that the same character experiences over the course of time that this movies follows the leads for. Some of what occurs though, can be said to have tread the same path like a lot of other movies in this genre have done, like 'This boy's life' for one, though not to as much dramatic (read, mainstream dramatic) effect. Not to use that fact for criticism, though I'd have loved it if it had traversed some new ground. Linklater (could almost be a pun for this movie as well - heh heh) knows how to focus on story first, and he ensures that the content and the narration is what holds the movie up, while also allowing us to marvel that the end product came to fruition at all. In this, he's ably assisted by various performances (ironically, his daughter's is the only one that feels jarring in its amateurishness as the film progresses - I'd have to assume that he was responsible for allowing that, though I wonder why), esp. Coltrane's, whose expression of neutral, albeit, completely self-aware curiosity remains consistent all through, and his characterization, over the span of everything that happens to him remains as consistent as his performance.This movie doesn't feel like one, like I mentioned at the beginning, instead feeling like a piece of work that allows us, the audience, to be in the same room as the leads, and experience everything that befalls them, and look at the surroundings with their eyes, while life befalls them. That is the best kinda movie, and I found the experience remarkably as real as the ones I experienced with 'Rachel getting married' or 'Your sister's sister' and maybe, to some extent, 'Cyrus' and a few others of their ilk. I'm not even mentioning Linklater's best 'Before...' movies here, since I've touched on those already, albeit in another context. The best kind of movies do this well, IMO, and it's perhaps one of the reasons I enjoy watching movies so much, and reflecting on them afterward - their ability to transport us into another world, and making us feel like we belong. Not easy for anyone to pull off, in any kinda genre.I was also lucky in my local viewing on 3 counts: 1, for this one to have found local distribution itself. 2, for some reason, the typical anti-smoking warning that detracts from the movie-watching experience never showed up in the couple of scenes that characters did light up, and finally, 3, the audience I watched this with, other than the couple beside me, was extremely well-behaved. Not too many conversations, not answering cellular calls - keeping the movie-watching experience almost pristine. Not sure I'll get that again in my 2nd viewing, but sure hope to.So, conclusively, a fantastic watch on the big-screen, whether/not you have like-minded company. Not to be missed."
BOYHOOD,22 September 2016,7/10,"Boyhood's advertised appeal is it took 12 years to shoot so you see the actors gradually age. But this is really secondary, almost subliminal.The families break up over and over. The children have to get used to a succession of fathers, who each have wildly different parenting styles. The screenplay is very well done. It is almost as if the authors lifted the dialogue from my own childhood. There are people with quite different beliefs rubbing up against each other, e.g. bible belt Christians, atheists, pro-military Republicans with Iraq war protesters, authoritarians with people who believe in free range kids. Most of the time one side just goes silent and endures the other droning on and on unaware their audience think them crazy.The biggest weakness is characters appear, without introduction, or explanation, then disappear without ceremony. There are often a dozen characters on screen at a time. You spend a lot of time trying to sort out who they are, while the plot is marching on.The dialogue between teens is vapid and bored. In my teen years, discussions were much more passionate, coherent and excited. Rambling aimlessly and mumbling does not make for riveting theatre."
BOYHOOD,26 December 2017,9/10,"What this film lacks in plot it makes up for with poignance, realism and the passage of time. These characters grow on you and with you...Linklater's asked many questions about the meaning of life and love before, but this time the questions seemed to write themselves. Beautiful stuff."
BOYHOOD,24 July 2014,9/10,"Linklater tells us the story of Mason's boyhood in Texas in the Noughties. The clever thing about it is that Linklater shot the film over a 12-year period, using the same actors. For over two and a half hours, we watch these characters age 12 years.The result of this technique is that we come to know them and to care about them. Each member of Mason's family becomes a fully developed character who changes over the course of time, including the adults. We are intimate with this family in a way you rarely see on the screen. It was all utterly realistic, like a docudrama. We see some of the key moments in Mason's young life, but this is padded with the nitty-gritty details of family life in this place and at this time.This movie is a quietly meandering character study based heavily on dialogue — but I didn't look at my watch once. I didn't mind that much of the dialogue did not seem to further the plot. I kept expecting trauma and conflict to erupt. It does somewhat in one difficult scene; however, mostly it does not. A few traumatic events are simply bypassed, although it becomes clear to us what must have happened.(Spoiler alert.) There are no accidents, no shoot outs. That's not what this movie is about.The acting is excellent, especially Hawke.Like most modern families, Mason's family does not fit into the classic mold. Yet he has great parents and a good childhood. As he grows up, he learns important life lessons from his mother, his father and his other male and female role models. His world is filled with love, fun, entertainment, music, art, opportunity and so on. It helps that Mason develops into a remarkable young man. All of them develop into remarkable people.This movie could have been called ""Straight Boyhood"". If I have any reservations about this film, it is about a possible homophobic undercurrent. Did I just imagine that? But even if it was there, I don't think it was unrealistic.I thought this insightful, intelligent movie worked beautifully. Kudos to Linklater and all the actors involved."
BOYHOOD,2 November 2015,10/10,"I was excited for Boyhood to say the most, and I certainly was interested in watching it. I really didn't expect it to be like this though.Boyhood is one of the few movies that lacks any real plot and still manages to be amazing. The plot is simply a boy living through 12 years of his life. Sounds simple, and it is. Yet it does it so perfectly. The characters are all well-developed, of course. But they're ever- changing, which is really good to see considering people do actually change as they age. The movie is very realistic in this way, which really adds to it. Overall Boyhood is incredible. If I could I'd give it 11/10, but unfortunately I can't. It's simple and engaging, authentic and ever- changing. It's easily one of my favorite movies, only rivaled by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If you haven't seen it, then I highly recommend you do so. If you didn't like it, then that's really too bad. I cannot recommend this movie enough, go check it out."
BOYHOOD,19 August 2014,10/10,"One of the most rewarding films of the year.Happy to be seeing this. But sad that it did not release in theaters. I suppose, in a country like us, we do not value art and films. Our theater owners are not passionate enough about films that's why I suppose they do not release indie films like this in our country. Nevertheless I am super happy and have already seen this twice. For the first time yesterday night, in one-go and since morning taking breaks and understanding the conversations. Deciphering the text, subtext, context and reading between the lines. It's an awesome feeling I have now. Feel so enriched by this experience.In life, we do one thing most and that is talk the second thing we do most is sleep. Now, I am a big fan of talk and it's very tough for me to hold back myself from talking. When the talk is this good as in this film, I love this. Now, what's the talk about. A dad explains an American tradition of giving back to the nature when peeing. A dad tells his 15 year old daughter not to get pregnant with her boyfriend. A 8 year boy learns of divorce through his mom's separation. And a teenager comes to terms with life and his passion for photography and art. Finally learns that it's the moment that seizes us and we can't seize the moment by itself. These are just fresh memories I have of this film which has given me immense learnings. The taking of this film is an epic to say the least. It's a film that was shot without any story or script for 12 years. They shot like 4-5 days each year based around a conversation and the growth of the character. It follows the growth of a young boy and his family from the age of 6 to 18. The same boy is seen growing and that comes as a wonderful transformation which we see happening on screen. Never have I earlier experienced such a real transformation captured on screen. So this is one of the toughest films ever perceived and one of the finest films ever conceived. The actors do not act they just live out their lives. They play the parts as casually as we would talk to a close friend without thinking much of the consequences. Damn, that is real fun. A 5/5 for this overwhelmingly warm film that is 2 hours and 45 minutes too short and quick. It tests the patience of those who are actually uninterested in life. But for the interested ones, this is life coming alive on screen."
BOYHOOD,12 July 2014,8/10,"""Boyhood"" is an experiment in film making. It took Richard Linklater 13 years to fully make it so that he could capture Ellar Coltrane's growing up year after year.We follow the life of Mason from the age of 5 until the age of 18. In some ways he is a very typical child; his parents split when he was young and hardly saw his father until he was 8. His mother remarry, twice; both were drunks so it did not last.Mason has a quiet, on the reflective side, demeanour. He observes the grownups around him and does not allow for their downsides to affect him. Early on he develops a distaste for being organised and follow a structured schedule.He is not alone however. His sister Samantha shares the same experiences and also shaped by them. His mother is pivotal in his life. Despite all of her faults she is totally devoted to giving her children the best upbringing she can. Then of course it is dad, who might have a few loose screws in his head but he loves them unconditionally and never ceases to encourage them. No matter what direction their lives take, they always have remained a family, a unit.""Boyhood"" is an achievement in film making. Not only we experience firsthand the growing up of two special kids but as a film it flows in a velvety smooth pace that allows the audience to be fully part of it. Part drama, part biography this is a gem of a movie and as such should be watched and cherished."
BOYHOOD,5 December 2014,10/10,"Boyhood is a movie that has been filmed within twelve years. In this case, it may become a gimmick for watching a child grow over the years, but the movie obviously uses the strategy to depict the reality of growing up, putting the viewers into the perspective of the boy as he see how life changes. The movie doesn't attempt to add anything more than what it is. We just see what normal life truly is; there's good memories and there's bad ones, there's influences and troubles. Boyhood is an astounding achievement that takes us to a real lifetime journey.Some might expect for a plot where the main character is destined for something greater, but this story never compromises anything and always sticks to the real world. What makes it grander.is it's mainly about the status of growing up. As a child, all Mason could do is play and learn, and only be the spectator of his family's problems, until he slowly grows understanding what is going on and finding a new life of his own. The film doesn't take any other arc than that because it's already a powerful thing to explore. The drama also stays honest and devoid from the operatic level. Even if we are looking at someone else's life, we have to admit that there are plenty of things we could relate to this journey, from inside of the family and out.The craft is equally excellent, with director Richard Linklater valuing every single moment, deliberately defining each stages of the kid's growth and the environment around him. It also gets around to see how cultures change every single year from entertainment to politics, never letting the audience left out of the context. And decent pacing keeps the timeline actually moving. The acting is all natural, never reaches into melodrama and it works simply perfect that way.Boyhood can be described as beautiful, even though it's often bitter, but mostly because the movie portrays growing up truthfully in this rather grand depiction of life, even if it all seems ordinary. And taking it years to realize its concept on screen made the achievement even more fascinating. The brilliance of the overall film is it takes the story real simple and apart from the extraordinary world, acknowledging the imperfection of reality and embedding more humanity, and that makes for a powerful experience. If its production story is not enough, then that's absolutely fine, because the actual movie is much interesting than that. To be sure, Boyhood is just tremendous."
BOYHOOD,20 October 2014,10/10,"Boyhood is one of the most ambitious and original films in recent memory. Richard Linklater, in 2002, hired some actors and shot a short film every year for 12 years. It's the story of a boy growing up over 12 years. However, this one is all about the small moments. No car crashes. No sentimental nonsense. No explosions. No manipulative rubbish. Just a boy growing up. So how is it so darn captivating? This isn't really about the boy. It's about him, but it's also about everyone around him as they all change and mature and learn lessons about life. We see scenes from each year, but not big ones. It's like watching a life unfold and although it's only fiction, we are watching a real person grow up. Linklater's script is amazing, managing to capture an everyday life yet still show many thought provoking life lessons along the way. It's a David Lean sized epic which happens to be about one family changing and developing throughout the years. The direction is great as well, and visually the film is a triumph.As the main character, Ellar Coltrane is excellent, but he gets overshadowed by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who change just as much as he does. The highlight of the film is a camping trip when father and son bond. Boyhood is ultimately an examination on the human condition, and although it could have ended 10 minutes earlier, aside from that there really aren't many faults. Even though nothing much happens, it's still endlessly entertaining and interesting and while it's an intimate and unshowy drama, it packs more power than a Roland Emmerich explosion fest. This is probably too indie to win best picture, but it would certainly deserve to win and Boyhood is a total masterpiece. To the remaining films of 2014, good luck. This isn't even a blockbuster, but it ruled what was a very strong summer. This is a once in a lifetime type movie and one we don't see enough of. It's absolutely essential viewing and as it's a film about fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and life in general, it'll probably speak to everyone.10/10"
BOYHOOD,2 March 2015,7/10,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.2/5 starsA nice, lighthearted, coming-of-age drama. It provides some breezy entertainment, but there's certainly nothing earth-shattering about the film as is being touted. Neither the plot nor the narrative style or even the technical aspects (such as the cinematography, editing, or production design) take your breath away; quite frankly, the only path-breaking aspect of the film is the format in which it has been shot - over a period of 12 years, making it a rare experience where you see the actors playing out their characters in a situation where their age graph runs parallel to real-life, giving the film an elevated, transient quality of space and time. In that sense it's the actors who deserve the most praise for maintaining their character traits and seamlessly portraying the numerous shifts in their character arcs over such a prolonged duration.Arquette and Hawke really sink into their roles and remarkably stay true to their character arcs through the entire period over which the film was shot, bringing subtle tonal shifts and finely tuned variations in their body language as the years go by. Ellar Coltrane as the protagonist around whom the whole plot revolves does little else than walk around moping for most of the film. He's plays his character like a typical, whiny emo adolescent, with little or no regard for almost anything in life, and mouth his dialogues in a pseudo-cool mumbling tone that's extremely difficult to decipher. Whether this is the actor's or the Director's fault is a futile debate.No doubt, Director Richard Linklater also merits due credit for being the crux holding it all together, and just for being insane and courageous enough to not only embark on his innovative cerebral germ, but also realize it to its ultimate fruition. However, all things said, if you get past this sole novel feature of the movie, you're left with just another run-of-the-mill tale of a kid growing up, albeit told with a lot of sensitivity and heart."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,8/10,"After more than a century of film history, it's hard for film makers to come up with something that hasn't been done before. Richard Linklater has done just that. He's invented the time lapse feature film. Just like in those nature documentaries from the BBC, where you see a flower budding, blooming and dying in just a few seconds, we see twelve years of growing up in less than three hours. It's an open question if this is the beginning of a new genre. It could well be that the procedure to make this kind of films is so difficult and time-consuming that 'Boyhood' will remain the only time lapse film. Whatever it will be, 'Boyhood' will remain a groundbreaking movie. Of course, Linklater has been experimenting with the concept in his 'Before'-trilogy, which in fact spans 18 years. But those are three separate films, and they weren't planned as a trilogy from the start. It's one thing for a director to come up with a completely new concept of film making. But it's another to make an interesting film. The time lapse-concept could just as well be used as a nice gimmick, after all it doesn't guarantee that the resulting film will be great. But Linklater succeeds in using his newly developed concept in such an intelligent way, that the result is outstanding. It's a heartfelt story about a boy growing up, about his parents trying to raise him in the best possible way, about making mistakes and learning from them, about things going wrong and other things going well. It contains many great scenes that make you smile, and it's hard not to be touched by some events. Maybe there is a bit too much stuff about being decisive and having to know what you want to be, but that hardly matters. Everything is perfectly measured out so that all the fragments, filmed in short periods during twelve different years, become one fluent story without sudden jumps. For Europeans like me, 'Boyhood' also gives an interesting insight in the American family life, including all those things that look so strange from our side of the Atlantic. Like letting school kids pledge allegiance to the flag - not only to the star-spangled banner, but also to the Texas flag. Or giving shotguns as a birthday present to kids who just turned fifteen, and learning them how to shoot with it. Or wearing purple robes when you graduate from high school. 'Boyhood' is going to be a classic, and it's one of the most remarkable films of 2014."
BOYHOOD,21 July 2014,9/10,"You have not seen a film quite like Boyhood.There will be copies, there will be other attempts to achieve what Richard Linklater has blown us away with, but they will remain copies, shadows of a near flawless film that adds context to one's day and necessitates a long, contemplative evening walk alone afterwards.Do you remember me urging you, last year, to take the plunge and see The Kings of Summer? I'm going to suggest now that you find a cool, summer Sunday and savour a three-course meal of The Kings of Summer as the starter, Into the Wild as your main course and Boyhood as desert and cheese & biscuits! Shot over twelve years, Boyhood is a unique filmic experience that doesn't merely depict the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his family as they move, fight, laugh, cry and love, it shows us. Linklater's casting nightmare was not matching actors to resemble each other in different stages of life, but finding four actors who would commit to a twelve-year project and, in the case of Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (as Mason's sister, Samantha), would evolve from engaging child actors to adults who could hold their own against the established adult leads.Think about the risks Linklater took. What if Coltrane couldn't act? What if one of them walked off the film (as Lorelei wanted to in the middle years – writer/director/dad, Linklater, refused)? What if one of them died? What if, what if? Frequently films and directors are referred to as 'courageous', but rarely do they deserve that accolade. Here, perhaps, Linklater and Boyhood do.Boyhood isn't about anything. It just is. Linklater rubs away the dust on the glass and allows us to look through the window at a family dealing with the business of life. Dad (Ethan Hawke), has been absent for years, a wastrel who couldn't take the responsibility of fatherhood; Mom (Patricia Arquette) is the single mother who is desperate, panicky, fearless, angry and determined to do the best with the hand life has dealt her and the appalling choices in men she is incapable of avoiding; Samantha is the older sister contending with her own adolescence, a mother who is trying to be a father, too, and a kid brother who is all kinds of annoying to a girl finding her own way.Central to it all, is Mason, the awkward kid, the thinker, morose, quirky, creative, stubborn. The daydreamer who may not amount to much if his teachers are correct, but has more to offer the world than a staffroom filled with jaded teachers. Mason, like Into the Wild's Chris McCandless, inspires us to take a look at our own lives and stances and leaves us longing for a time machine to amend our choices or do it all over again. It is a performance from Coltrane that is laidback and emotionally gripping in its portrayal of awkwardness and insightful observance of life around him. Frequently he says little, but the eyes have it. Wonderful! At some point during Boyhood, we feel we are no longer peering though the glass but have been welcomed inside and Mason's family have become our own. There are no jagged edges, no need for explanations or a filling in of the gaps. Time passes, life evolves and sometimes we don't need to know everything. It flows, it meanders; the destination may or may not be reached but what a journey! Though Boyhood is a beautiful and tender film, Linklater has not shied away from the barbs of life. He sees no need for the noisy tragedies that mar some lives, but the quiet jabs in the side from sharpened blades makes this a very, very real experience that brings gulps and sharp intakes of breath in sympathy or from personal memory. Rarely does a haircut cause an observer so much pain.Boyhood is a political film filled with social comment and Linklater's playfulness is sprinkled throughout. In a scene of father and children bonding, Dad urges Mason to steal a McCain election banner while staking the neighbourhood with their own Obama signs. In another scene the absurdity of religion is winked at when two gifts completely at odds with each other are given by the same grandparents without a hint of irony. No apology here to those who don't see the absurdity of their action.My initial feeling of Boyhood having been a near-perfect film, wavered overnight due to the occasional scenes when the acting feels a little stilted. Then I sat down to write this review, put Family of the Year's Hero on the stereo (on repeat) as my accompaniment and the emotions of last night's viewing experience rose in the form of a lump in my throat and eyes that threatened to dampen. Hero plays for barely three minutes of Boyhood but, like Eddie Vedder's Rise from Into the Wild, it sums up the experience and will for evermore be synonymous with a remarkable film, a peerless achievement from Linklater.Boyhood is a film to live with, to contemplate and revisit. It is funny and saddening, it is thought provoking and it is truthful. Stop what you are doing, switch off the world and spend some quality time with Mason and his family.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
BOYHOOD,1 November 2018,7/10,"While it never feels like it coalesces into the awe- inspiring moments it has the potential for, Linklater makes each scene interesting and valuable to the overall film. It does add another layer to the film to have it filmed over 12 years and really have each character develop over time - we really saw Mason grow up, and it makes us feel much more connected to him. The performances are all excellent, especially Arquette's. Boyhood isn't the type of movie that focuses on a specific idea or theme that makes it successful, and instead is an observation on what a fairly regular American life is like, and the questions it raises are all broad questions about growing up. I didn't finish the movie with any specific element that amazed me, and there weren't individual scenes that did either, but the cumulative effect of each scene adding to the characters coupled with the development going on with each character makes it an extremely fun movie to watch. To me, it's not the groundbreaking, movie of the decade as many critics believe, but it is a very different, carefully made movie that's good on its own merits but really worth a watch due to the unique long scale of development that makes the coming of age so much more potent."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2016,6/10,"There will never again be a movie like this, only for the reason that it couldn't generate any kind of money without being made in a unique and marketable way. Basically, it's a the greatest moments of a reality TV show about growing up. It does accomplish it's goal of realism, perhaps too well. There is no real point or theme aside from celebrating childhood in a very truthful way. We get no thru line or most of the traditional story elements that we are used to in narrative. At first, the idea of using the same actors for all twelve years sounded revolutionary, but after thinking about it I realized that you could have done that by making a bunch of home videos and pasting them together.Unfortunately, the movie got boring after about 110 minutes, and then continued for almost another hour. The disconnectedness of the scenes, while realistic, was dissatisfying because some of them just existed as their own entity and didn't contribute to any other scenes. The parts involving the first step-dad felt the most relevant. I think the main reason that there wasn't much of a point to it was because Mason didn't have any goals. I've never been a fan of passive protagonists because they don't give me a reason to root for them, and Mason was no exception. There was not one scene where he made any decisions. He just existed.The acting was decent. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette were good, but Arquette didn't deserve to win the Oscar she did. The kids were okay. Mason's acting was flat during middle school, and Samantha's took a slight decline during her college years. There was very little music to add emotion, which might be refreshing to some. The script was very true to life; whatever else you say about the movie, you can't make an argument that the lines were too ""written"".If you're going to watch it, try to do it in one sitting. If you stop part of the way through, there probably won't be much to keep you wanting to know what happens next. Don't let anyone tell you that this is a must-see. It might be poignant or emotional, but if not, you won't get much out of it. The only valuable thing that I took from it was that if life is boring, than I need to make mine interesting. It's fine to watch on your own, but I would recommend seeing it with a group so that you can have some good discussion afterward. Overall Rating- 7.2/10."
BOYHOOD,9 July 2014,10/10,"Every once in a while, you can witness something that hits you at your very core. I've felt this very few times in my film loving career. I gazed in awe at the sight of dinosaurs in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, marveled witnessing the birth of the universe in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, and now, I sit in sheer admiration and respect at the magic that is Richard Linklater's Boyhood. Nothing you have read, heard, or seen about the film will prepare you for the experience that is this cinematic rarity. Filmed over twelve years, Boyhood tells the story of Mason, who we follow from ages 5 to 18. Starring Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Lorelei Linklater, Boyhood assembles the finest cast of 2014 so far. Each player, dedicating themselves to the greater cause, allows themselves to evolve. Fully realized, and oozed with every rich element of movie making, Linklater writes the most authentic characters to grace the screens in years. Ready for more hyperbolic thoughts? Doesn't make it less true but get ready. Boyhood, potentially, could be one of the best films ever made. Last year, I referred to his third installment of the Before series, ""a masterpiece."" I stand by that even today. Boyhood however, is something that is a once in a lifetime endeavor that will be studied, criticized, admired, and bring all the discussions about film to the forefront. I feel blessed just to have watched it.Ellar Coltrane is simply stupendous. As you watch his transformation before your eyes, his subtle and restrained performance will floor you, scene after scene, year after year. It's astounding how Coltrane interprets young Mason as a boy, bringing him through adolescence with grace, and then fully realizes what kind of man he has become. There's an intimacy in which Coltrane decides to finesse Mason upon the audience. He thoroughly cares about him, understanding his confusions, and even more, realizing his flaws. It's one of the year's most outstanding performances and one of the best delivered by any child actor.Ethan Hawke continues to be one of the more undervalued and underutilized actors working today. Though he has three Oscar nominations to his name, two for co-writing Before Sunset and Before Midnight, and one for Best Supporting Actor in Antoine Fuqua's Training Day, I'm still unsure about how Hollywood and the world perceives his abilities. As Mason's Dad, Hawke takes his character to the brink of sheer brilliance. Showcasing an unrestrained and eager willingness to connect with his children, Dad, as he's only called in the film, is a sensational and intriguing look into fatherhood and being human. Chasing the dreams, and believing you are destined for something greater, Dad allows the audience to relish in his quest to be connected and complacent. Hawke shines once again, involving both mind and spirit, into a man we may know all too well.As Mom, Patricia Arquette ignites the spirit in a performance that should land her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Headlining a career that has produced impressive work on TV's ""Medium,"" as well as in films like True Romance, Arquette's prowess is her ability to be a fallen character without requiring pity or persuasion from the viewer. She interprets a woman, desperate for a connection to other aspects of her life, and reinvents the foundation of the broken mother. Arquette's beautiful yet exhilarating turn often feels like riding on the edge of a cliff, unsure if we're going in, but even more excited just to be on the ride with her. Pure and raw talent exists in her, and it's been worth the wait to finally witness it all unravel.Richard Linklater casts his daughter Lorelei Linklater to play Samantha, Mason's older sister. Without even realizing or thinking about it, you secretly and solemnly fall in love with her transformation from girl to woman. She is every bit as brilliant as any person in the cast, delivering on all beats, allowing her awkward yet sweet demeanor to pierce through yet not forgetting her annoyance and overbearing nature in which she came. Honestly, it's a performance destined to be forgotten during the awards year but it's something I will recall for years to come.There are other supporting players that we meet throughout the journey particularly Marco Perella and Zoe Graham, who completely make their mark during the picture.Running at 165 minutes, this dramatic, coming-of-age epic had me just yearning for more. I wanted to stay with them, see their journeys continue, and just relish in this dream a bit longer. I walked out secretly (or not so secretly) wishing that Linklater is quietly filming these same characters for the next twelve years, and will not reveal the plans until it's all finished. Talk about the surprise of my life. At 42 years old when and if that happens, I will be excited for the ride. Shot gorgeously by Lee Daniel and Shane F. Kelly, and edited with clarity and love by Sandra Adair, Boyhood succeeds as a technical marvel just as much as a narrative and performance piece. Linklater's writing, on virtually every level, is the best thing since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Originality, and taking a fresh perspective on a genre that could feel stale for some, Linklater will make you a believer again. His direction is even more impressive. It's the single best thing that he's ever done and probably ever will do. It's the pinnacle of his career, and is his offering to cinema for all-time.In essence, Linklater's Boyhood is a must-see film for any lover of the movies. It's the type of film that was imagined when they invented film. With tears in my eyes, I marveled and wept for a creation I still may not fully understand but am anxiously waiting to revisit very soon.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"
BOYHOOD,8 January 2015,,"This movie is fairly entertaining and well acted all the way through, but its novelty wears thin pretty quickly. I have a feeling that the critics who lavish praise on it now will have forgotten it in ten years, sort of like Crash. Remember that one, the critics' darling a decade ago, the 2004 Best Picture Oscar winner? Me neither.Boyhood has gotten a lot of attention for the novel way it was filmed, but that alone isn't enough to make it an eternal classic. It's really nothing but a fictional documentary about one kid's growing up.It's too long (almost three hours) and very repetitive, sort of like watching the kid experience the same experiences over and over at various different ages - Mom marries a jerk, kid plays the latest video game, Dad comes and goes, Mom marries another jerk, kid plays the LATEST video game, Dad comes and goes, etc, etc. Etc.It's worth watching once, maybe, just so you can say you saw it. Otherwise it's a home movie for the actors to show their grandchildren that we have to pay to watch."
BOYHOOD,10 October 2014,7/10,"12 year's in the making and it paid off. Boyhood is about the life of Mason as he ages from 5 to 18. This is a movie that started back in the summer 2002. So that mean's you get to see a young Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, and as the movie goes along you get to see them age and how much there truly change. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job as there characters. The writing in the movie is one of the best writing that I have ever seen in a while. Ellar Coltrane the main star of the film started off like child actors normally start off, a bit shallow and just there, but when got the teenager he did got better a acting and he was good in the movie. It's not a re-watchable if I have to be honest. But it's still outstanding film."
BOYHOOD,1 September 2015,7/10,"I got around to seeing this past year's winner for Best Supporting Actress Oscar (Patricia Arquette), and while I had not been terribly excited to see this- I really enjoyed this movie. I saw a documentary about director Richard Linklater awhile back, and it showed what an indie spirited, experimental filmmaker the guy is, dabbling with just about every genre, film making style, camera type, etc... This movie was shot over the course of twelve years, beginning in 2001 I think-?? Ellar Coltrane is really good as the titular subject, but at it's heart is the story of a family, particularly a divorced one, and the various relationships, marriages, etc.. the parents (Arquette and Linklater regular Ethan Hawke) go through. It was funny- I could always tell there is another year gone by, by looking at their changes in hairstyles. LOL. And I noticed Arquette began and wrapped the series ""Medium"" all within this film's duration-?? I will say, however, that the first half of the movie was much more interesting/explosive, while near about the last third things kinda dragged on-?? And you kinda notice too, since this the shooting on this movie was intermittent, that the actors don't always seem to connect their emotions-?? It would be a tough thing to pull off. Interesting then I read at Wikipedia that the last part of the movie was the most scripted-?? I also read Ethan Hawke stated the most ad-libbed part of the movie was the scene with him and son discussing whether or not there would ever be a new ""Star Wars"" film-?? LOL And by the way, I looked up who that musician roommate of Hawke's character is- none other than 1980s one-hit-wonder sensation Charlie Sexton-??! WTF! LOL Anyone remember ""Beat's So Lonely""-?? Well, overall, I would give this a definite recommend for a bold filmmaking experiment- just be warned you'll need some time to get through this- it comes in at about 2 hours, 45 minutes!"
BOYHOOD,28 January 2015,8/10,"Boyhood took fifteen years in the making and follows the life of a boy, Mason (Ellar Coltrane) as he grows into a man. The movie also examines the complexity of growing up in a divorced home and balancing the affection of both parents as they grow and evolve. It is interesting to notice the aging of the actors and an accurate cultural icon reference from the early nineties to the present. At one point I thought it was one big long commercial for Apple computers as their products are well represented throughout the film. This movie is directed by Richard Linklater and has been nominated for an Oscar in the Best Picture category."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,9/10,"Nostalgic but current; sentimental but authentic; novel but familiar – these are all conflicting but truthful ways to describe the completely original creation of writer/director Richard Linklater's Boyhood.Boyhood is the story of a boy over the course of twelve years as he reaches adulthood, uniquely told completely in real time. The refreshingly new result is a cohesive, groundbreaking, beautiful yet commonplace story to follow. The film begins with Mason at age 6, newly in school and a recent child of divorce, primarily with his mother and sister Samantha while his father visits on weekends. What follows is what can only be described as life.You can't really talk about the details of the movie Boyhood without ruining the narrative and experience for the audience. The fact that anyone would attempt to make a comprehensive movie over the course of twelve years is mind boggling. The fact that the result is a well told chronicle with a unified plot is astounding. I was curious how the story would formulate, assuming the first few scenes would be the most concrete plot and as time went on it would get increasingly muddled. That is not the case, Linklater clearly thought of every detail when writing the tale and this is evident in tiny details sprinkled about the film – cues of character development and progression only clear at the movie's resolution.It's a bit surreal to be watching a movie so clearly told in the present tense in its entirety while having bouts of nostalgia – specific examples can be cited as a child genuinely singing Britney Spears' Oops I Did It Again or seeing a man smoking inside a restaurant with his kids. A lot can change in twelve years and yet seems subtly insignificant in the day-to-day.Each noticeable transition signifying a time lapse and further years passing always seemed too soon. I was not done with that part and wanted a few scenes more from the story – that being said of a movie two hours and forty-five minutes long. Linklater was incredibly smart to use politics, hair changes, music (and what a glorious soundtrack it has!), and technology advancements to indicate time's forward progression. I also like the parallelisms of location changes; it was a nice way to show the sameness yet differences and changes occurring.I commend the actors for signing on to be a part of this mammoth undertaking. Patricia Arquette is delicate in her portrayal of the mother through these twelve years, never seeming like her personality changed too much too soon. Ethan Hawke is entertaining as the mildly rebellious father and how he transformed over time. The children are a dream, and I especially was enchanted by the actress playing Samantha, Mason's older sister. I wonder if the director allowed for flexibility within the story based on how the child actors actually grew up verses how the characters they portrayed evolved.It's depressing watching the film to see how with time changes, people change. It is equally weird how quickly you as the viewer adapt to the present and memory fades regarding the early years. The course of events might be deemed frustratingly realistic – but Linklater provides a truthful account of life, and life can be incredibly frustrating. The sentiment of time and life and the closing of the film are perfectly and satisfyingly summarized with Linklater's script writing – particularly a monologue by Patricia Arquette and the final conversation between Mason and a college classmate at the end of the movie.Boyhood is truly profound and you can tell this is a project that is dear to Richard Linklater's heart and he accomplishes a feat in film-making that will likely never happen again. I highly recommend watching this movie at least twice, you will see the tiny deliberate details that Linklater uses to foreshadow what will happen during the film – the lies we tell ourselves, the choices we make, the compromises that change us and mistakes we must live through in life.More recent movie reviews can be found on our website for Archon Cinema Reviews."
BOYHOOD,29 November 2020,,"There's a lot to admire here, mostly the performances that were apparently sustained over 10 years. Yet as an overarching view of growing up in the modern western world it falls short, possibly by trying to cover too much ground. Having said that, it's entertaining, memorable and worth watching."
BOYHOOD,25 September 2014,,"""Boyhood"" is landmark in cinematic history. Richard Linklater's ambitions cannot be discredited, and the success from those ambitions he is able to boast cannot be overlooked. But amongst every beautiful thing Linklater produces here, I can't help but think the hype of ""Boyhood"" is too heavy for a film of its size and merits, and that people will leave mildly disappointed with expectations of anything less than ""Birth of a Nation"" meets ""Citizen Kane"", meets ""The Godfather"". It's a product of dumb luck, a swift filmmaking skill, and an clear understanding of life. ""Boyhood"" uses ""method storytelling"" by filming in real time, watching the actors age into the characters, and seeing another human being evolve from days of backpacks and pencils to college textbooks and dorm supplies. Linklater strikes a manageable balance between spontaneous improvisation and scripted specificity that works for the documentary type feel he's going for.Linklater's direction is the film, mostly everything else is negligible to the final product but his burning desire to tell this story properly and realistically. When watching the film, sure, we're seeing a neatly crafted biography told on screen, but as I experienced ""Boyhood"", I couldn't help but think how personal the film must be to Linklater, suggesting he built it partially as an autobiography. I can picture Linklater's adolescent life having some strong similarities to Mason's journey. Heck, there were times feelings were so accurately and honestly conveyed in ""Boyhood"" I thought to myself, ""that's me"". I was the eight year-old kid with the divorced parents carrying a copy of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"".Having already shown eye for a more ""natural"" type of filmmaking with the ""Before"" trilogy, ""Boyhood"" lets Linklater take his talents to a new level in scope rather than just an afternoon, an evening, or a few days. And in fact, he paces the film very well. He does not investigate any particular time in Mason's life too extensively, but enough time for us to understand the ugliness of the unchangeable issues some children have to face because of their parents' selfishness and irresponsibility. Linklater snips each year or so, and ties it together giving us the basic information we need to know.The two most important performances in ""Boyhood"" come from Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the two parents, whom we always recognize through the changing years and evolving characterization. When Hawke comes on screen, which he only does in scattered portions, ""Boyhood"" bounced to higher levels of magic and enjoyment than when he is missing from the picture. He's an ace-in-the-hole and makes every second he has worth something. Arquette, who is featured more than Hawke, goes for a less impressionable approach, and while she persuaded me of this woman's pain, especially in a tearful final scene, I did not have that audience-to-character connection with her as I did Hawke.I'm not going to lie and overpraise ""Boyhood"" based on the approach it takes to storytelling. It's revelatory, but if an audience member saw ""Boyhood"" without knowing it went through such a prolonged production process, they would probably think less of the film. It's not even my favorite movie I've seen so far this year, but it's certainly an experience that should be lived. The film is a sensitively and intimately directed display of self-discovery and the mystery of growing up.* * * * / 4 stars"
BOYHOOD,2 May 2018,4/10,"Actors probably enjoyed making this more than the audience does watching it. Maybe it's Hollywood's attempt at reality TV. Novel but mostly boring. With a better script this experiment could have been great. Why are so many people down on Mason? His sister, his two step-dads, his boss. Gets repetitive. Highlights: Mason Snr's scenes in the car with the kids. In one he pulls over to insist they tell him more about their week (since he last saw them) and the second time he gives Mason Jnr a CD compilation of the Beatles' music post-breakup then gives an interesting analysis of it/them."
BOYHOOD,8 September 2014,10/10,"I've sat with the aftermath of this movie for a few days now; as will all films I want it to settle and not rush to conclusions. I've done that; now's the time to allow an opinion to take some sort of shape. It may change - in greater or smaller ways - over time and re-viewings, of course. However I need to allow something to emerge out of the haze. What emerges is simply this: it's a masterpiece. It's not much less than three hours long, but I could have watched another three hours. It's funny, sad, gripping, moving, engaging, disturbing and comforting. The acting is flawless, the direction almost miraculous, the soundtrack addictive, the dialogue real and true at the deepest levels. You may have heard about how this film has come to be: the story of a family's life, told from the viewpoint of a son, shot over the course of 12 years (think of the boggling level of vision this requires on the director's part), each year, as the actors grow up. If it sounds like a gimmick, nothing could be further from the truth. Through fracturing marriages, birthdays, rites of passage, fads and life-shaping decisions, the family's life is tracked with a compassionate eye for the little details that tell us more than a library's worth research project. Pushed to say what it's about, you'd be hard-pressed to say: other than boyhood, girlhood, motherhood and fatherhood. We all have something to see here. It's probably not perfect; some of the bit-part players seem to find hard to find the right tone of performance; occasionally you'd like to linger longer on a life-moment. Really, though, those are faults for the sake of it. Basically it's perfect, and there's not a soul that wouldn't have an enriched life for having seen it. Over the course of twelve quiet years, one of the era's definitive artistic achievements has emerged."
BOYHOOD,14 June 2015,9/10,"Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting. It's impossible to watch Mason and his family without thinking about our own journey."
BOYHOOD,6 November 2014,10/10,"Epic and exceptional are words that don't even begin to describe Boyhood – easily one of the best films of modern cinema and writer/director Richard Linklater's masterpiece. In terms of craftsmanship alone, this film is simply incomparable to anything Hollywood has produced in the last decade or perhaps even more. That's because this film is beyond the realms of make-believe or anything remotely close to Hollywood flamboyance.As an independent production there can be no better depiction of art imitating life. In its entirety this film is a beautiful but huge canvas about milestones in life including phases of inevitable ugliness, aspirations for the future, mistakes of the past, uncertainty of the present and much more. All this is derived from the film's core component and that is the devastating as well as healing properties of time. It is time that dictates everything, starting with the 12-year period it took to shoot and produce this film, while using the same actors. Linklater began filming in 2002, by painstakingly assembling a larger than life portrait of a boy destined to become a man. The opening scene is angled down on a patch of grass as six-year-old Mason (Ellar Coltrane) gazes up at the sky. We don't know what he's thinking but it's clear his mind is abuzz with the uncertainty of what lies ahead. We soon learn Mason and his sister Samantha (Linklater's daughter Lorelei in a breakout role) are products of a broken marriage. Mom (Patricia Arquette) has custody of the kids but is in and out of bad relationships. She struggles to find some sort of balance between being a single mother and her job as a college professor while frequently moving house. Dad (Ethan Hawke) is a loner who often has to drive long distances to see his kids. He is pretty much a man who is still a boy. There are moments when Dad and Mom interact, giving Mason a sliver of hope that his parents eventually reconcile their differences. Then the years go by, and over time we watch Mason and his sister literally grow up on screen.At times Boyhood resembles a sitcom without the comedy. But have you ever seen characters morph and age naturally in one sitting? Filming in sequential intervals, Linklater documents the highs and lows of growing up as we follow Mason all the way till he's 17-years-old and ready to leave the nest. We hear his voice crack, we see him sprout facial hair, we feel his warm fuzziness as he finds himself attracted to girls, and then his pain when he is heartbroken. While this is happening, we are put in Mason's perspective as his sister, mother and father go through several phases in life. There is so much happening around Mason that the film could have been titled 'Life', and it would have still worked the way it does. As such, everything that happens just feels genuine and that's largely due to Linklater's improvised and intuitive script. And even though the story is scripted, you still feel like you are watching real people go about their day-to-day lives. While you won't find timestamps to indicate years going by, the story is embedded with subtle cues like period music, the end of the Bush Administration and various other world events.Every character is developed over time and the actors portraying them are so sensational, you think you have known them your whole life. Coltrane especially is an instant standout. There are several frames of Mason just staring into space. He's a dreamer but with a stern eye for detail. When he eventually decides to become a photographer, a teacher tells him there's no scope in art. Boy is he wrong! By just watching Boyhood you become a part of cinematic history. Something like this has never been done before simply because modern art suffers from hyperbolic commercialisation often referred to as 'entertainment'. While it is still very entertaining, it is not the type of film where the makers expect to triple each dollar spent to produce it. In fact, all they spent was $4 million, that too, over a period of 11 years. It just goes to say that some of the greatest things in life are virtually free, if we only know where to look for it.2014 is already a good year for films. Boyhood just made it phenomenal by a long shot as one of the most overwhelming films ever made. Once you watch it, it stays with you, latched on somewhere deep inside. And speaking of time, its 165 minutes running time flashes in the blink of an eye – just like life."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,7/10,"""Boyhood"" is unique in many ways with a story many can relate to. As I've read, the film took 12 years in making and chronicles the growth of the real characters, which makes the film realistic and differs it from other movies. Although the title of the film is Boyhood, it doesn't just delve into the boyhood, but details on parenthood. It deals with caring for your children and fending for the family against the difficulties in life and relationships. Well, the story presented isn't very different from that you would anticipate in the family series. The film also goes for an inordinate length and seems more like a derivative of a TV series. But the presentation and the performances just make this film a treat to watch with a witty account of a family drama sequences filmed year after year.Nothing is more natural than the changing of the moods and maturing of the characters within the film. Performance wise, all give a top notch performance. Mason and Samantha both give mind blowing performances, specially when they were very young. There childhood and their gradual growth just touches you. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as dad and mom also give brilliant performances and their presence just enlivens the screen. The film has been nominated for Best Picture in Oscars and been rewarded the Golden Globe for Best Drama. Concerning the simple story it derives, it seems Oscars won't reward it for Best Picture. But performance wise, I feel Ethan Hawke will go home this time with a statuette for the Best Supporting Actor.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"
BOYHOOD,5 July 2018,4/10,"Just when I thought this was another chronicle of Godless people living without a code, they threw in some worthwhile scenes with coded adults. A photography teacher, a corrections officer, a restaurant employer, a girlfriend, and a reformed dad all tried to teach our apathetic protagonist some valuable life lessons. Those were great scenes. They had to throw in some political propaganda against President Bush, for Obama and singer ""Bright Eyes,"" to appease their stars or themselves I imagine. At least they showed religious people as sincere and kind before they gently mocked the concept.Something this long starts to feel self-indulgent. But most scenes are thoughtful and carefully made. I'll give it a grudging recommendation."
BOYHOOD,13 November 2014,7/10,"6.75 of 10. Besides being too long and making some character/casting mistakes that are typical of films centered on young people, it does do several critical things in drawing you in and keeping your interest. The story feels real from the start and you want to see what happens with the characters and where the story is going.The film never stops shifting, sometimes too often, but once the pattern is developed, it becomes an expected part of the film and something you can look forward to. It gives you a much more expanded cast of characters as a result and embeds one of the aspects/difficulties of being in a family that moves often.As a whole, it's boy, mom, and sisterhood, something for the whole family."
BOYHOOD,28 April 2017,2/10,"This is a good idea for a film: using the same cast, filming parts each year for twelve years. It won loads of awards, and critics love it - so I was expecting it to be great. I was very disappointed to see that it's slow, boring and far too long."
BOYHOOD,9 February 2015,7/10,"If, as expected, Boyhood wins Best Motion Picture of the Year at the Oscars later this month it will be at the expense of better films.It's a low budget, 'indie' movie and has a strong feeling of the pet project about it, yet it's risen to astonishing heights since its debut at the Sundance Film Festival last year.And in an Oscar year where perhaps more than ever before the best movie nominations are dominated by art-house films – Birdman, Whiplash, Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything must all fall into that category – it's the one that's picking up the big prizes. (Golden Globes and BAFTAs are already in the bag.) But Birdman, Whiplash and Grand Budapest Hotel are all, for my money, vastly superior creations.If you haven't seen it, and that's entirely possible because it came and went in the blink of an eye – not troubling the schedulers in your local multiplex, it's a truly original piece of filmmaking. Shot over 12 years it tracks the growing up of five-year old Texan boy, Mason, right through to his High School graduation. Along the way his mother (played brilliantly and actually the real grit at the heart of this movie) by Patricia Arquette works her way through a series of unfortunate relationships and marriages. With a minimum of fuss the movie shows the whole family (Mason's estranged father, Ethan Hawke, his mother and sister) visibly age on screen as they traverse all that life throws at them.But the truth is it has divided its audience with many suggesting it's actually just plain boring; lacking, as it does, any conventional sense of plot. I wouldn't personally go that far as I found it absorbing, only outstaying its welcome inn the final reel, but it's just not as good as its reputation.Sure, it's impossible to argue with the sheer ambition of making a movie over 12 years but once you're into it it's not THAT incredible. Mason, for a start is not developed as a character greatly and the only real 'performances' as such are from Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke who, to be fair, are both excellent.But if I were giving out the Oscars I'm not sure this would even make the shortlist. For me it would be a straight shoot out between Birdman and Whiplash with Birdman just edging it for its sheer originality."
BOYHOOD,25 October 2014,9/10,"An achievement of epic scope, some of the best filmaking of the 2000s. An experience that will be most certainly remembered by the people who will see it. This movie is a jem of cinema.The really amazing feat that Linklater managed o to pull of is the seamlessness of this growth. It is a long movie, rightly so, and does not feel in any way, shape or form that long. It flows so perfectly from start to finish that you really don't realize you are watching a movie. True story: at about two thirds of the movie I was taken out of it for a couple of seconds and in that moment I realized I was looking at something on screen, it was such an amazing feeling. Because of this you never are really thinking about anything but the movie and when I came out of it, it took me a couple of hours to process what I had seen and it wasn't until I thought and re-thought about it that I realized how good it actually was. I was trying to think if their were weak spots, but there simply weren't, every scene that came back to my head was amazing. Obviously behind this magic stand fantastic performances across the board, excellent writing and gorgeous photography. There are some long takes that follow simply characters talking and they are truly immersive and beautiful. I also love how the movie addresses the pop culture elements contemporary to it. The scenes regarding Harry Potter or The Dark Knight mentioning or the Star Wars discussions, they were a perfect icing on the cake. Moreover the perspective that the movie offers on the human condition is very deep and gives a great cue of thought. Lets just talk a second about the ending. Boy oh boy! What a perfect, spot on, incredible conclusion! There are so many ways the ending could have failed, but wow it did it perfectly and could not have been any better.I do think unfortunately that the movie has a problem and it made me feel some distance from it at times. I don't regard Mason's character as being really that well defined. He falls into being slightly generic in some aspects. By the end I learned a lot of things about him, but couldn't really round out his characteristics. I think this is because the film doesn't look at the various aspects of a boy's life in equal measure. There is a bit too much family and a little too much of the fun aspect of a teenager's life, the school, the friends, the girls. It just has a poke at these aspects, but we never truly understand what is going on in Mason's life outside of his family life. Anyways, the movie is cinema at its core, it is a great experiment and I can't recommend it enough. One of year's best."
BOYHOOD,6 May 2017,9/10,"Amongst many aspects of the cinema, one of them is to be a window into life, and few movies in the cinema can do it as perfectly as boyhood, with its bold idea of ​​being recorded for 12 years, he succeeds in simply portraying life, with All your choices, mistakes, hits, dramas, loves, disappointments, disappointments and hope. Simply telling the story of a mother and her two children, the plot goes through the mother's unsuccessful marriages, the search for the biological father's surrender, the search for dreams, the evolution, stagnation and involution of our characters. The script is not megalomaniac, it is not complex and not full of twists, of course we have many narrative mirrors, and even some easter egg director does, but in essence it is simply portraying the footsteps of a boy, from childhood to youth , Its clarity and simplicity cause perfection in portraying all the subtleties of life, reminiscent of the recent ""Manchester by the sea"", and even the controversial ""Blue is the warmest color"", ""Boyhood"" is almost an epic, an epic Of real life. With a moral that undergoes a message that ""everything has its right time in life"", it is a beautiful message, which the film legitimates, but in a completely natural way, without wishing to lecture or make judgments. With an always clear photograph and simple cameras that simply seek to show the naturalness and beauty of the common, we have a great assembly and an extraordinary pace, its almost 3 hours of duration are more for 20 minutes, alias, it is almost like spying on someone's life For 12 years, I can not fail to mention his well-honed soundtrack, which among many things, help to temporarily mark the timeline of the film, as well as convey feelings, be they the pure adventure climate to melancholy. In terms of acting we have many disasters and performances that are completely lost with the passing of the film, after all, we can not forget that the actors of the work recorded it for twelve years, but we have to mention the actor Ellar Coltrane, who during the twelve years makes An incredible performance (a pity that we will see the actor in his junior phase only in this work), it is worth mentioning also to Etha Hawke that manages to give a perfect evolution to his character but without losing its essence, and of course, I can not finish without speaking of Completely crazy and daring Richard Linklater, who has modeled the film for twelve years, and did a perfect job of directing, showing how simple and yet complicated life is, and how all its phases have an intrinsic beauty. ""Boyhood"" is certainly a unique film, we can not doubt that, it is incredible how Richard masterfully accomplished his goal, and since it is subtle and does not play with the viewer, many characters are evolved in intrinsic ways, with gestures that Are not highlighted on the screen, Richard manages to align the script to the rhythm perfectly and manages to show through his camera the life."
BOYHOOD,9 March 2014,9/10,Richard Linklater delivered a near masterpiece which was warmly received by a very enthusiastic audience in the Texas premiere of Boyhood at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. Linklater has done something that may have never been done before in a dramatic feature. He filmed the same fictional characters with the same actors (including 2 children) over the course of 12 years. The technical feet of maintain continuity while filming over such an extended period of time is remarkable and tribute to Linklater's genius. The film presents a fascinating and nuanced picture of how people grow and evolve over time. It is a story of the difficulties that we all face in growing up. The film is both universal and deeply ingrained with Linklater's own Texas roots. It is a very personal story as his daughter plays one of the 2 children. The audience was enthralled as they experienced the lifetimes of the characters especially young Mason played by Ellar Coltraine. In some ways it was difficult to tell where the line between the actors and the characters they played for so long began and ended. We see as the boy becomes a man and struggles with all of the challenges that that entails in the modern world. This is a unique film that has stretched the normal boundaries of the medium.
BOYHOOD,28 July 2014,8/10,"The key factor in Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" is that it relies on life as its main plot point, not just the characters and their motivations. Like life, they change as the years go by – in spirit and in goals. For young children coming of age, their youth is a turbulent time – full of raging hormones and confused emotions, questioning themselves about their place in this life – you only live once, so they say.Life never favors other people. There are others who seem to have it all and there are others who are always struggling. Mason's parents are the perfect example – they separate on amicable terms, and one seems to be more successful than the other, but then it shifts so gradually that their fates balance each other's out, making it unavoidably fair. Unpredictable, that life.So it goes with little Mason's youth. We first see him as a kid, gazing into the sky, wondering about life at an age where he is supposedly carefree. His sister with an attitude constantly teases him in a realistically annoying manner, and their single mother is struggling to find a better life for them all. Man men enter their lives, most unfortunately alcoholic and troubled. Mason, like most boys in that situation, logically seeks out advice from his father from time to time. He never really says it, but he's feeling confused and needs proper guidance.We've all been in his shoes. We were (some still are) all confused, lonely, trying to comprehend this thing call life. We were all spoilt brats with attitudes that would make our parents tear their hair off their heads. We were all their bundles of joy whenever we succeeded in something. Yet they are still human like us, and at their age are still trying to find out where life is taking them, for better or for worse. Linklater perfectly captures that essence, and spreads it out perfectly across nearly three hours of condensed life. He does the rarity - create an experimental film that sounds well enough to perform well with indie audiences, yet retain the emotional energy of classic Hollywood melodramas down to its barest, realistic form and lays it all out in front of the audience to see.That's the beauty of his film, it isn't one-sided. It ebbs and flows with the current, and surrounds the audience with its unforced, genuine emotions. I did not feel much empathy for Mason as much as I did feeling LIKE Mason as he went through this crazy, subtle adventure. I felt moved and touched with every poignant scene Mason has to go through, enlightened whenever his father gives him some advice, as bewildered as he is at life.We don't have many movies like this anymore nowadays. Few movies are willing to evoke the senses purely, both independent and mainstream – one either cops out and goes for audience sentimentality (and Oscar votes) while the other becomes pretentious fluff that thinks its art but it isn't, just an artist on a stage full of sound and fury. ""Boyhood"" is that rare gem that isn't – an incredibly beautiful film with many layers that provoke the mind and emotions, and left me feeling bittersweet with a tidal wave of nostalgia and poignancy, but ultimately left me feeling optimistic about the future.Mason's journey has been quite the ride, indeed. That this was filmed in 12 years is no easy task by itself - this is a film that speaks of our time perfectly, defining the current generation with aplomb where so many other modern filmmakers grasped. If you are, or are parents with kids who were, born within the 1990s and early 2000s, you owe it to yourself to see this film."
BOYHOOD,28 November 2020,4/10,"""Boyhood"" (2014), before I get into my review, there's just one thing I want to point out. I did enjoy this ""film"" somewhat when I first saw it. Richard Linklater, who is the writer, producer and director of this ""film"", definitely deserves credit and praise for his 12 years of hard work with making this ""movie"". That's quite a commitment and it should not go without a shoutout. It was such an ambitious undertaking with great potential and you really have to give him some serious props! If only all of that dedication was worth it in the end. Honestly, once you get past the hype of this ""film"" taking 12 years to put together, there is next to nothing salvageable at all. ""Boyhood"" has a very boring and jumbled storyline, average to stilted acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack. As for the plot, or lack thereof, it's about a boy named Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane. It shows him growing up, and that's it. I'm serious, for a ""film"" that's nearly three hours in length, very little to nothing happens. There is literally no storyline except watching a boy grow 12 years older, along with the other actors and actresses around him. Now, there are movies and shows out there with lack of plot that are much more entertaining than this. There is a right way to make a movie or TV show with a lack of plot, and ""Boyhood"" is one of the worst examples of how not to do it. Similar to one of the biggest problems with ""Jaws"" (1975), the script was incomplete when the ""film"" was green-lit. Wow, you would think after that, film makers would've learned their lesson! You can't make a movie without a completed script, or at the very least, a full draft. It goes entirely against film making protocol! Actually, what Richard Linklater did was, after each subsequent year of production, he would add on to the script for the next occurring year and tell the story as it progressed naturally. That's an interesting idea, evolving a storyline during the process of production. But, I personally think that there should have been a fully completed script before production was even close to being green-lit. As I said, it didn't have to be a final script, but it could have given this ""movie"" a more well-rounded resemblance of a plot besides just watching characters age 12 years on the screen. As for the acting, it's overall just as big a disappointment. The best performances come from Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane. They seem to be the only ones who actually appear to be trying. But, the best performance comes from Ethan Hawke as Mason Evans Sr. His energetic and positive attitude that he brings into this role really stands out and almost makes up for the lackluster supporting actors and actresses. Ellar Coltrane as Mason Evans Jr. also does a great job in this ""movie"". His acting did start off a little slow when he was younger. But, as he got older and matured, his acting gradually got better. Patricia Arquette also gives a really strong performance as Olivia, Mason's mother. She does get a little over-dramatic at times, but all-in-all, she did a decent job. Sadly, all of the other actors and actresses are just average to bad with their acting. The main characters may give the best performances in this ""film"", but the supporting characters matter too. Remember, main actors are only as good as their supporting actors. The soundtrack is a generic and cliched mess. There are a few good songs here and there, but for the most part, it's just nothing to write home about. One song in particular, is a standout amongst the others in the supposed tone of the ""film"", called: ""Hero"", by Family of the Year. That song shows that the score was on the right track, but besides that, there is hardly anything memorable in the soundtrack. Now, let's get to the positives in this ""movie"". The only two positives are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and reflect the aging time period of the plot and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are perfect. Being a movie made in 2014, that's not surprising! Great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for lackluster screenwriting and acting. ""Boyhood"" is a movie that had serious potential, however, it was ultimately just a waste of 12 years. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Before I wrap things up, I just wanted to say this one last time. The fact that Richard Linklater stayed dedicated to this production for 12 years is a huge feat in itself and he deserves credit for that. Plus, it is cool to watch the actors and actresses age naturally on-screen. There are just two crucial elements missing here though: a storyline and acting."
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,8/10,"Richard Linklater enjoys exploring the nooks and crannies of people, delving deep into his characters in a bid to uncover what makes them – what makes all of us – tick. He also really enjoys investigating the concept of time, and how it can warp and mend relationships and memories. His Before Sunrise trilogy encapsulated that beautifully: every nine years or so, his camera checks in on the same couple, to see if they're still in love, or if they've begun to float out of each other's orbit. The scope, ambition and depth of those three films, however, are dwarfed by his latest effort, a film about a boy that took him and his astonishingly dedicated cast twelve whole years to make. The result is a snapshot of a life, one that practically radiates the hope and heartbreak of being human.Boyhood opens on a six-year-old Mason (Ellar Coltrane) as he navigates a slightly bumpy road through childhood. His mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) is struggling to make ends meet after his commitment-shy dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) disappears to Alaska. He's bothered relentlessly by his elder sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter). Together – or not quite together – this family grows older, though not necessarily wiser. Mason and Samantha bond with their new step-siblings. Olivia marries again and goes back to school to earn a degree. Mason's dad goes through girlfriend after girlfriend until he meets his wife.Strictly speaking, the film has no plot – or no more plot than any of our lives do. There's plenty of incident, of course: twelve years' worth of scenes snuck out of the actors' lives and schedules. We flit from living room to driveway to diner, a collection of venues that serve as the backdrops for all the moments in these characters' lives. But these bursts of ordinary life – very few scenes thrum with the urgency typically injected into every beat of a movie – don't quite make up the kind of plot to which we're accustomed. It's why the frequently languid Boyhood can occasionally feel downright lethargic, particularly when Mason hits his teenage years and begins to grow away from his family.But where Boyhood triumphs is in its uncommon observations about what makes up not merely a childhood, but a life. There are the words adults have forgotten they said that wind up carved in a small boy's heart. There are small acts of kindness – the grudging easiness that takes ten years to grow between Mason Sr. and Olivia. And there are the tiny acts of violence committed by someone close to you: the little bursts of cruelty dealt out by Mason's stepfather (Marco Perella), as he keeps losing his daily battle with his inner demons and addictions. Through it all, you realise that – in Mason's life, as in all of our lives – there are perfectly ordinary, wonderful, hateful moments, people, words, images and ideas that make us who we are.Boyhood might have fallen apart if its cast weren't up to the task of telling a lifetime's worth of stories over twelve years. Imagine if Coltrane had turned out to be a terrible actor a few years down the road! Fortunately, Linklater draws stunningly naturalistic performances from his entire cast. Coltrane, of course, is the film's fulcrum, and he goes very credibly from the chubby, wide-eyed innocence of boyhood to the lean, tortured doubts of young adulthood. The film also features a pair of raw, beautiful performances from Hawke and Arquette: he finds the bittersweet humanity in a once deadbeat dad who still loves his kids fiercely, and she lends a little grace to Olivia's never-ending struggle to keep it all together.Perhaps the greatest testament to the power of Boyhood is the fact that you're never quite sure when – or how – something in the film will affect you. In this collection of moments, there are sharp, gentle spikes of love and loss, spread across years. They come in Olivia's search for a partner, or the slow, steady dissipation of Mason Sr.'s dreams to sing for anyone other than his own immediate family. They cluster around stories of whales and fireside chats about Star Wars. Just like the life it depicts, and life itself, Boyhood ebbs and flows, its insights and heart – its joys and tragedies – moulding themselves to each person in the audience, in each moment in time."
BOYHOOD,12 November 2018,,Review: I was torn because filming a movie over 12 years successfully is a huge accomplishment but I didn't really enjoy it. The direction and screenplay really aren't all that great. The casting and acting really aren't all that great either. All in all I would give this zero out of a possible five stars.
BOYHOOD,27 January 2015,9/10,"Linklater's K–12 epic seemed like a great idea as long as everyone was up for it—he admits that his daughter, Lorelei, quite the little camera hog at first, later got cold feet and asked to have her character, Samantha, killed off. The fact that the film was shot in twelve separately scripted installments, and RL's eternal quest for spontaneity and natural-sounding dialogue, seem to have ruled out a sustained ""story arc"" and character development in the conventional sense, which some will find refreshing, others offputting and boring. (Our two-person household was evenly split on this one.)Some early drama is provided by a series of oppressive stepfathers—there's a powerful scene where Mom bails on an abusive husband and the kids realize they're not going to be seeing their step-siblings anytime soon—but the best scenes just seem like random moments from Mason's real life, magically captured on film—at a new school, he gets chatted up by a blond girl on a bicycle who thinks, correctly, that she's spotted a fellow nonconformist who, like her, might prefer ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to ""Twilight.""Despite its 165′ running time, ""Boyhood"" only loses momentum when Mason evolves into a mouthy art guy in the final scenes; a Philip K. Dick–style monologue on the dystopian implications of Facebook brings things to a dead halt (Mason's thinking's not nearly as original as the eccentric theorists who turn up in ""Slacker"" and ""Waking Life""). Excellent work by Patricia Arquette as Mason's mother, attractive, aspirational (she makes a great college professor), but a bit self-absorbed and with a regrettable weakness for angry, controlling assholes—a fine illustration of how you can make the same mistake over and over again and still think you're doing it right. Longtime RL collaborator Ethan Hawke seems like the only possible choice for the breezy absentee dad, and of course Ellar Coltrane's relaxed, unselfconscious performance is the key to the success of Linklater's unprecedented 12-year project. PS—Watched it again and liked it even more; even Mason's ruminations on social media and the NSA seem pretty astute for a high-school kid."
BOYHOOD,26 August 2014,9/10,"Filmmaker Richard Linklater has used Ethan Hawke in all of his films, and for good reason. Hawke is one of the most natural actors working today, well proved by his ""Before"" films for Linklater. Hawke also evokes that same fine realism from the actors working with him. They were better actors in this film due to him. Too few actors deserve that honor.Boyhood was perhaps the most natural film I have seen since the last Linklater film. The dialog, the expressions, the effusive, natural joy when joy was appropriate, and the honest anger, sadness or disappointment when it was not. Spot on.There was really only one story.....a boy named Mason growing up in Texas, with all the life experiences most of us have also known, no matter where we grew up. Family, love, friendships, divorces, breakups, hardships, embarrassments, humiliations..... but also some triumphs in that mix to make it tolerable, and sometimes even great.A terrific performance from Hawke as Mason's father, and from Patricia Arquette as his mother. I expected great work from Hawke, but Arquette really surprised me with her range and naturalness.....she was totally comfortable in a difficult role to play just right, and she did it. Ellar Coltrane, a Texas boy and new actor, was effective and sometimes truly engaging as Mason. He has a lot of development left to do as an actor, but he stole our hearts in this story as he was, once again, so natural in his role that his work could be mistaken for a documentary, which it nearly was, as it was a docu-drama of his real boyhood.Watch young Mason grow from 6 to 18, from a cute kid into an awkward, gangly teen who often appeared quite geeky, shy and embarrassed, as we all did then, but at the same time well centered beyond his years in some crucial life matters, and still quietly seeking it in others. Quite a trip it was, and I was sorry it ended so soon, after 3 hours."
BOYHOOD,2 January 2018,8/10,"The premise of 'Boyhood' is at once really simple and spectacularly innovate and unique - film a kid growing up through primary and high school. Sounds quite unexciting, but it has literally never been done before - Mason (Coltrane) is show growing from age 7 until 18 (and so is Samantha, director Linklater's actual daughter), filmed at various stages of his adolescence over 12 years. There's no subtitles for what year/season it is - it's up to you to determine at what stage of his life he's at, but the scenes manage to flow quite easily, even though he ages multiple months/hairstyles each time.The soundtrack to the film is fantastic and a trip down memory lane itself - Coldplay's 'Yellow' opens the film, before Blink 182's 'Anthem Part Two' and Weezer's 'Island In The Sun' instantly date the year as 2001. There was plenty of great/likeable songs throughout - 2002 has The Hives 'Hate to Say I Told You So' and The Flaming Lips 'Do You Realize', 2008 has Vampire Weekend's 'One (Blake's Got a New Face)' and Foo Fighters 'Let It Die', 2010 has The Black Keys 'She's Long Gone' & Kings of Leon's 'Radioactive' and 2011 has Gotye's 'Somebody That I Used to Know', as well as plenty of others. There's also a splash of his Dad's (Hawke) influences, with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney & George Harrison songs appearing for old time's sake. One of the best scenes to me was when he gives Mason a compilation of post-Beatles recordings and passionately explains how/why it's important!So, is this Oscar bait? Perhaps. Sure, it's long (2 hours 40min), but it takes you on such a journey that by the time Mason's in the final years of high school, you've almost forgotten that you first met him as a 7 year old! With a budget of less than $3 million, it's truly astounding the commitment the four main actors (Arquette is very believable as the mum), the director and production staff put in over 12 years. I can only imagine how long editing has taken!At its heart, 'Boyhood' is a family drama - with lots of laughs thrown in, don't worry! - that tells a very realistic and well-imagined story of finding who and what you want to be in the world. It will be interesting to see if Coltrane continues acting now. The film's whole point is essentially asking - how do you recall the formative years - both the highs & lows - that shaped you?"
BOYHOOD,7 September 2020,,"Universal praise for this movie across the board, right? I have to go against the grain here. To me, this movie was trying to be Profound and Insightful, but I want a movie that is profound and insightful. I think the crux of liking this movie is relating to Mason, and frankly, I don't relate to him. I grew up in NYC, surrounded by people other than white people, didn't get a shotgun, never went skinny dipping with my dad, or made out with a girl in the back of a truck. When I was 15, I was worrying about Pokemon and SATs. I was a good kid that listened to his parents, and I was never rebellious. (Just listen to your mom, Mason!). *sigh* At the end, I was talking to some friends and realized combined with high expectations, a three-hour runtime, and no empathy with Mason at all, I just really didn't like it."

The teenager is going to grow up, all around him is full of change, all traces of growth, the sky around me is changing, and the person you love has his own life.Think about the way forward, but what is life in the end?
Are we always pursuing a dream or a casual talk
Blindly want a state, blindly want to be a person, but neglect the process, the life, the struggle
The beautiful youth years are also lost by us inadvertently
Many years later I remembered everything before
Sadness, silence, crying, and calmness
Life still has to continue
In the memory, there was the young man holding his mother's hand

Become someone who doesn't want to beThat teenager is not like a teenager
Lost and lost
What should I do in the future?When we really realize the next stage of life, everything in the past is old, and we all walk the horizon, and when the past is on our hearts, it is really uncomfortable.Probably all we have done is to go back to the old days, to go back to the previous feeling, the whole family, no one left, in the age of innocence, warm feelings, and enjoy the best belonging in the best times.All the past events have become a story

BOYHOOD,11 August 2014,9/10,"Simply STUNNING viewing. 9.5 out of 10, and one of the most amazing films I have seen in years, I can't stop thinking about it.Often films and coming of age stories show a very condensed viewpoint in a short time frame. Boyhood is actually the opposite in many ways. Clocking in at nearly 3 hours, you witness years pass in vignettes and scenarios as we follow the life of a young 5 year old boy called Mason and has family. The film concludes with 18 year old Mason going to college.It's the same actor (if you didn't know already before hand). As with all the rest of the cast, shot over 12 years, as they age, physically change, and move on. In many ways there is no plot, all you are to witness is the experience of what happens next, and how life is to be shaped.A fictional family life is portrayed in Texas, with numerous congenial scenes that everyone can relate to. Backseat fighting, shenanigans of youth, friends lost from moving away, but it's the context that is captured when you see it as real life literally grows on the screen. Friction and challenges are often presented, such as a mother who is intelligent but often makes bad decisions. The family dynamic swings from positive to negative, often with no warning. It provides great contrast as to how you see Mason's character grow up. A second father run in, and a new group of family members is a highlight, a tense period in life that if it were up to me should get Marco Perella an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor (if flat out just give him the dam thing).The film also has hallmarks and often reminds me of the Up documentary series, except it's a work of fiction. My only one complaint, if minor, is that it seems to have a hard time figuring out which note to end on. But the other great achievement is that I never wanted this film to end.The amount of risk the film makers took with this project is just mind boggling. What if the actors quit? or died? or just evolved into not being able to make their performances click on screen. But in the end it works, and it's a miraculous achievement.This is the power of film, and what it can do, and nobody has ever done something like this before, on such a scale. And it pays off BIG.In many ways the title seems wrong, it should just be called Family, or maybe just ""Life"" as it was. It's power is you don't just witness great performances, you see your life on screen through Mason. Every grown man will recognize every challenge, stumble, success witnessed by this actor in a very subdued straight laced performance. You observe it physically, emotionally, and metaphorically take shape on screen.Raw, unflinching, groundbreaking, a cinematic triumph."
BOYHOOD,7 August 2014,7/10,"Ever since hearing about this movie four months ago, I guess I really wanted to see just how well Richard Linklater's efforts were. A movie shot over the course of 12 years (Two weeks ever year). It chronicles the childhood of Mason Jr. (Ellar Coltrane), from age 6 to 18. In that time we see him with his mother (Patricia Arquette) and her efforts with various partners, forming a relationship with his estranged father (Ethan Hawke), friends shared with his sister (Lorelei Linklater) and his time at school. All of this culminating with his departure to college.The fact that they never switch out actors is fantastic in crafting a deeply intimate and personal story. I wonder what they would've done if someone sadly passed away? Richard Linklater's effort's have not been in vain, and I feel it's a process that has solidified this movie for years to come. However, it's pretty far from flawless. I feel the movie lacks a lot of the familiar charm and wit of Linklater's previous outings (""Dazed and Confused"" is one of my all time favourite's), and given this films inception it feels outside of anyone's control. The second half however, falls far from grace. By the end of the movie the audience began to share their opinions, and I was the youngest audience member in a room of 50 people in their 60's who also felt the movie dragged on considerably. It is undeniably lengthy, and the material Mason Jr. has during these scenes weigh the movie down to some terrible teenage angst romance plot. Granted it needed to be there, but it definitely needed a lot more polishing and I feel shouldn't have been in the final cut.Saying that, it is far from charmless. Pop culture references offer some pleasant nostalgia, and there's some upsetting scenes I related to very much. All their close up shots of Mason's perspective as a boy make it highly engaging, so much so I was originally uninterested with the first half. But by the time the second half appeared, I wanted to go back as I began to find all the previous material much more engrossing.Final Verdict: After 12 years in the making was the movie successful? Yes and no, but mostly yes. Linklater did a wonderful job, and of all the film-makers to attempt this project I'm very glad he did it. However, at a 2 hour 40 minute running time, certain parts of the second act hinders the overall project considerably (It's not good when your in your seat looking at the glowing EXIT sign waiting for the movie to pick up again). 7.5/10. I'll happily watch and appreciate it again, but some of these 5* reviews it's getting are crazy."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,10/10,"The chief conceit of ""Boyhood""--following the same characters over twelve filmed years--would be little more than a gimmick in a lesser director's hands, but under Richard Linklater's gentle guidance, it becomes a singular achievement, a film as freshly conceived as it is entertaining and thoughtful. Linklater's primary concern here is time and the ways we process our awareness of it; his conclusion--that we are really of the moment--seems borne out by the episodic way in which he depicts a child (Ellar Coltrane, who seems to grow into the role as he ages, ultimately becoming remarkable simply by being identifiable) experiencing events both mundane and life-changing. (Encounters with alcoholic stepfathers are the film's most harrowing sequences and you can see Coltrane's impressions of them being burnished into him.) Coltrane's wonderful performance (it's hard to believe he's actually acting) is enhanced by equally impressive work by Patricia Arquette and, surprisingly, the usually pretentious Ethan Hawke; the director's daughter, Lorelei Linklater, is an absolute delight. The film takes its time searching for its ending; when it finds it, it's simple and open-ended, fully appropriate and moving. Linklater has always been able to zigzag effectively throughout his career, effortlessly navigating between Hollywood entertainments (""Dazed And Confused"", ""School Of Rock"") and more personal, esoteric work (""Waking Life"", ""Before Sunrise""); ""Boyhood"" seems a watershed moment for him, a rumination on what the universality of his themes has meant to him--and, in their ease and eloquence, what they mean to us. I cannot recommend this film highly enough."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,3/10,"Hmmm... I don't really understand the score of 8 and something here ... I mean, I guess that this movie could be likable to people - maybe - in the USA or Canada or ... where people have in a a way that kind of growing up: the moving across the county, new schools, new parents, college, working for your own when you are 16, go to the parties and take drugs and everything that 99% of people are doing...But I guess in countries which do not have that kind of 'growing up type of life' this is just randomly boring and not interesting. I stopped the movie couple of times just to see how much it is til the end.I guess boys and girls who can find themselves in this movie, like it, the others ...But I may be wrong. 3 from me just because of Sheryl Crow's song and some arty stuff."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,2/10,"While critics and film intellectuals are busy inventing new words to describe Boyhood, let us try a little experiment. Try to describe what the film is about without using the term ""12 years"". It is pretty much impossible - and therein lies the key to the overpraise and hype. There is no denying that director Richard Linklater and his cast/crew should be recognized for their efforts in shooting over a course of 12 years, but 12 years should also not be the defining factor on whether the end product is a success. I am sure Ed Wood was dedicated to bringing Plan 9 from Outer Space to the screen, but his ambition and dedication hardly make that a good film. So stripped of the ""12 years"" allure, the end result here is really little more than a failed film school experiment following around a not particularly interesting boy in his formative years.Part of the frustration I have with Boyhood is that it does not really appear to be about anything. It seems to be trying to concoct its own genre - call it the fake documentary - where it ostensibly just follows a kid around and lets him act ""normal"" over a 12 year span and expects us to be gobsmacked by its ""authenticity"". But Boyhood is not a documentary, it is purportedly scripted. And as a scripted film, it is a failure. A good film needs a narrative, a story arc and some compelling characters to inhabit it. Boyhood has none of these. What it does have is a series of mundane anecdotes/scenes that it strings together. The majority of the scenes in question have no build-up, limited to no drama, and usually fail to connect with anything that came before or comes after. They are stand-alone moments, and none of them are of particular insight into either life in general or the central character. The film runs for a self-indulgent three hours and you start to feel every punishing moment of it early on.A huge problem is that I have no idea why Linklater feels that young Mason, the focal character of this dreck, is someone who is worthy of a film being centered on him. There is nothing special, sympathetic or noble about Mason, he is not surrounded by fascinating events or interesting people, and he often comes off as a stand-in as we wait for the real lead to show up. Ellar Coltrane is distinctly underwhelming, especially in his older moments. I am uncertain whether the problem lies in his acting or the direction, but someone with amazing talent was really required to make something of the dull cipher of Mason and Coltrane is not it. And the purported wonder of seeing young Coltrane age naturally on screen as rabidly feted by critics becomes rather laughable when we realize that we watched the Harry Potter kids age naturally on screen in those series of films and no critics I know seemed to feel that was cause for an Oscar nomination.Worse, even in the most mundane of lives, there are moments of tension, drama or surprise, even if we are only peripherally involved. Astoundingly, Linklater apparently cannot conspire any of those scenes for Mason's life, so we are left with a Cliff Notes view of a life, where the Cliff Notes has omitted anything of interest. The film seems to have no view on life, unless it is the embarrassing nonsense spewed by Mason's girlfriend about ""the moment seizing you,"" which is a riff on the Seize the Day mantra.The supporting cast has it slightly better, but not much. Lorelei Linklater may as well be a prop for all of the use she has here as Mason's non-entity sister. Patricia Arquette is given one dramatic character trait: she - wait for it - is a bad judge of men! This sets us up for not one, but two bad after school special style blurbs with the two abusive drunks she marries. Then near the end she has a big emotional moment peppered with dreadful dialog that probably cinched her Oscar, but in reality is unbelievable and comes off as 100% schmaltz. Ethan Hawke fares best as Mason's dad, but even his character is not entirely credible - perhaps because the moments that would make us understand him are missing from the film. He is a likable guy who is presented as an unapologetic liberal, pro-Obama, anti-Iraq War (in Texas!). We later see him married to a right-wing conservative Christian woman who is the anti-thesis of everything he believes and we get no indication of why or how this happened, or that this character was even open to such a relationship. This, of course, gives us the obnoxious moment at Mason's 16th birthday where his stepmom's conservative Christian parents think the appropriate gifts for him are a Bible and a gun. Could these people be any more one-dimensional? In between these moments of tedium, we get endless sequences of kids walking around aimlessly, kids walking to school, someone bouncing a ball, kids staring at the sky, kids staring in the distance, kids going to a movie, kids playing yet more video games. Truthfully, it took me three tries on On Demand to get through this whole film because these moments of pure boredom allowed me to ponder such important aspects as: Why is Arquette's voice so irritatingly high-pitched? How gaunt does Hawke look in this film? Why is Coltrane so dead-eyed and charmless? Is that a dust bunny in the corner that the vacuum did not pick up? And the most important question of all: Why is anyone under the impression that a film with no story, no drama, no tension, no interesting focal character, no good dialog, and no bloody point forgiven all its sins and shortcomings simply because it took someone 12 years to craft it?"
BOYHOOD,6 April 2015,9/10,"During the 12 year period in which the movie was filmed, chronicles the life of Mason and Samantha showing his life from childhood to adulthood. I would say what made me relate to the film, just like Mason that lots of young adults who have dreams and hope have a hard time finding their place in the world and what they want to make of themselves. While to some Mason might be like an underachiever and slacker, but deep down I think he is a good person who is misunderstood and wants to do something that has meaning. I think what made the film even more special was the way that the film was filmed over its 12 year period to give the film a sense of realism and watching the characters grow."
BOYHOOD,20 September 2014,10/10,"One must go into Richard Linklater's breathlessly intimate portrayal of life with low expectations and an open mind. It is tragic that Boyhood has gotten so much backlash for being ""boring"" or a ""gimmick"". Don't expect a masterful, eventful story in the vein of There Will Be Blood. Boyhood isn't a story so much as it is a look into someone's life. Its beauty is in its simplicity.Boyhood spans well over two and a half hours, but its time better spent than other bloated life movies like The Aviator. The film doesn't let you keep track of time beyond the ageing of the character, but often there are references that let you place the date and therefore the characters age (the launch of Harry Potter 6, Mason playing a GameBoy Advanced SP, the song ""Somebody That I Used To Know,"" etc). That is a technique I really enjoyed.As all would know, Linklater's film follows the life of Mason as he grows from age 6 to age 18. Throughout the film, he suffers the trials and tribulations of youth (self-conscious about a haircut, being new at school) but also has to deal with some much more adult ones (a broken home and abusive stepfathers). The adult situations are masterful drama, thanks to the bleak and yet intimate vision Linklater has for his story. They can compete with the best of them. Where Boyhood's appeal lies is in the beauty of those simplistic scenes. I see in Mason myself - dealing with having a bad haircut, geeking out over a Harry Potter book, having everyone look at you on your first day. As Mason moves into high school, the issues are even more relevant.It is startling how authentic the scenes that Linklater creates are. I don't know how much of the film was actually written on paper, but whatever Linklater did in writing it worked like clockwork. The scene in which 13 year old Mason and some other boys are pressured about sex and alcohol is straight out of my own life. Linklater is startlingly astute about the three ways kids respond to taunting, and even more so about how the dynamic changes when older kids are present. A simple conversation between Mason and a girl riding a bike is probably the most authentic in the movie - in only two minutes, the young actress covers three issues from my life with such startlingly accurate language I must now reel myself in before I ramble about it all review.Linklater lucked out on having four superbly talented cast members to work with. I've already covered the beauty of Mason's simple yet non simple life, which is as much a credit to Ellar Coltrane as to anyone else. Lorelei Linklater shares superb chemistry with Coltrane, both in the lovable kid stages and the awkward young adult ones. Marco Perella is Mason's alcoholic first stepfather, and steals the show with his upsetting, abusive performance. Ethan Hawke traces his own remarkable character arc, as a bumbling, hippie bum Disney Dad with no sense of responsibility, who coasts in to be the popular parent and leaving Mum to discipline, to an older, more mature father with a second chance at parenting. But who really stole the show, and all of the awards season's trophies, was Patricia Arquette as Mason's mother Olivia. Her overwhelming love for her kids can be seen in every scene. She is quiet and gentle and vulnerable. The domestic violence scenes are upsetting because of her tremendously powerful performance. The highest praise I can offer Arquette is that Olivia is real. Daniel Day Lewis may be the finest acting performance alive in There Will Be Blood, but Daniel Plainview isn't real. Olivia is. She could be my own aunt or mother. By the film's conclusion I just wanted to give her a hug.Boyhood's breathless portrait of youth and life is one of the best film's of the decade. It should have swept the Oscars for Picture and Director like it did at the Globes and BAFTAs, but Hollywood decided that it was far more important to reward a movie about how important it is to be an actor. That's not to belittle Birdman, but I know which film is better, and may Boyhood join the club of Citizen Kane, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and the Shawshank Redemption.A masterpiece.Bravo."
BOYHOOD,29 November 2014,6/10,"This definitely is a breakthrough in cinematic film, but I guess I just don't have what it takes to appreciate it. Filmed over twelve years with the same cast definitely sets it apart from other movies, however the story pretty much dried out for me. Maybe it""s because the story is about everyday, ordinary life and about a boy growing up that made it so bland. We all pretty much know what's that like, having lived through life ourselves, so I didn't really need to watch a movie about it.Also, the acting of the main cast was too expressionless and especially Coltrane, he just seemed like a kid who didn't do anything or cared about anyone, so I don't really know what the deal with that was. The other actors and actresses were pretty all right, not as bland as Coltrane (or how his character is supposed to be), but it was just pretty average overall. Ethan Hawke was the only actor who brought some life to his character as well as to the film.It's just a bit disappointing to me that they didn't do more with this. Following the same cast for 12 years, there's no opportunity for retakes after they grow up, so I guess in that sense they did plan it really well and it was well edited. However, they could have done more with it. It just feels to me that this shouldn't even be a movie, it's kind of like a documentary.Overall, the first half wasn't too bad, but the film went on for too long and I gradually lost interest. If they cut it down maybe 1/2 and hour it might have been a lot better, plus the ending left me wondering why I watched this in the first place.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
BOYHOOD,24 September 2014,9/10,"Being a big Linklater fan, I've been waiting to watch this epic (shot over 12 years) for a long time, and he doesn't disappoint a bit. I won't call it a coming-of-age (transition from childhood to adulthood) story, but it surely is one of the best movies made about childhood and growing up. From the starting scene, of the child lying on the ground and looking up at the sky (used for the movie's poster) set to the score of Coldplay's 'Yellow', to the ending scene, where the boy looks forward to his new beginning as a college fresher, not a single moment in the movie's nearly three-hour long runtime seems out of place or unnecessary.If you're expecting the movie to build upto an epic climax or event, you'll be disappointed. The movie, much rather like life, isn't made of big life-changing events; it's about the numerous small but memorable moments that form our formative years - hearing your parents fight in the other room, getting irritated with your sibling, secretively looking at adult magazines or watching porn with your friends, moving to a new place or house, making new friends, being scolded for playing around and not finishing household chores, going in a group to your favourite movie/book's release, family dinners and outings, talking to senior guys about virginity and girls, first love, first heartbreak, graduation... and everything in between. The scenes show growing up on a moment-to-moment basis and might appear quite plain, but in its entirety, you can see life unfolding right in front of your eyes. I liked how Linklater didn't lay emphasis on or lingers around any particular moment or event, and rather chooses to show the scenes in a swift flowing way, with subtlety and poetic charm.The movie is shown through the eyes of the character Mason, and from the title 'Boyhood', it may seem it's all about him, but it's not true. It's also very much about his sister, Samantha, and his divorced parents. You can see all four of them growing up and transforming over the years. With a little shift of focus, the movie could have easily be named 'Motherhood' because it deeply talks about the difficulties and satisfaction of raising children, and you get a well-rounded picture of Patricia Arquette's character as the mom.The acting is uniformly brilliant; everyone involved has done a commendable job. The newcomers, Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (Director's daughter), surely charm the viewers.The soundtrack is excellent as well, and does quite well to set the mood of the movie; from Coldplay's 'Yellow' to Arcade Fire's 'Deep Blue', the choice of songs from beginning to end is incredible. And how can I forget to mention the song which made us fall in love with the movie's trailers, Family of the Year's 'Hero'? Suffice to say, it's used at quite an appropriate moment in the movie.To sum it all up, Colin Covert of 'Minneapolis Star Tribune' aptly says, ""It's a humanist heartwarmer that celebrates just muddling through life as a heroic achievement."""
BOYHOOD,16 July 2014,3/10,"Boyhood is an epic chronicle of one boy's journey from adolescence into adult hood. Featuring an amazingly talented cast, such as Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, this film soars on every level. I very rarely say that a film is an instant classic but, this film, is an exception to my own rule. Boyhood is Linklater's Citizen Kane, it is truly a remarkable film that takes us on a journey that EVERYONE can relate to. There's nothing in this film that I can honestly say is bad or mediocre or even melodramatic considering the material. Richard Linklater has given the world some of the most interesting films starting with Dazed and Confused, the Before Trilogy feature Ethan Hawke and even A Scanner Darkly. Boyhood trumps all of them. This is a film that I can't say enough good things about. The true star of the film, Elar Coltrane, is amazing. I can honestly say that he needs an Oscar nomination for this as does Richard Linklater and everyone else involved. Ethan Hawke who portrays the father, Mason Sr. is fantastic and turns in the best performance of his career. Patricia Arquette is fantastic as Olivia, the mother. Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater, is another gem in this fantastic film. The film doesn't feature much of a plot but chronicles the struggles of growing up so quaint and so perfectly that it doesn't matter. You're invested in this film from minute one and all the way through its almost three hour run time. By the end of it, you'll be sad to see the credits roll. For me, I could have sat through this film even if it was a ten hour epic, its THAT good. Overall, Boyhood stands as one of the best films of the decade and, quite possibly, of all time. It will make you laugh, cry, smile and reminisce of your own childhood and all the bumps and bruises that come along with the ride."
BOYHOOD,23 March 2021,7/10,"Boyhood was an interesting experiment about watching Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater grow up, but it didn't have enough entertainment value to justify watching it. However, I found the girl, Samantha, to be a lot more entertaining than the boy, Mason, on whom Boyhood focuses. She really stole most of the scenes she was in, and unlike the rest of the movie's narrative, I think Lorlei was talented and entertaining enough for Richard Linklater to justify casting her as Mason's sister, even if the main story didn't really need her. Actually, it probably needed her more than we think. We should help Lorelei get better parts in more interesting movies that do not write two chapters every year. When Boyhood neared the end, my mom and I both felt sad like Olivia, hoping there would be more for us to do and experience after Samantha and Mason went to college, than just waiting around in loneliness forever for her funeral to come. Life moves very fast when you watch 12 years of non-escapist stuff in the span of 2 1/2 hours. There was more life and laughs even in WandaVision, and that was all about facing grief in reality and...Vision dying twice. The only other item of note in Boyhood: A mini-storyline with Roland Ruiz as Enrique, the only person of color with a speaking part, is a bit guilty of the ""white savior to a person of color"" cliche, in addition to Boyhood being unusually white for a movie filmed and set in Texas, but Roland Ruiz spoke in defense of Richard Linklater's backstory and interpretation, which was the exact opposite of Grisel Acosta's. Not to say that her interpretation was wrong, because both of them could be right. Roland went through that immigration experience in real life, and we should give his character more credit because immigrants like Enrique do not just wait around to be ""saved"" by white people. He didn't give Olivia credit for everything just because she gave him a compliment that marked a shift in his life. He was sincere and spoke from his heart when he thanked her for giving him a nudge in the right direction. She told him what he needed to hear to turn his life around, but he wasn't a helpless Latino waiting for her to be his ""white savior."""
BOYHOOD,28 November 2021,6/10,"What a creative, original concept to film the actors through the years! Very cool. That said, I feel like the story itself could have been more powerful and had more of a throughline. It feels more like an expose on how the years change us vs. An actual story."
BOYHOOD,2 September 2014,8/10,"There's not much more praise I can heap on a movie everyone and their mother has already touted as this year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture, so I'll keep my review relatively short. I mean, for a film that was nearly 3 hours.Described on IMDb as ""The life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18"", the plot is simple beyond belief. But when writer/director Richard Linklater uses the same actors throughout, actually filming the main character (played by Ellar Coltrane) and his supporting cast (most notably: Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and Linklaters own daughter, Lorelei) at specific ages during an actual 12 year span to tell this story, his concept begins to distinguish itself from the pack. That said, great premises and concepts are a dime a dozen. Every year there are oodles of films, all with infinite potential and only after you've paid your $11, do you realize that the only thing ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" had going for it was its premise. So, going into this screening, with the amount of critical praise ""Boyhood"" had been receiving, I was hoping beyond hope that it was more steak than sizzleIn short: It was.Profoundly touching, insightful and genuine (""genuine"" being the key word) ""Boyhood"" addresses the mountain of issues which afflict adolescent males, without (for the most part) seeming forced or contrived. In fact, I think people will be stunned at how uncontrived and unsaturated with explosive watershed moments (usually built into a film with the sole purpose of manufacturing pathos) this film has. And it's those genuine moments and small touches of reality throughout, which allow it to connect with audiences despite the lack of cancer revelations or sudden deaths.It's not really a surprise Linklater would come out with a movie like this, since the structure of ""Boyhood"" is wildly similar to that of the ""Before Sunrise"" series, only condensed into one film and chronicling male adolescence. With smile inducing song selections, hair styles and obviously the inevitable aging of the actors, to show the passage of time, there are really no words to describe the technical brilliance of this film. ""Boyhood"" is not just an example of Linklater resting on his fantastic premise. He also displays why he's such an acclaimed filmmaker, as he puts on a masterclass in camera technique, sequence and shot selection.Final Thought/One Month Later: When I first saw this a month ago, I fell in love with it as a near flawless film. Now, that I write my review, and more importantly have allowed this cinematic experience to marinate, I can see that the even though Linklater has made a film which is technically innovative, with an initial two hours of emotional perfection, the flaws within the final 30 minutes of ""Boyhood"" are there and should be noted. The final act does display a bit too much of Linklater's hippy sensibility, as Mason (now 18) spends nearly every second of the final 30-40 minutes (the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes) engaged in long and distracting diatribes, pontificating on the meaning of life. Those who disagree with my lack of enjoyment with this final stage might claim that this section of the film was not a misstep, but in fact a logical progression since the latter teenage years are usually when young men begin to seek answers for life's unknowable questions. That said, I don't believe that I am nitpicking when I say that while it may be realistic, Linklater's final act made for a repetitive and whiny finale to my viewing experience. On the other hand (and this may sound like an odd thing to say) in the case of ""Boyhood"", the ending may not even matter, since by that point a majority of audiences would have built such a fiercely emotional connection to these wildly relatable characters, that any ending could have been tacked on and ""Boyhood"" would've still been worth the price of admission."
BOYHOOD,2 October 2014,9/10,"Forget the fact that this film spans 12 years. Know this: it's a human, straight-forward story about a boy growing up, his family, his passions, being lackadaisical, finding out what he wants in life, as he is subjected to all kinds of wants, likes and you-don'ts by his divorced parents, his teachers, friends and others.Watching this reactivated my sense of how much you were told what to do, where to be, what to think as you were little, especially by adults, even if they are completely wrong and/or don't know what they're doing.The times when Mason is silent and other people practically invent what they believe he thinks, are, to me, the most astounding ones. Peoples' projections are often little fables onto themselves, but it's sad to see them overshadowing the real thoughts of youths.Linklater is, as usual, worthy of rewards for this script. It's well-written, and apart from a few clichés that don't really work in my eyes and are quite vulgar, this film is as close as you can get to the work of Antonioni - notably in ""L'Avventura"" - and Steve McQueen - notably in ""Shame"" - without becoming stocky and unpopular. This film is popular, and I think part of its appeal is because it's universal; I think anyone can see this and love it from a variety of angles and get something different out of it with every viewing.I loved Austin (the city) in this film. I really loved how some scenes were directed, e.g. the one with abuse in a garage. The music is atypical of the time and is not there to impress nor interfere.All in all: a very well-made film with very good acting. Two-and-a- half hours flowed past as though the film was an hour shorter. Sublime."
BOYHOOD,6 September 2016,10/10,"Boyhood(2014) Starring :Ellar Coltrane,Lorelei Linklater,Zoe Graham,Evie Thompson,Tamara Jolaine,Nick Krause,Patricia Arquette,and Ethan Hawke Directed By:Richard Linklater Review Whoever the critic on rotten tomatoes was that gave this a negative review must of been smoking too much. This is one true work of art. There is not one thing to not enjoy. I was a little worried because before I heard that this movie does not have much of a plot,I heard on that on a facebook group and well I believe he is wrong there is a plot here, and a pretty darn good one. The film centers on Mason and his years from Boyhood to adulthood and all the hardships with his single mother and his friendship with his father. Last year I missed the opportunity to see Linklater's final chapter of the before trilogy but saw the film right after I got all three of them on Blu-ray and DVD. When I heard about this film and how he has been filming it for about twelve years. This was such a joy to watch on the theater screen from the opening shot of the film which is the poster it has t he best cinematography of any film I've seen on any film all year. When the film opens I was expecting narration but it doesn't need any monologues just great acting from actors who throughout the film can embody their character. We see the hard life-spans of each age for Mason which is what makes this film great to identify with. I felt at ease with this film feeling like maybe I can enjoy life through boyhood before adulthood and I don't have to keep waiting for the outcome. It makes the film kind of heartwarming in that kind of sense if you think about your boyhood and Masons. This is no doubt is Richard Linklater's best film,and I haven't seen much from him just this and the before trilogy but as of know I think this is best. With it's beautiful cinematography,awesome camera shots and great acting. I give Boyhood a five out of five."
BOYHOOD,11 October 2014,1/10,"Firstly, I need to say that I have mixed feelings about the director, Richard Linklater and his movies... I like his movies, but I don't like his style, I follow his movies, but I don't particularly enjoy his way of storytelling. If I consider his filmography briefly, I liked his debut Before Sunrise, it was a warm, nice romance film, even if it didn't meet my expectations fully. I met a different film than the film in my mind. However, I called Before Sunset a masterpiece! It was ""my movie"". Unfortunately, Before Midnight was a mind numbing experience for me, because there was nothing, but dialogs! No ""cinema"", no ""art"", no ""drama"" We rather listened a story than watching a movie. People talk talk and talk, but mostly empty conversations, not something which pushes audiences to think! Finally, yesterday, I saw Boyhood and it was not a tiresome journey like Before Midnight thank goodness, but again there was only a story without any background or even subtext! If the message was ""life is empty"", then I swallow my words, but I don't think so! The movie consists of the daily routines of a boy and his family, but the movie has not any real theme or has not anything to say to us. I mean it has not come to any point other than very basic and naive things. Mr. Linklater can't catch even remarkable snapshots as he can't create remarkable moments during this almost three hours long movie! I appreciate the movie only for its shooting technique which is a milestone for sure and it requires great devotion and great labor. In the movie, there are ceremonies, cerebrations, diners etc. but there is no depth at all, no point and of course no art! The boy's inner world, his feelings, his thoughts, his soul, none of those is showed or reflected by the director which is really pathetic. The director never lets us deduce something! This is not a growing up story, this is not a movie about puberty crisis, so what is the point? And, the other main problem of the movie is that the boy including his family don't face with a real crisis or trouble or a problem and I know why! Because the director is too optimistic about life! For example, the biggest challenge in the boy's life is presented as having a falling out with his girlfriend or moving out! The boy's sister supposedly stands for the flighty girls of today, but it goes nowhere. We are expected to feel sorry for the family when they have financial difficulty, but personally I didn't, because in the following scene, we watch that the mother gives a splendid thanksgiving dinner to a bunch of people! I think Mr. Linklater hasn't seen ""Bicycle Thieves"" yet, because otherwise, he would have known struggling for life and being a kid in a world full of trouble. This should have been a depressing movie, in fact commonly it is said that this is a depressing movie, but I believe just the opposite! I had expected a depressing and realistic movie from Boyhood as I had expected a moving and beautiful art film from Before Midnight or as I had expected seeing hardships of love relationships from Before Sunrise... And don't expect an intense finale! I did, because life is bittersweet."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,6/10,"What is this? A movie about a boy growing up? Is this a documentary? No, it's not. Eventually I learned that the 12-year odyssey of ""Boyhood"" (R, 2:42) is indeed a film with a plan and a script. It does focus on a boy growing up (from 6 to 18 years old), but it's a child actor we see grow up, as he moves through the story written and shot over time by Richard Linklater. It's a unique concept, but is it well done? Is it entertaining? That, after all is said and done, is the only question that needs to be answered in reviewing any movie. The answer this time is an unequivocal kind of.Ellar Coltrane plays Mason Evans Jr., a boy who we see grow into a young man literally right before our eyes. As Coltrane moves through his young life, so does the character that he's playing, as he deals with many common challenges of boyhood – and young adulthood. We see him marvel at the world around him, get into trouble, become interested in girls, get into more trouble, form his own opinions and, eventually, start to discover who he is as a person and who he wants to become as an adult. Of course, none of this happens in a vacuum. He has a sister named Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) who is two years older than him and the two kids live with their single mother (Patricia Arquette) and see their father (Ethan Hawke) on weekends and during the summer. Samantha experiences growing pains of her own, as do her mother, who careens through a series of unhealthy relationships as she tries to make something of her life, and her father, who seems to spend most of the movie trying to find himself. And through it all, we see people drift in and out of their lives, as happens to all of us, and we see the actors age in real time. Not much make-up needed here – and not much needed to be made up for the script. This is life.""Boyhood"" is a unique and ambitious film and deserves much credit for that, but also can be challenged for many of the questionable choices that Linklater made along the way. For one thing, the writer-director moves from scene to scene without cheesy effects, unnecessary graphics or pronounced beginnings and endings – much as we all move through our real lives. However, I also saw a number of missed opportunities that a film of this kind could make more of than many others. Just as this is a one-of-a-kind film, I feel the need to write the analysis portion of my review in an unusual way.I'm often conflicted after seeing a movie, weighing the good against the bad as I work my way through the process of writing my review and coming up with a grade, but this film left me more conflicted than most. I see ""Boyhood"" as a movie with a lot going for it, but also a lot to criticize. If you're going to make a movie about a boy growing up and write a script rather than make it as a documentary, then why not have a stronger narrative thread? Why not take advantage of the opportunity to say something really important with the film? If you're going to make your characters believable and fully realized, they have to have a point of view, but why make it look like the only legitimate point of view? As Mason Jr.'s parents engage in permissive parenting and the kids' father repeatedly expresses liberal political views, why condescend to others who don't hold those views? Throughout the movie, liberalism is trumpeted, while conservatives are consistently portrayed as ignorant, simple or even stupid. Regardless of your personal views of politics, social issues and parenting styles, I think all or most of us can agree that making a film like this too one-sided in either direction can unnecessarily alienate much of your audience – people who want to like this movie and could get something important out of the experience, if they weren't so distracted by the repeated dismissal of their attitudes and opinions.These last two points may seem trivial by comparison, but I think are still worth mentioning. Why call such a movie ""Boyhood"" when the movie is almost as much about the journey of a girl, a father and a mother? And there was no video or photo montage at the end – a feature that should be a no-brainer for a film like this. As much as I enjoyed seeing these characters grow up and grow older in ways that I've never seen in a movie before, I would have liked the movie to end with some sort of compilation that emphasized its greatest strength. ""Boyhood"" has an excellent concept and Linklater should be commended for a fairly effective and entertaining realization of that concept. It's just too bad that he also felt the need to make certain aspects of the movie so off-putting and miss so many opportunities to make a good movie great. As conflicted as I am about this ground-breaking film, I'm now at the point where I have to give the movie a definitive grade. ""Boyhood"", a film with a lot of potential, that compromises itself along the way deserves a compromised rating – in this case, a mild recommendation of ""B-""."
BOYHOOD,27 December 2014,4/10,"This film was eagerly awaited after hearing of its Golden Globe nomination but unfortunately three hours of absolute tripe and one of the worst films I have sat through this year (or any year).The idea of the film to follow the life of a boy for 12 years is basically a good one but it absolutely does not work for me. The film left me unengaged and disinterested for the most part if not confused as well who people were.There was absolutely no story except for the 'step-father thing' plus referencing to adolescent indulgence in sex, alcohol and drugs.This film might appeal to a passionate audience of adolescents in Houston but in other parts of the world far away from USA I can tell you categorically it bored the pants off the viewers.The film probably would have worked as a documentary based on the lead actor rather than deceive the audience over this Nerd called Mason who sees Graduation as the be-all and end-all of his life.I suppose the film in some way is a kind of chronicle of Masons life for 12 years but it is so disjointed that half of the time you do not know what part of the story (what story actually?0 you are following.I have only scored it 4 points because clearly a lot of work has gone into the making of the film over a long period of time.There are no high or low moments, no real love scenes, no comedy, no basic human empathetic situation to enable the ordinary mature non-American to engage.The film is a sad reflection on what plateau Hollywood movies have reached that they somehow think they must re-invent the wheel. They do not. There was real potential in this movie and the opportunity has been wasted like an open goal in football.Give me three hours of 'Gravity' or 'Interstellar' any day of the week.When you have a choice of watching one of the 10 movies showing at your local Cineplex this festive period or picking up a DVD for home viewing, this film will sadly not come top of the list."
BOYHOOD,29 May 2019,6/10,"So, of course the concept sounds very interesting at the beginning, but then you realise you have seen this many times in series that last years and you saw actors grow old along the show. Same thing, only this one is a movie.
But that was the bad thing about it for me, the movie felt like a recap or resume of a long series, where you see the main events without getting any detail or getting to connect with the characters feelings, because from one moment to another, years go by and what happened just moments ago now it just don't matter.
So I never got to connect with the character. I don't know if it's the actor's fault or just the writing of his character, but I thought he was quite inexpressive and boring as a person.
I spent the almost three hours waiting for him to blow up or react to something but he never did, he just goes by with everything, unhappy but doing nothing about it.
The movie is called ""Boyhood"" but it's really about time passing, for everyone. Could be called ""Life"" or something like that. Mason doesn't feel like the main character really, in my opinion, we spend a lot of time with other characters too, which are as important as him. More on the first half of the movie, then in the second part or after it starts focusing more on him.
Anyway, the movie felt long, definitely, but it was OK to watch, not as good as I expected though."
BOYHOOD,7 July 2014,,"A boy enjoying pictures of women in swimwear with his friends. A boy being devastated after having his mane cut off. A boy debating the necessity of Facebook with his high school girlfriend. In all honesty, Boyhood is a rather apt title for this film. But it could just as well hold the name of another picture currently running in cinemas: Life Itself. That simple yet profound thing is what lies at the core of Richard Linklater's unique 12-year-spanning story and makes it relatable for everyone, regardless of sex, age group, descent, social status, or character.I, for example, have never experienced the American lifestyle, growing up with siblings, or the troubles of patchwork families, but was utterly overwhelmed by Boyhood nevertheless. There is something extraordinary about Linklater's directing, making his unspectacular, almost documentary way of dealing with youth what may quite possibly be my all- time favourite film.Only once does the writer-director resort to the hackneyed Hollywood way of telling stories instead of his own amazingly realistic approach to the subject and as a viewer, one feels this detour like a splash of icy water piercing the steady, warm flow Boyhood otherwise is. A presumably Mexican yard worker, wised up about his intelligence and urged to continue school by the mother of the film's protagonist in a less-than- 10-second conversation, suddenly overturns his life and later meets his source of inspiration for a second time, to proclaim the glad tidings in a restaurant scene on the verge of overflowing in mawkish pathos.No such issues emerge in the remaining scenes of this almost three hour long epic, however. Rather, Linklater lets his audience live through the fun and the pain, the love and the misery, and the excitement and the disappointment of his protagonist Mason with yet another wonderful screenplay in his repertoire. Leaving the cinema, it's hard to grasp one has just spent the better part of an evening in front of a screen, but at the same time, there's also a feeling of having relived your own adolescence along with Mason.Upon its release, Boyhood never held attributes such as ""most qualitatively promising feature of the year"" and the concerns were simple: how would meeting up with aging actors for a couple of days every year for more than a decade result in a tightly-structured and cohesive film? I can't exactly respond to the how, but Richard Linklater is better at it than most of his colleagues are at the ""regular"" version. Counting in his talent at capturing everyday events through a beautiful lens and his picking of the soundtrack to accompany the images (I think we can agree that Garden State has just been thrust off a throne), the American should, without a hint of doubt, receive each and every film award for directing there is. Yes, even the sci-fi and horror ones, because with a film as spectacular as Boyhood – who cares about genres?"
BOYHOOD,7 August 2019,5/10,"One note gimmick. Otherwise a fairly awful movie. Kids are mediocre to bad actors. Many supporting actors also pretty flat, or even inconsistent.And mostly, structured in a way that bugs me to no end but is popular these days. Like a typical biopic, it's just a series of disconnected vignettes, with no clear through-line to me.Regardless of the overall message: boring. Clunky as well. Specific videogames, TV news cutaways to I guess set the timeframe. Tries to use music to set mood here and there, but it feels very out of place as the rest of the film is naturalistic, or has all diegetic sound, and music.All in all, what I might expect from an experimental hobby project."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,9/10,"'Boyhood' is an ambitious project from Richard Linklater which portrays a young fellow called Mason as he embarks on a journey through adolescence after his parents' divorce. The film has several similarities to the innovative 'Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight' series. Shot over twelve years, it charts the changing nature of Mason's relationships with his mother, father, sister and two stepfathers as he goes through a number of house moves, separations, lost friendships, broken high school romances and the birth of a creative impulse.The acting and direction are close to flawless, with Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and Lorelei Linklater portraying the four principals as the years roll by. Mason's story unfolds through commonplace family interactions, sibling squabbles, school activities and camping expeditions, but the result is riveting because the characters are convincing. Although many of the events seem random, Mason's odyssey through 'Boyhood' is a coherent mythic narrative. Clues to the presence of metaphor are provided by clumsy gifts of a shotgun and bible as Mason passes through one of life's portals - an impression confirmed by the parallels between the opening and closing scenes. Linklater refrains from the temptation to insert extreme melodramatic incidents into Mason's life, but this remarkable film somehow has the character of a sweeping epic."
BOYHOOD,19 December 2014,4/10,"So there I was all hyped up about this ""modern day classic"" that was destined to win all the Oscars and that it was the ""movie of the year""... I am a big fan of drama and stories that involve character development. It kind of inspires me to see them overcome certain struggles in life and see the character achieve something by the end of the film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The movie has a good start but really leads nowhere in the end. Literally nothing happens throughout the film, it is just a completely unreal story about an immature teenager filmed with a shallow and superficial background story.I don't know if the movie aimed to tackle some social notions or the concept of movie being ""REAL""... in reality it was quite mediocre. If the director aimed to show real life then he failed because people have bigger problems out there than moving from one house to another and changing schools and friends... There are movies out there that deserve much more praise than Boyhood...Stay away from the movie and save yourself the 3 hours, watch something interesting."
BOYHOOD,13 April 2021,6/10,In many ways its magical to see a young actor get older and play their old selves - this gives the movie a magical feeling. Yet the plot is unfortunately rather dull and doesn't hold up as much - yet the idea is beautiful.
BOYHOOD,18 March 2018,8/10,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Boyhood tells the fictional story of a boy from adolescence to adulthood. It is a spectacle in and of itself because it was filmed in a span of twelve years. Richard Linklater patiently tells the story of Mason as we watch him grow up in front of our eyes. At times, the film is boring because the story is so mundane and tells a simple tale of growing up. The characters are all interesting and add a lot to the story. There are some weird moments in the story like when Patricia asks Ellar if he was drinking and smoking weed. He answers yes and she seems fine with it. I will remind you that he was only fifteen when he was drinking and smoking weed. The ending is touching and shows us that love can be found.The acting is very good. Ellar Coltrane performs very well throughout his various years. Patricia Arquette and Lorelei Linklater both perform very well. Ethan Hawke always delivers a stunning performance and this one was a stunner.The pacing is slow. Richard Linklater takes his time telling a story that deserves to be told. The scale of the movie is huge and that is what makes the movie great. The runtime is very long and isn't for the average movie goer.Pro: The twelve years of filming, an interesting premise, some touching moments, good acting, Ellar Coltrane and Ethan Hawke's performance, the elegance that Richard Linklater takes in creating this story, and a very touching endingCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some weird moments in the story, and parts of the story are extremely mundaneOverall Rating: 8.2P.S. Watching Mason/Ellar grow up was very touching. His journey through life is a tale of highs and lows, ups and downs, victories and defeats. All in all, Richard Linklater truly deserved to win Best Picture and his patience to create such a great film is a feat that should be admired."
BOYHOOD,6 December 2014,10/10,"Richard Linklater provides us with this very realistic take on life and growing into adulthood, one that is unlike anything that has been done before. His dedication to this project over 12 years is what makes this films both relatable and very memorable, and will go down as one of the more well directed films of this generation. The long runtime of this movie was never a problem as it is always exploring the dramatic events that take place throughout Mason's very eventful life. The characters themselves were all very interesting in their own ways and you can notice that the actors really lived the roles over the last 12 years. This is a very heartwarming film that allows you to really relate to the characters who by the end of the film you can believe may actually be real. This masterpiece will be remembered for many years to come and i suspect we may be seeing an Oscar for Linklater for his impeccable directing of such a masterpiece."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,9/10,"Richard Linklater tackles the challenges of coming of age in a groundbreaking unique way; he casts a boy at 6 and films a story of a fictitious family once a year every year for 12 years. In the case of the boy Mason, the movie begins when he is in 1st grade and ends as he travels to his freshman year of college. Novice actor Ellar Coltrane spent 4 days every summer from aged 7 to 19 being filmed as he grew up in real time. This technique profoundly and powerfully impacts on the movie resulting in one of cinema's most unique and powerful productions.By Coltrane's own admission, Linklater chose him at aged 6 mostly because his parents were cool (father an artist mother a dancer). Coltrane grew up in a relatively unstructured Austin, TX artistic home being mostly home schooled and so he brings that package of interesting life experiences to his character. If you are after some amalgam of a middle class, suburban, football-playing, mall-going typical American teenage boy then Mason is not your thing.""Boyhood"" gives us a microscopic view of the messy world of divorce, the family blending from new relationships and the impact of poor relationship choices on kids. By casting Patricia Arquette as Mason's mother, Ethan Hawke as his estranged father and Linklater's daughter Lorelei as Mason's sister Sam and keeping this cast intact for 12 years, the whole movie has an almost documentary feel to it because of the raw realness of the subject matter and the acting. Linklater had no set script and so the stories (and even the actors' lines) were hashed out between the production team and the actors just days before each annual shoot. This gives the movie a breathtaking realism complete with all the warts that you can imagine arising from the mother's 2nd and 3rd marriages being to alcoholics whilst she pursues a second career training to become a college teacher.Coltrane's performance is simply phenomenal. As he transitions into adolescence, various parts of the complex developmental tapestry of that crucial life phase are tackled with a realism rare in Hollywood. The acne, bullying, peer pressure and the crazy haircuts and clothing choices of teenagers all are there but so is the deepening introspection and emerging world view as the teenager transitions to adulthood. Coltrane carefully and thoughtfully gives the audience a window into his own adolescent journey by portraying the maturing Mason in a way that just cannot be shown in regular movies that usually portray a journey this long with the usual technique; that of having perhaps 3 actors portray the same character as they make the boy to man transition.Because divorce, remarriage and blended family variants have become such a common feature of modern life, ""Boyhood"" addresses the various complex issues of this tricky subject magnificently. I sincerely hope that this movie is recognized appropriately at the 2015 Oscars because it is right up there in the upper echelon of incredible and memorable movies."
BOYHOOD,12 November 2014,10/10,"If you ask me if I have seeing a movie like Boyhood before I would definitely answer yes. But if you ask me what does Boyhood has in common with all those other similar movies, I would say very little. Because Boyhood is a magnificent creation as life itself than being just another movie. Boyhood surpasses all movies in same genre and reaches a pinnacle of realism that as viewers we get astonishingly surprised of. It seems as if our own lives has being put on to a movie and some way or the other you feel that this movie is connected to you so deeply and you get so attached to it. The simple reason why it is so is because Boyhood is a project that spans 12 years in the making and us the viewers get to witness the same set of cast age a decade and it is nothing we have ever seeing before in a movie. We have seeing stories span across long time periods but non what so ever was this natural and emotional.The lead of Boyhood is a 5 year old boy Mason (Ellar Coltrane) who lives with his mother and sister. His father who is separated come to visit occasionally and this routine visits and the phases of Masons' life as growing up to become a teenager with his mother in control of the household is the story of Boyhood. As a story Boyhood has no heavy surprises or shocking moments just like most dramas of this sort has. It's very simple yet gradually moving and clearly shows how Masons' perceptions and attitude towards life evolves as he grows up. Boyhood is nearly three hours long in duration but for me it is still too short. These three hours packs 13 years of a boys' life and it is so refreshing to witness how his life go through different phases and each of these phase has its own tragedies and beauties.The other 3 main casts Patricia Arquette (Mom), Lorelei Linklater (Samantha the sister) and Ethan Hawk (Dad) simultaneously adds in to the changing time and their own struggle of survival within this 13 year spanning story which is also very well constructed. In that sense this movie can be easily centered upon any of these 3 characters as well and still will be very much appealing. But still the viewers can follow the story from several angles while engaging with the main story line of Mason and that I think is one of the many strengths of Boyhood over other coming of age movies. Yes, Boyhood is not aggressively centered upon a single storyline.Boyhood is not cheesy or over dramatic or forces the viewer to get involved with it. But it somehow manages to keep the viewer engaged and when it's over you wish there were more. Life goes on."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,8/10,"Boyhood is first and foremost a study of human life presented in movie format. The period chosen here is of a boy that ages from 6 to 18 years of age, and throughout the film we see everything that goes on with him and those around him. The concept of filming over the course of 12 years is, in fact, an interesting one and adds a transition in time unlike with most films we see. What I think Boyhood offers as a movie is a look into the life of one particular core of people, and therefore I think it can put a lot of people down since it doesn't really entertain as a feature movie. Personally I enjoyed seeing this family's story and their respective experience of life.For each cast member a different type of task was asked of them and I think all of them somewhat delivered in different levels. Ellar Coltrane was in fact a great choice as he basically had 12 years of his early life filmed and did splendidly in presenting the character to us. His sister played by Lorelei Linklater did OK considering her small list of acting roles. The adult actors Hawke & Arquette showed their experience and made the most of their roles. Arquette was great as the responsible mother who always seemed to give up a lot to make sure her children had everything they needed growing up. Hawke was more approachable as a character. His persona was a fun, free spirited man that as he grew older and met another loved one changed quite a bit, while still remaining a joyful person.Linklater's project was a risky endeavor and in the end it payed off as far I'm concerned. His direction is as fresh as it's ever been and his script is a great set of ideas that are fully realized in the movie. If I had one complaint though it would be the two stereotypical abusive step-dads that seemed to only be good at financially supporting Arquette's Olivia and her two children. Apart from that an almost brilliant film that I recommend for people looking to see a film that presents a unique vision of life's joys and problems. It is overall a journey we all share in various ways and I hope you're as much up for it as I was.Rating: 8-8,5/10"
BOYHOOD,29 March 2020,8/10,"The crazy thing about this movie is its shooting time ~ 12 years. The story of a child from his childhood to the college. His parents get divorced. Both of them movie there separate ways, but the father has privilege to meet his children. How his mom, makes certain bad decisions about partners, banking and life. But still on good terms with the father of the children. It focusses more on life of Mason to college. This movie grows along with Mason. It raises a question on life partners and unwise decisions we make?. We grow up but we still make bad decisions, thats what makes us human. The ending quote is the best thing of the movie. Rest of movie is good."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,8/10,"In a way it's amazing that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did, because, technically, not a whole lot happens, other than the day to day, month to month, year to year, evolution of the people in a family. A couple things stand out for me: one is that I'm extremely happy that nothing really horrific happened in it. Watching the film, it was as if I were waiting for something devastating to happen, and while some of the events may have been seen as devastating (to the characters), objectively, there really wasn't anything, e.g., no deaths, no terrible accidents or illness, etc. Overall, I'd say the acting was excellent, in particular, Patricia Arquette, who I always enjoy. There was one thing for me that was a bit troublesome and that was the appearance of Samantha. I kept waiting for a story line to emerge in which she was the child with another father, or adopted, or whatever, just because she looks different. Mason, his mother, and father are all blond and blue eyed, whereas Sam is brown-skinned, hair and eyes. It just didn't seem realistic. And finally, I have to say I loved the ending... it really fit."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,4/10,"here we go again, most everyone taken in by a film that is about nothing. every American family cliché is here, single mom who always picks bad guys to go out with, unreliable dad who keeps moving around. because of the novility of filming over 12 years, as if this is ground breaking, people have not noticed that the boy they are following is not just bland he is hardly there, his sister has more gumption and change than him. we have seen this over a hundred times, a mom that basicaly does not know what or who she wants, so keeps moving. i did not get any sense of the years passing apart from obvious mentions of his age and oh, the haircuts and music cues. i am a fan of Linklater's films but not this one, overlong, tedious what's tragic is that in a very bad year of way overrrated films this looks likely to grap most of the Oscars, we have surely lost our way"
BOYHOOD,28 January 2015,9/10,"If Richard Linklater doesn't win the Best Director Oscar of 2014, I will never forgive the Academy. Directing a boy's life over the course of 12 years is not heard of, that's insane. Boy did it pay off!I fell in love with every single scene of this film. It's just such a positive, uplifting film with such likable and real characters, a straightforward coming-of-age story, and excellent music. Richard Linklater knows exactly what being a family is all about. I have never seen a family in a film more accurately displayed that in this. I identified with so much in this film, it was so relatable. Every single scene left a smile on my face (and some almost made me cry). It makes me want to be a kid again and do it right. I was surprised by the pop cultural references, not just how many, but what they were. Dragon Ball Z and Halo 2 for the win! It shows all the right moments, his experiences go year by year and it displays all the rough and fun things of growing up, it's edited super well!The ending is so powerful. It's not a clichéd ending of his wedding, or him proposing, or his funeral, it just stops. The last philosophy of the film, though a tad pretentious, really got me thinking and it really grabbed me.It's such a simple concept, there's not a single plot hole or cliché in sight, It's just a straight forward life of one person. Even though I really like it, I will say it's not for everybody. It's a weirdly structured film where not a lot happens, it just kind of ebbs and flows. Either you accept what it is and move on, or you don't. I 100% did! I was so moved by this film in every way, and I'm so glad it exists."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,9/10,"A film such as this certainly needs to be respected. But it also really helps that this film is actually amazing, and isn't just a gimmick. It's so clear everyone involved gave it their all and put their heart and soul into it, and it pays off.Boyhood is essentially a collection of little moments in one boys life as he grows up. We see every aspect of life here. Happy, sad, touching, funny. It really just shows how little moments in our lives when were growing up really make up who we are. As somebody who is pretty much the same age as the main actor is now, I found the film to be easy to relate to. I was seeing a boy growing up in the same way I did, and it was unlike any film experience I have had before. Many of the themes and events also resonated with me and allowed me to connect with it. It really encapsulates the feelings I had growing up.The performances in here were great. I found Ethan Hawke to be particularly amazing, but everyone else is great too. Patricia Arquette really embodies the mother so well, and Ellar Coltrane certainly grows into his role more and more. He isn't perfect, but he works, and that's all you can ask for an actor who started the film when he was 7. It's also a fairly visually striking film, which is nice to see. It embraces the changing time periods really well and I liked how Linklater decided to show a lot of products that were popular during that time and use music that was big in those years too. It helps you remember what it was like during that specific time. Each time period of the kids life feels unique, and it's so incredible to see it progress. It uses the 2 hour and 45 minute run time to its fullest, and it lets important moments play out.Boyhood is a film about growing up and life that tackles the hard issues and general feelings of confusion that comes with life, but overall leaves you on an uplifting note. It captures the realism well, and will really give you an unforgettable film experience."
BOYHOOD,28 June 2020,3/10,"I didn't enjoyed it...not even a bit, I almost consider this a waste of my time, It's beautiful visually talking but I just couldn't see further..."
BOYHOOD,22 March 2020,9/10,"I loved this movie. I really really really loved this movie, and watch it at least three or four times a year.Great story. Great performances. Amazing character development. Very entertaining."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,7/10,"Wow, I just returned from the movie theater and felt like I really lived through 12 years of someone else's life. That's not a bad thing...at all. Sitting at an extensive runtime of nearly three hours, surely one of the movie's goals is to convey just that. Whenever we take a trip to the movies, we hope that once we're there, seated comfortably in a cushy seat and a darkened room that prevents one from reentering reality during the showing's entire duration (no sight of your actual environment), we are instantly transported from our own world into someone else's. No, I'm not promoting reality shows even though that could be interpreted from my rambling. The difference is that this life of another isn't highlighting trashy lifestyles and obnoxious messages while a pack of low-life's further their ego. This view is of the life of a boy—a very young one of 5 years old (Ellar Coltrane). He has a bossy, occasional (playful) bully of a sister around his age (Lorelei Linklater) and a stressed, over-worked, but still deeply caring/attentive, mother (Patricia Arquette). His mother and father (Ethan Hawke) are unfortunately divorced, but his sister and he still get the chance to hang out with the dad nearly every weekend. This father isn't the standard alcoholic or high-tempered domestic abuser that Hollywood pictures usually show; instead, Hawke is a fun, genuinely solicitous, and charismatic dad who just didn't see eye to eye with Mom. Believe it or not, not all marriages (stereotypically) end because one in the relationship is acutely perverse and disorderly. Frequently, it's simply due to misunderstanding, as well as the vanishing lust/chemistry the once-romantic partners used to share. Yes, life isn't as clear-cut as some would like us to believe, and this is exactly what I love about Richard Linklater—honestly one of my favorite directors working today: from his Before trilogy to Boyhood, he creates an outstandingly authentic atmosphere for these grand stories. The acting is top-notch—never overblown but effectively subtle. As a result, every character within seems like a real person talking and not an actor boasting theatrics and eagerly chasing awards. Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Marco Perella (assuming a smaller role as a stepfather) deliver transcendent performances and absorb vast complexity within every hint of emotion. There's sincere happiness, feigned happiness, the short tempers, and the haste to arguments. Everything is exhibited so damn realistically with incredible verisimilitude—the dialogue never missing a beat in making the audience feel as if they're truly witnessing this empathetic life proceed before their eyes. And that's not even the greatest element, that of which I seem to be undermining (partially because everyone has already excessively noted and praised it): the fascinating and original premise. For the first time ever, a motion picture—12 years in the making—captures this boy's rampant maturation from the mere age of 5 to the full-grown age of 18 in real time, meaning we get to see all of these brilliant actors age along with the narrative's span. These very actors are aging in front of you— adding weight, losing weight, growing hair, losing hair, and so on. That undeniably impressive quality denies the viewer any time to address possible flaws, seeing that there are some indeed—as minor as they may be. On the contrary and as to be expected, the teenage years become very awkward, and suddenly, we observe a jarring shift from the authentic, natural feel of the childhood years to the clumsy, superficial scenes that govern Mason's high school period. It's not even the essence of what I've mentioned that's the problem because that could've all been executed intentionally, but then you have the archetypal bullies that shove and curse for absolutely no given reason (do other states really experience these types of situations because I've never spotted such overt behavior where I live?) and the clichéd ""teenage"" talk that is played to the most over-the-top degree. Hollywood often makes this mistake, but I was surprised to see it in a Linklater film. Nonetheless, it's equally fascinating to recognize the current year in the narrative as a popular song from that particular year plays in the background (from 2002's ""Soak Up the Sun"" to 2007's ""Crank That"" to 2010's ""Deep Blue""). The look of the film, on another note, is simple yet verily effectual. There is no artistic pretense to be seen in Linklater's film(s)—no psychedelic editing or ostentatious camera shots; this is naturalism at its finest. Through infatuation, heartbreak, depression, introversion, joy, peer pressure, the ""stoner stage,"" we follow Mason on an epic 12-year journey with every sentiment and phase that we all primarily experienced at one point or anther. As a middle-aged individual, this could be more of a charming and heartening ride. On the other hand, as a teenager who's about to take the next step in his life (into college and professional work), it's considerably more depressing and frightening, oozing themes of responsibility, maturity, life's uncertainty, and the like. You're consequently forced to look around and reassess the course you're currently treading in life. This remarkable cinematic piece speaks to the audience in various manners as it continues to also stun with its sheer scope and ambition."
BOYHOOD,5 May 2015,7/10,"I'll start off this review by saying I know director Linklater from his Before films. Like those films, Boyhood is very interested in the passage of time. But whereas the years passed between the Before films, Boyhood actually shows the passing years. It's a neat gimmick, but not without its fundamental flaws.As the title suggests, Boyhood is about boyhood. We watch little 6 year-old Mason grow up until he's 18 and goes to college. We get a good idea of how his actions and the actions of others mark him in some way or another. His mother is played by Patricia Arquette and works really hard to support both Mason and his sister Samantha. His dad, played by Ethan Hawke, is separated from Mason's mom and so occasionally visits to spend time with the kids. I'd mention other plot details, but you get the idea: basically, life happens.Before I get to nitpicking, let me just say that basically this is a good film. The acting is great all around and there are a lot of well-written scenes, like the one where Hawke gets to spend time with the kids. He asks them the usual questions, how school was, etc. Both Mason and Samantha give typical answers to Hawke's frustration. He pulls the car over and tells them he's not going to be 'that guy', the dad who they occasionally see and politely answer. He wants them to really talk with them. Great scene. I also thought the scenes where Mason and his family move from house to house were well done. For kids, this is devastating as their day-to-day lives are swept out from under them, mostly because they'll most likely not see their friends again, despite the usual claims from parents that 'they can visit'. This is very well done, because you see everything through Mason's eyes, so you adopt his point of view when he looks out of the car one last time to catch a glimpse of his friends. Like in real life, stories and loose ends aren't always tied with a nice bow. I could give more examples, but you get the idea.Okay so, let's discuss the gimmick: the twelve-year production and ask ourselves what it really adds to the experience. I'd argue that besides occasionally thinking, 'oh wow, look they really got older', it adds nothing of substance. The whole point is to instill that documentary feel in the audience, but there's one problem: this is a film, not a documentary. Obviously, obsessively following and capturing the lives of a real family would be impossible not to mention intrusive, so Linklater tried to find a middle ground; a quasi-documentary film. But the main issue is that you're taking these actors, people who're really growing up and shoving them inside an artificial, carefully considered plot. That's not life, that's film. I guess that's what's been nagging at me: the possibility that it's mainly the 12-year production why Boyhood is all of a sudden considered this masterpiece of its genre.This wouldn't be such a problem had the story been fantastic, but even there I find myself nitpicking. This is where I rant about the nature of a 'coming of age' story and film as a medium. Consider the fact that the film aims to portray 12 entire years over the span of not even three hours. The film does its best to combine both 'major' and small events in Mason's life, but the fact is that the film's duration isn't nearly enough to portray this kind of coming-of-age tale in all its nuanced beauty. The Before films were better in that they captured moments, not entire years. Nine years would've passed and then we'd see what happened to the main characters' relationship. Anyway, what I expected out of Boyhood was this incredibly nuanced look at growing up and how little daily life things influence Mason and mark him in one way or another. While I partially got what I wished for, there were enough 'big' scenes present to make Boyhood feel less like a subtle coming-of-age story and more like a highlight reel. It's like Hitchcock said: ""Drama is life with all the dull bits cut out."" Ironically, the film aims to portray daily life with all the nuances, but these 'big' scenes make it all feel bigger than life. Yes, you've got plenty of wonderful subtleties like Hawke giving Mason 'advice' and Arquette's love for her children but bad taste in men and Hawke telling his kids to be straight with them, but you've also got 'the big bad alcoholic husband', the 'honorable yet conservative war veteran', the random scene where Mason is bullied, not to mention the fact that everyone's girlfriends (including Mason's) look like they jumped out of a fashion catalogue and not out of daily life; in other words, way too hot for a 'subtle' story like this. All this doesn't exactly help things in the 'nuance' department.What I believe Linklater and co should have done is make some kind of (mini)series out of it. If they had the patience to spend twelve years making this film, they might as well have gone all the way and turn it into a series. You could have one season equal one year in their lives, so you'd still capture the real aging process while also strengthening its impact since we'd be aging together with them.So I guess the problem is the medium. It's too constrained for a coming-of-age tale. Linklater did what he could and I respect that. I'll say again that I don't hate Boyhood. I find this type of story very fascinating and the film's portrayal of growing up was nuanced enough for me to get something out of it, but I think I expected more; less Linklater and more Mike Leigh."
BOYHOOD,27 July 2014,10/10,"I adore Richard Linklater's Direction and writing style. I have enjoyed all the 3 movies Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight. It is amazing how he directed the movie Boyhood and cast Ellar Coltrane as Mason and his own daughter Lorelei Linklater as Mason's older sister Samantha. The movie is interesting.It is life as experienced by children when parents split up and children long to be with both their biological mother and father always and forever. Ellen Coltrane's silence during intense scenes between his mom (Patricia Arquette) and biological father (Ethan Hawke)are mesmerizing. His longing to be with his dad and enjoy going out with dad are explicit in his gaze. His awkwardness as a teenager brushing off praise is marvelous. Patricia Arquette as the responsible mom of 2 kids , both lovable and pleasant, is terrific. I have never seen Patricia Arquette so absorbed in the role as she was in the movie True romance with Christian Slater. She is made to look like a hard working mother of 2, with no time for exercise. Ethan Hawke as the carefree, fun loving dad is adorable. Lorelei as Samantha is casual and nice. Direction, writing, acting by all 4 major characters is flawless. The choice of the background songs of Coldplay's Yellow and Gotye's Somebody that I used to know is excellent. I enjoyed the whole movie and think this movie is worthy of Oscar nominations for Direction, Writing, best actor, best actress, best supporting actor, best supporting actress. The movie is 165 minutes long. Loved all of it."
BOYHOOD,13 April 2020,8/10,"The movie can be summarized in one sentence: ""The life of an ordinary Texas boy 6 to 18 years old."" But I always think that the protagonist in Linklater's lens is time. We can see the marks of time everywhere in the movie. And the editor connected the materials seamlessly, making people feel that time was slipping away from their fingers inadvertently."
BOYHOOD,30 April 2016,5/10,"Boyhood took the film world by storm in 2014, touting an impressive twelve year production that followed the mundane, yet poignant moments in the life of a boy and his family living in and around Texas. While a great deal of Boyhood is utterly fascinating, the widely praised experimental film nearly collapses onto itself after the sheen of the admittedly genius premise wears off.I will be the first to admit, I was hooked by Boyhood based on its premise alone. A film that follows a normal kid, going through a normal life in what seems like real time is a genius experimental idea. We see characters age for real, without the need for makeup or separate actors, and we see a story that evolved as the actual actors did. Boyhood is incredibly interesting as an idea and for the first hour or so, it works on film. Linklater starts the story with the main character, Mason, as a small child. Mason's childhood is where the film works, and works brilliantly. The fractured family is one of the most real I've ever seen in a fictional film. This is largely due to the relatable nature of the story, but also because of a handful of knockout performances. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are especially brilliant as Mom and Dad. Because this family feels so real, I found myself enthralled by their mostly mundane lives. The film's realism functions in the same way as documentaries do, letting us peek into the lives of strangers like we are observing animals in the zoo. In this case, when the characters are not technically real, the possibility of what happens next is a consistent hook. For the first hour of the film, we see a series of vignettes depicting normal, but (because of the film's ambitious and innovative production, I presume) powerful moments in Mason's life. These vignettes are punctuated by clever pop culture references that serve as establishing shots that immediately give you a sense of place. The first hour of this film is an enthralling look at the subtle evolution of a family over the course of several years. It is a grand success of time-capsule filmmaking.And then Mason grows up.One of the riskiest moves Linklater took with this project was using the same actor for Mason from small child to young man. Ellar Coltrane didn't turn out to be a terrible actor, he did just fine, but his character, and his story, are what nearly destroy this film. Simply said, Mason becomes an extremely unlikeable character and he doesn't engage in anything important enough to keep you intrigued with his actions. As a kid, he was a good-natured, mostly polite, normal kid, but somewhere in his teenage years, he becomes an arrogant, disrespectful, pretentious jerk. It is absolutely jarring to see. And yet, I still might have been able to stand this unlikable phase if it had been just that, a phase. The problem is that lazy, hipster Mason is painted as a hero. We see several scenes of people in his life (teachers, bosses, etc.) trying to instill a bit of respect and work ethic into the kid. You would think that these scenes would be in the film as a way to shape Mason's character into something more likable; as a way to develop the character. Well, Mason doesn't develop. By the film's last shot, he is the same douchebag he was since eighth grade. Why include scenes of people giving him advice if he doesn't even consider what they're saying? In one scene, he comes home from a party after curfew, and is scolded by his stepfather (who is drunk). His step dad says what we as an audience are thinking. He scolds Mason for his lack of respect, his mumbling, arrogant way of speaking, and his lack of ambition. Yet, instead of seeing Mason take this criticism to heart, we as an audience are expected to dismiss this as the drunken ramblings of evil step dad #2. It is insanely frustrating to watch this unlikeable jerk, wander through life and learn nothing. Yes, in some ways Mason becomes the free wheeling rebel his estranged, idolized father was, and that is a very well done aspect of the film. However, at some point it just becomes so physically unpleasant to watch this character on screen. It is as if he was deliberately designed to be unlikeable, but if that was the case, the audience would, at some point, get to see him get his comeuppance. In this film, that never happens. I found myself asking, ""Why am I even watching this? I hate the character I'm supposed to identify with and I'm not going to get to see him learn or change."" In the back half of Boyhood, small moments no longer have meaning, payoffs don't develop, and in short, nothing happens. We see an unlikeable person wander aimlessly through life.My reaction to the movie is so clearly split down the middle. I have to commend Richard Linklater for this film. I don't think the twelve year production is a gimmick as some people claim, but rather a fascinating filmmaking experiment. For a third or so of the film, its execution is equal to its ambition. It's when the story drifts from the interesting family dynamics to the pointless moping about of a pretentious and unlikeable teenager that the wheels fall off. For every moment of quiet poignancy, Boyhood has two extended scenes of extreme frustration. I am a strong believer in likability in movies. Likable characters can save a movie that is less than brilliantly crafted, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, unlikable characters (especially a protagonist) can sink a movie that is otherwise well made. As much as I admire the ambition of Richard Linklater's Boyhood, the final product is firmly split into the utterly fascinating and the stupefyingly frustrating.50/100"
BOYHOOD,1 February 2015,5/10,"This film has attracted a lot of attention for being filmed over a period of 12 years to show scenes from the life of a boy growing up. It's a unique idea, but let's be honest — essentially all that comes down to a gimmick of casting. On to more important issues.The film is lifelike in a way, but in a quite special way. Like life, it's a string of incidents that don't really add up to any one thing. They can be selected and highlighted in order to make some sort of point, but taking them all together, you end up with nothing in particular. Your life is like that. ""Boyhood"" is like that. Art is not like that.One scene after another occurs, shows a moment in the boy's life, then is gone, and we move on to something else. In school, for example, there is a scene where two boys confront him in the washroom aggressively, threatening him for no particular reason that we can see. Then it is over, we move to another unrelated scene, and nothing ever comes of it. Over and over this kind of non-event is shown. Why show it if it was just a moment that never led anywhere? It couldn't have had any significant effect on his life if he wasn't bullied more than that abortive little attempt. He would forget it. He would never tell it as a story to anyone. It would not be part of his life story. But if it's a completely insignificant incident in his life, why are we watching it in the film? The writers present pointless many moments like these. Yes, it's like life when the mom and her 2 kids move away from the home they shared with the psychologist stepfather and his children, it's like life in that they at first feel concerned about what will happen to their step- siblings but move away and forget about them. Life is full of untied ends like these. But in a work of art, the audience or reader's interest is raised for a purpose, to fulfil in some way or other later. In ""Boyhood"" the audience's interest is raised, then allowed to wither on the vine in a most unsatisfying way.Watching ""Boyhood"" is something like reading a person's diary. There's a certain level of interest in simply getting a glimpse into another person's life. But unless the person is famous, or a member of your family, or in some other way specially connected to you, you will not continue reading for very long. It begins to seem trivial and dull. That's how ""Boyhood"" seemed to me.I think that whatever it is, even though it is in an artistic form, namely, the form of a film, it is simply an enormous failure as a work of art.It has been a very bad year for Academy Award nominees. The only one I've found more than mediocre has been ""The Imitation Game."""
BOYHOOD,30 July 2015,7/10,"No doubt, the concept of ""Boyhood"" was awesome. Watching these characters age throughout the film was a joy to watch. They never tell you when the year has changed but you can pick up on subtle things like the technology or what the new fad is. One scene in particular was great when a couple of the characters were talking about if a new Star Wars movie was possible. Who knew that when this movie would be released, that there would indeed be a new Star Wars film on the horizon.The biggest problem for me was, nothing really exciting happens. Is there some conflict? Sure a couple of times but nothing special. Just shows that the mom has bad taste in men as she marries two separate drunks and leaves them both. The best scenes are with Ethan Hawke who plays the father. However, he wasn't the main focus as the title would indicate, it's about the young boy who we watch grow into a young adult.It was funny at times, but overall its really just a movie about a young boy growing up. He's not that likable of a character, yet you don't hate him either. I guess I expected more after such hype. I bit of a disappointment but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
BOYHOOD,27 August 2014,9/10,"I was really looking forward to seeing ""Boyhood"", as those who have read my reviews know I like movies about children growing up, and the problems they face. As others have noted, the nearly 3 hour film covers 12 years in a boy's life, with the same main actors throughout. About 15 minutes are devoted to each year, and the transitions are amazingly seamless. I really did enjoy the film overall, and understand that the idea is to get the overall feeling of watching a boy grow from age 6 to 18 in a realistic manner, with no easy answers, just like real life. And I admire how well the film did just that. I consider an 8 rating to say I really liked the film. However, I'm not sure I would want to watch it repeatedly, as I have done with many of my favorites over the years. There just weren't enough events that carried emotionally charged content, other than the scenes with the alcoholic stepfather. And while the performances were very good all around, the film didn't leave me with a ""Wow"" feeling, probably because it wasn't trying to. Here are 5 movies I would rate higher that are about children's problems growing up: ""Dear Frankie"", ""Canvas"", ""Jet Boy"", ""In A Better World"", and ""Lifted"". However, they are all more sentimental, so if you don't like to bring the tissues, you will probably like ""Boyhood"" more than I did if the subject matter interests you."
BOYHOOD,3 February 2015,7/10,"Boyhood is a movie about a young photographer and his life. This movie is based in America, and often it shows the great American landscape. What is the underlining theme of the movie? I think this movie is about how, especially, Mason Jr. - the main character - constantly changes. This movie was filmed over twelve years, starting when Mason Jr. was a kid, and ends with him going to college. The film directors signature is documenting the natural human aging process on film. This is a physical human detail which seems to coexist with the psychology of the man. Does the outside physical character of the man, resemble the inner character? Or is it the other way around? Within this movie, the character called Mason Jr. had a deep flux. This means that he was not stable. To me, he did not find his way, not yet anyway. He had sensitive ways and at the same time he was reckless and blind to the needs to others, like his mother's needs. He did seem self -centered in his world. He also seemed to cocoon himself from the world, never developing deep friendships nor deep relationship ties with his past, his family nor his friends. Does this movie represent the lostness that an American is born into? Could this be the Jim Morrison gene, that had been transplanted into all of Americans now? The kind of gene that has a romantic sensitive side but which is ultimately self destructive."
BOYHOOD,8 September 2014,5/10,"After living in the same family house for 24 years, I mean mansion. It's really just a castle the size of Belgium - not a big deal - I gained some curiosity towards ordinary people, average people and their average lives. Just so happen to be, a movie called ""Boyhood"" was released. I heard it was quite average and started watching itOh boy! Was the first thing I said. This movie is indeed quite average. It tells the story of a average boy who becomes an average teen and then an average young adult. He goes through many average situation in his average life in average way. Very average, I must say.Not only was he and his life average, so was his family, their lives, and the family members, average. Many other things, such as everything and all, were also average, but I guess my point has been taken. Masterful, amazing, great epicness and thought-provoking layers and faces of... average. Not really. Just average, average, average and average layers and faces of... average.When it comes to movies, motion pictures, and entertainment in generally, there has never been an aim for average. Was it anyone anywhere, directors, studios and writers always try to be something. There is a way, a path, at least something that leaves a mark, fingerprint of the maker to what they make. Could it be that ""Boyhood"" is actually the most original piece this medium has ever given birth to just because no other film has ever been as average as it is? Despite living in a house the size of Belgium, I have seen everything ""Boyhood"" shows to me. Many times, in many formats, in ordinal daily life. To the question, I must say ""no"". There is no real reason to appreciate the average ""Boyhood"" is all about. It doesn't have anything spectacular to say, it doesn't aim to be anything at all, it just takes the route of being... average. I don't hate this film. I enjoyed it. I watched it all. I don't dislike this film either. It is not good nor bad. One thing it definitely isn't is memorable, other a life changing, third though- provoking. I still have to use this word one more time as it is the most average movie I have ever seen."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2019,7/10,"""Boyhood"" is a famous 2014 film. Famous because it took 12 years to make, and tells it's story of a boy growing up in real time. And it sounds interesting. I mean, 12 years, that has to be good. Well, if you ask me, it isn't.Now, I know a lot of people like this movie. But that doesn't mean I have to. My problems lay mostly with the acting and the runtime. In the next few paragraphs I will list the problems and explain them all.1.) Lack of realism. ""Boyhood"" is a movie that tries to be very realistic in it's portrayal of the struggles of growing and being a kid. But for a movie so adimate on realism, this film doesn't know how kids talk or act.A good example of this are most of the scenes with the kid characters. It's clear that the writers don't know how kids talk and act around each other. Now, when they are around the adult characters, they're fine. But when interacting without them, it's cringe worthy. Like a scene with the kids in elementary school, where the girls gossip about lesbians, and boys argue about Star Wars, repeatively saying ""Yoda"". As a teenage boy, who to be that young, I can tell you, I never talked like that. But there's an even worse scene, where the kids are teenagers hanging out. The kids talk about sex and describe rape asking if they had ""a piece of ass"". And at that, the acting terrible, and such phrases as ""true dat"" are used. And it's I couldn't believe how bad the scenes was. ""This has a 100% on Metacritic?"" I asked myself.2.) There's no conflict. If this film was 90 minutes, I would give it a pass. But it's almost 3 hours. And you feel every minute of it. And what makes it worse is the complete lack of conflict.There's no overarching narrative, and it's just boring. The main character is just a normal kid, and he's so boring. The film feels like it has ADHD, it can't stay on one plot. First you have the abusive step-father, then not even an hour in, they leave him, and he's never seen again. Then unrelated events occur, and the movie just stops. And many may claim the movie's about the mondain things of life, but any interesting movie would focus on interesting things.3.) It's forgettable. Okay, this movie took twelve years to make, do you remember anything else about the film? I really don't, I watched it not to long ago, and I'm starting to forget it. It's just boring and overly long, and people only remember it because it took so long to make. That's it's one gimick. And even though there are films like the ""Up Series"" (a much better film), a series documentaries about the lives of a group of British kids. And shows like ""Roseanne"" where the people get older, both much better and more memorable products. So the idea isn't even as original as you might think.What I like: Okay, I actually did things in this movie. First off, the father played by Ethan Hawke is well written and memorable. Feeling like a normal father, a father that likes to spend time with his kids. And the movie is also shot very well. And the mother is also decent. But these praises don't make up for the flaws.I can kind of understand why people like this. It's acted well (at least the adult actors), and is shot very well, but does that really make up for bad writing and an overly long runtime? My answer is no."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,7/10,"Richard Linklater is undeniably one of the most unique voices in film, right now. He seems to always be pushing himself, and i find that admirable. Its amazing to me that the guy who gave us ""SCHOOL OF ROCK"" is the same guy who gave us ""A SCANNER DARKLY"". As a result, i'll always give a movie from this guy a chance. They are always unique, and have something interesting to say. BOYHOOD is no different. Each segment of the film takes such a fresh and interesting snapshot of the world at the time of its filming. It's really interesting to revisit the early 2000's. It is like a trip down nostalgia lane for the viewer. I think that is the real strength and revelation of the experiment that is BOYHOOD. You get to relive all of these moments in our recent history filmed in a manner that keeps them fresh because, at the time that they were shot they WERE fresh.I found the actual characters that we are asked to follow through the trials and tribulations of their lives to be slightly overdone. Ethan Hawke is a charismatic guy, and it is easy to enjoy his performance. The rest of the acting is a mixed bag. That's to be expected, given the nature of using the same actors and actresses at various stages of their development, i think.Overall a worthwhile and interesting endeavour worth watching once."
BOYHOOD,2 February 2015,1/10,"Boring boring boring boring... I wish I could fill up this review with just that one word, but IMDb won't let me.How can anyone sit through 2 3/4 hours of watching someone's boring life roll by? What a waste of film - or is it all video tape now? I don't care how long a film took to make, how the actors aged over the course of the film or anything else.I want a film to tell a story and this is more like watching someone's boring life as they grow up. So what? Who wants to watch that? What is it with all these people who think that is marvelous. They really must have incredibly boring lives to think that this film is even the remotest bit interesting.This film is almost as bad as Birdman which I watched completely thinking that at some point something interesting must happen. But it didn't. Just some arty-farty long camera shots. Whoop-dee-doo.And this one was filmed over 12 years? Whoop-dee-doo."
BOYHOOD,21 February 2015,4/10,"Tomorrow night this may win some Academy Awards - that will prove once again how out of touch I am with the movie elite. It appears that people either loved it or hated it. I just found it uneventful, not compelling in the least, not captivating - in fact a waste of 2 hours and 44 minutes. How can it take 12 years to produce something so bland?Interesting to see the actors age - especially the kids. But that is about it.You know sometimes people complain about movies and the news - ""Things do not really happen like that! They only print the sensational aspects of a story"". . . . and so on. Well, if those comments are true (and I think they are) - thank Heavens for sensationalism. If this is really what average life and growing up is all about - let's forget about it. Dull, slow, nothing ever really happens. That is ""Boyhood.""I hope you do not watch it, unless you like slow, uninspiring, boring movies. If so - go for it."
BOYHOOD,13 December 2014,9/10,"'Boyhood' has become one of the most critically acclaimed films of not only this year but also this decade. There is no doubt this film is technically brilliant, but will any normal or average movie- watcher like this movie? I would say it will depend on your perception of a great film. Many people like fast-paced action oriented eventful movies which entertain them with fancy lines and twists. But there are many who also like story and character driven absorbing films which make you experience the film along with its characters.If you fall into latter category than Boyhood is worth watching. Others might not like it very much. I am no film expert, I just want to say how this simple journey of a boy through his young age is transformed into an epic experience.The movie unravels the journey of a boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from age 5 to 18. We see him grow on the screen as he begins to understand life slowly. His mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) have divorced. Mason and his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) live together with their mother. Right from the first shot of Mason staring at the sky till the last shot, Boyhood captures your attention with brilliant acting, beautiful camera-work and truly realistic screenplay. We see Mason play with his friends, go camping with his dad who visits them on weekends, fight with his sister and doing many more things which we ourselves do in our daily life. Some of it was socially and culturally different for me as I don't live in US but we all are nostalgic about our childhood.Here we quite easily relate ourselves with the life of Mason. Moreover since I have also grown up our the about the same period of time, the movie felt much closer. There are many pop- cultural,political references like Harry-Potter, the US presidential elections, etc which make it more lively.'Boyhood' also gives us many insights about life. The one I liked the most was about change. Change is always part of our life, its how we adapt to the change that defines us. Mason undergoes many changes like moving from one place to another, changing schools, changing dads as his mother always falls for some drunkard, friends in his life change and at the end girlfriend issues. Despite all that Mason moves on and that's what is life all about. After giving some time we are again happy and all those events are just memories or to be more precise as Olivia says 'milestones'. And as his Dad says its all about winging it, if you are feeling stuff than you are more than living well. When you grow up it feels like just yesterday that you were young and time flies by.Same way Mason moves through his life.One of the first interesting thing I knew about Boyhood was that it was shot over past 12 years with the same actors growing up in the shoes of their character as well. Its really astonishing to see the flow of the film nothing seems discontinuous despite being filmed over such a long period of time. Brilliantly written and directed by Richard Linklater. He deserves as many nominations at the awards as possible. Shame that I haven't seen any of his other movies. The child actors Ellar and Lorelei were very good, but it was both Patricia Arquette as mother and Ethan Hawke as his biological father who were exceptional. The time Mason Sr. spends with his children on weekends were exciting to watch. The first half is more about parenting while the second explores what Mason plans to do with his life as he as about to graduate from high school. I felt it just loses its consistency slightly for some time in second half were Mason has no idea what to do with his life. I personally think second half is bit let down compared to first half. The changes kind of became swift cutting fast from one to another and I couldn't quite grasp it quickly.Still, the it ends on high though.Again I wished they had shown something more grand but wait this is how it is in real life. Our lives are not just over with some big event, life just continues and so does Mason's life.In the end Boyhood is a masterpiece of modern times. It will win many awards and may also be hated by many for it and being overrated just like Gravity last year. But I am glad that I spent 165 minutes watching this brilliance and wished there was more of it. Certainly one of the best movies of the year.RATING:[4.5/5]"
BOYHOOD,19 May 2020,8/10,"A unique film of its kind. A film that thanks to its 12 years of filming remains in the history of cinema. The main actors grow up, the film follows the protagonist over time until he goes to university and becomes an adult."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2020,10/10,"I think this is just one of the few perfect films ever made. Boyhood is also one of my favourite films right now, everything in this movie is so well done.Patricia Arquette, Ellar Coltrane, and Ethan Hawke are just perfect and watching Ellar grew up is amazing. When i heard that this movie took 12 years in the making the first thing i thought was: bullshjt. The script is so natural and incredible written. Patricia basically stole the movie because she deserved that Oscar. The characters are very well developed and don't be fooled by the runtime, yes it's almost 3 house long but is worth every freaking minute.This movie made me rethink everything, it leaves you thinking over and over, i'm sad that i couldn't watch this on the big screen. This is the last film I saw in 2019 and i'm glad it was this one.Happy new year to everyone."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,8/10,"Congratulations to Boyhood on winning the Golden Globe Best film and Best Supporting Actress!Even if it does not win anything, Boyhood is quite a comfortable and pleasant movie to watch. You are bound to find some traces of yourself or your family members or your friends in some of these scenes because they are so close to life. Sometimes it even reminds me of the clips we will see before we leave this world.Twelve years in the making, it feels like we are also growing with Mason (Ellar Coltrane), who starts as a five-year-old boy daydreaming about why things happen in life, including his parents' separation. What we are watching is not just him, but all the people around him who also grow up/mature over the years. When the film begins, a single mother, Mason's mom (Patricia Arquette) decides to move to Houston with her two kids to be closer to her mom and go back to college, where she will meet her second husband. As a kid, Mason does not even have time to say goodbye to his childhood friends. His older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), offers a females perspective of growing up and we see her maturing into a young woman going to college. Mom's second marriage turns sour and decides to move out with Mason and Samantha. By then she has established a career and soon enters into another relationship where her kids also need to adjust to during their stormy teens. One of the pillar of the movie is that all through these 12 years, they meet their father (Ethan Hawke) regularly, who seem to offer a sanctuary vent for them to step back and look at their own life. Of course Dad matures over the years, gets remarried and starts another cycle all over which is another story. Watching this film is like visiting a long term friend, catching up with him/her and realizing we have many things in common. Life can be dramatic at times but mostly it is just calm and non-eventful but it is real. Yet, whatever happens, it is and will be our collective memory. Before watching this I was a little worried because I think the Sunrise and Sunset series was kind of too much talking and not much action going on. But Boyhood is so interesting and there are so many characters to follow that it was going through a family album. There is no big moral lesson here. We just witness people change and evolve over time and begin to realize that whatever happens, life has to move on. So just enjoy the ride while you can. Mason always have this observer smile, as if he is trying to cipher what is going on in the adult world. Yet the director does not offer any explanation. He just lay down what happens, and highlight the important moments for us to ponder. I am sure we can identify with many characters, regardless of our cultural and age differences.Pacing was good. Mason's mom works hard to provide a better life for herself and kids. Patricia acts very well and portrays a conscientious, overworked and ambitious mother who gains weight over the years but finally decides to lose all her possessions. But not only her, we also witness everyone grow up or age over the years. Sometimes sad but hey it is part of life. It is much more lively and visually stimulating than the sunrise series and I yearn for more. I hope director Richard Linklater is secretly doing another 12 years tracing Mason's college life and venturing into adulthood, his mom's empty nest challenge etc while intertwining with what is happening in the US. He can name it manhood."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2015,8/10,"Boyhood is a rare film...or should I say once in a lifetime film. Its a rare film because it took 12 years in the making. None of the actors were changed as the time progressed. The story beautiful matured out as the years went by.And yet after seeing Boyhood..I was speechless. I at many times saw myself as Mason, the protagonist. A nice little boy who needs that little more attention. As the movie got over, I just recollected my school and college days and how like Mason, we are wondering where life would take us.The story also tells us how the life of kids is affected by the parents. Patricia Arquette in her deserving Oscar winning performance portrays the role of women who not once but thrice chooses wrong men. These decisions of her change her and her kids life accordingly.Ellar Coltrane as the kid is brilliant and as he grows older he is nicely plays the bit confused teenager seeking answers. Richard Linklater's daughter Samantha is brilliant as Mason's elder sister while Ethan Hawke nicely plays their loving father.Beautifully shot in Texas, its a pity that neither the film won the best film or Richard, the best Director at the 2015 Oscars. I personally believed they had to.Anyways, a brilliant film and a must watch."
BOYHOOD,12 March 2015,7/10,"Probably every American interested in film saw Boyhood long before I did last week, but somehow I missed it in theaters and, as Boyhood emphasizes, time passes . . . ! From the beginning, the idea of a film following the same actors over a protracted period was both interesting and risk-laden. What if some calamity or professional conflict overrode the cast's ability to continue? I wonder whether director Richard Linklater cast his daughter Lorelei in the film as a partial insurance policy against that eventuality? She plays as the main character's annoying older sister Samantha. Quite nicely, too. Cast intact, filming proceeded off and on for a dozen years, following Mason Evans, Jr. (played by Ellar Coltrane), from ages six to eighteen, and the continuity of characters across situations, levels of maturity, and the ups and downs of life makes for a compelling narrative concept. All the main parts are well acted, including the kids, the parents (Ethan Hawke and Academy Award-winner Patricia Arquette), and the mother's problematic husbands. The script grew organically, evolving based on what went before (like life), as well as on experiences in the real lives of the actors. Ethan Hawke, who plays Mason's biological father, is a person of local interest, having grown up about a mile from where I live. (A few local junior high girls helped answer his fan mail in the early years.) The stage was set for this feat of filmic time travel in Linklater's Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight trilogy, in which Hawke also starred, and he calls this latest film ""human time-lapse photography."" While many wonderful things can be said about the slow unfolding of personality that the movie conveys, to me it was about a half-hour too long (at 2 hours, 45 minutes), perhaps because I felt insufficiently engaged with the characters at any age. Having shot footage at all these different ages and stages, it's as if the filmmakers felt obliged to use more of it than they absolutely had to."
BOYHOOD,12 September 2014,8/10,"It is good to see how a movie so simple in set-up and execution works out so fine, and gets so much deserved attention and accolades from both press and public. Although I seem to be a bit more reserved in my rating then most, I too acknowledge what a fine-crafted piece of cinema Richard Linklater has made, one of those rare pieces of art that truly make the viewer experience the passage of time.'Boyhood' is basically a movie without a clear plot, which is not to say that a dramatic arc is missing. We follow a small family, consisting of mother, son and daughter, and occasionally the mostly-absent father, throughout 12 years of their lives, with focus on the two children and the boy Mason in particular. He is 7 years old at the start, parents divorced, mother has problems to make ends meet. Mason enjoys all the things that boys like at that age, like playing computer games, fighting with his older sister, being mischievous with friends, and enjoying time with his dad if he ever shows up. Mason gets progressively older throughout the movie, and we get fragments of those 12 years, with everything that changes, or stays the same: getting to know people, good ones and bad; learning valuable things, but also making mistakes; experiencing joy, sorrow, and also disappointment. And we witness how all those moments make us who we are.The same actors were filmed throughout a 12-year period which makes for a marvelous experience: we really see the same characters grow and mature on the screen, and not simply the next actor taking on the role. Making such a chronicle of a phase in someone's life could easily lead to a string of clichés, but Linklater is very careful to avoid that. There is no specific focus on the 'highlights' in this boy's life, more often we see very mundane moments, as if to say that life isn't merely a sum of important moments, and that the relatively uneventful ones are just as important as the more memorable events. It is a subtle approach which has some limitations. I sometimes got the feeling some drama was missing, as if watching some real-life soap and hoping that finally two characters get in a fight and things get stirred-up. There is one segment in the movie that is guaranteed to cause shivers, but other dramatic moments are nowhere near that intense.No years or dates are mentioned, so we have to find out for ourselves how much time has passed, and what has happened, or stayed the same (the haircuts help, though). What makes this movie enjoyable all through the 165 minutes is the amount of sharp observation and capturing of those moments which we also recognize in our own lives. It is in the small details, such as the coming and going of technology, important historic events and music; it is in the people that affect us, such as the people that enter Mason's life, and sometimes go again, with or without explanation. We all have relationships that are more meaningful than others, and sometimes people disappear from our lives without us hardly noticing. There are moments of sheer brilliance, where young boys discover a Victoria's Secret catalog, and later discover on-line porn. This is a movie that says as much about living as it does about the times we are living in now.The movie is probably best summarized by the observation that we do not seize the moments, the moments seize us, and that we are always living in the 'now'. This movie allows us to see a life in a succession of moments with every moment as part of a whole, with the definition of past, present and future having little meaning. A true work of art."
BOYHOOD,7 August 2020,9/10,"Beautifully mundane masterpiece. Remarkable in how unremarkable it is, ropey acoustic covers and all"
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,4/10,"Such a boring movie, like watching paint dry... If i remove the gimmick that was used all that remains is a boring snooze fest, the story was nothing extraordinary to offer, just follows a life, and a not very interesting one i add. The actors are very good, but that does not a good movie make. I feel like i've been conned. I knew i should like it, everybody else does, but i couldn't. I know my review does not have much content, but neither does the movie, so there's not much i can do there. Stay clear, and let's hope movies stop creating gimmicks when there is no creative power behind the projects. If they used 5 or 6 different kids, this movie had a 5 IMDb rating and would never be considered for awards. I guess people like to be conned. Not me. Stay way."
BOYHOOD,27 September 2014,8/10,"Most people who love movies know by now that Richard Linklater is a unique and special filmmaker. He has crafted at least a couple of masterpieces already. This film is one of Linklater's best yet, and that's saying something. Hollywood usually doesn't dare to make films this genuine, this introspective, this meaningful. The film is beautiful, it's not just Hollywood slop entertainment, this film is art amongst the rubbish. Boyhood truly is a landmark film, one that will not soon be forgotten. Forget the 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy hype, leave that to the kids and the lazy minded, this is the film to see! 8.5/10"
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,9/10,"I really liked this movie. It is one of those that stays with you after it is done. I guess the main character is suppose to be the kid Mason, but really I felt like it was his whole family. Him, his sister and his Mom and Dad. They feel like the story to me. As a divorced single mom, there were so many things I could relate too. Ethan Hawke did a great job playing a flaky Dad who loves his kids but is absent, and then starts to grow up and be around for them. That was touching. My ex is a good Dad and part of their lives, but let's face it, the Mom is the anchor in most divorces. I think many people will relate to this. Patricia Arquette was spot on as the Mom. She always has a very natural feel to her acting anyway. I was very touched by the ending when Mason goes to college and seems to find his ""tribe"". That was moving to me. I love the actor who played Mason. He was great. So natural and interesting to watch. I was not bored for one second in this film, and it is long. After watching it, it made me reflect on my life and how life really is all the little moments that flow from us. Cherish them."
BOYHOOD,19 August 2014,4/10,"""Boyhood"" Hits all the Marks and Still Misses""Boyhood"" is a critical darling, and that's putting it mildly. It has a nice, non-controversial family, and it presents every ""coming of age"" childhood milestone at least once. Thus, it has no focus. The technique, filming the movie over 12 years with the same actors, is an interesting experiment in film. However, its technique gets in the way of quality story telling and substance. Trying something innovative does not mean the film should get a pass and automatically get raves. In the film there's one bullying event, one break up, one drunken night with the guys, one of everything, like a sample platter at Golden Corral. There was even one non-white character in the film. Moreover, there is no follow up on any of the events. What is so masterful about that? The film has a series of disconnected events in a boys life that had no focus. ""Growing up"" is not a plot, no matter how many people are fooled into believing it is. The dialogue was contrived. It's as if every line from teenage Mason was taken from a Smith's song. As I was watching, I couldn't help thinking, ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now "" At least the film didn't have an out of place tragedy like a ""Girlfriend in a Coma."" Yes, I wanted to stop him, for I had heard that one before. Morrissey does pathos better and with him we don't have to suffer through two hours of pretentiousness. Mason was too confident about his misery. His dialogue we pre-packaged, as if he was reciting a script, not living in the moment. The film features a series of moments, a few interesting ones, but mostly tiresome first world problems from an uninteresting boy and family. As a film buddy of mine stated, ""the film could have been called 'The Discreet Charm of the Petite Bourgeoisie.' "" However, it wasn't charming, nor funny, nor revelatory or original like the Buñuel classic. With the exception of Ethan Hawke, who, to be fair, had the best dialogue in the film, the acting was mediocre. Perhaps filming the movie over 12 years made it hard for the actors to stay sharp and focused on their characters, so the acting was uneven throughout. There was nothing of note in the music, other than the cliché' of highlighting the passage of time with a hit song in various scenes. It was cute at first, then it became tiresome. Rating: Rent itIf your sister, mother, brother or friend wants to see it, you can watch it together and not upset anyone with confusing events like actual poverty and unexpected occurrences like black people appearing on the screen. Moreover, you can talk during the film because there is no need to really pay close attention while it is playing. You won't miss anything. Otherwise, see the infinitely better ""The Way Way Back"" if you want to see a cute coming of age movie. This movie has already risen into the pantheon of overrated movies, even before it wins some undeserved Oscars. It was style over substance. If I had to describe this film in one word, other than overrated, it would be ""trite.""Peace, Tex Shelters"
BOYHOOD,3 March 2015,9/10,"Boyhood was a great film. There's so much to it that I wouldn't do justice by simply applauding the great performances or production. It's deep and very personal. Touching on things we all know yet seldom acknowledge, like the rest of this review...You never truly know where you'll end up in life. But that's not the emphasis. It's the actual time that you have living in the present and trying to remember that you can live it milestone by milestone or moment by moment. It's hard to predict which ones will stick with us, so why not try to make the most of them all? No one has all the answers. You live and learn and hopefully take heed of others' advice, but you ultimately (should) make the decision yourself. Boyhood is the story we're all familiar with yet struggle to sometimes accept or endure. At times it feels like everyone is trying to get somewhere: a new job, a dream house, another degree. Sometimes you just wish it could all stop and rest. And maybe that's the great thing about life: you live how you want, and after your time is up, others will continue living. It's the lack of time we have that sometimes puts weight on our hearts, but maybe that's why we should try and least make it special for the little that we have. At the end of our lives, whether that be 1 hour from now in a car or 10 years ahead on a hospital bed, will your last fleeting moment be filled with acceptance of the fact that life came and now life is leaving?Whether the answer is yes or no doesn't really matter; you don't really have a choice. What does matter is what you do from today onwards to answer that question the way you want. To say you tried, or not."
BOYHOOD,13 February 2015,4/10,"I really had high hopes for this movie, but came away feeling a little cheated. I appreciate that it was filmed with mostly the same cast over a number of years - OK!!! But the story of this young man and his family wasn't really that interesting. I'm shocked that it got Best Picture at the BAFTAS!!!! In fact. I'm surprised it's in the nominations for any major award. The kind of movie that just helps a transatlantic flight go a little quicker!!!! Sorry, I would like to be more generous about this movie! No acting performance of any real note. The movie was too long - I was getting bored after the first hour but stuck with it because I thought it would get meatier. Sadly, it didn't! At the end I felt I got let out from a long bad class at school."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is deserving of it. The plot is not as in depth or thought provoking and it's not one of those films that will BLOW YOU AWAY... but that's EXACTLY why it does anyways... the movie has such a simple premise and plot that it works it's way with it in such UNIQUE AND COMPELLING WAYS. The script is amazing, the acting is amazing, the story is amazing everything about this movie works. I feel as if I was there living through this life with mason it's crazy. I loved BOYHOOD masterpiece and will be talked about many years to come."
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,7/10,"This is a high concept movie. The concept, or conceit, is that it follows the same characters over 12 years. We get to see the people age naturally and the story is thus the development of those characters including especially the titular boy, Mason.When I first read about this I was afraid that the movie itself would be a long and boring rehash of the life, avoiding having to deal with the issues and pains of growing in favor of showing the inevitable march forward. The story, I thought, would need more focus. I was wrong. Linklater has found a way to encompass story and growth and for that I congratulate him. Job well done. The issue then is ""Having met the goal was the total effort a triumph when judged against other film?"" To the extent that most movies have disappointed me recently Linklater succeeds. This is not however a powerful story, nor are the characters remarkable, nor are the portrayals wrenching. Polanski gets more out of 2 people in an otherwise empty theater in his high concept work Venus in Fur. Doubt, a movie from a year or so back, likewise just blows this apart in every dimension. So a good job, a good film, worth the price of admission (which says a lot these days) and a pleasant diversion for its not overlong 2 and a half hours. Truth be told I preferred Linklater's small concept film Bernie."
BOYHOOD,22 April 2016,6/10,"Richard Linklater is a director known for his existentialist dramas and this is one more. The fuss around this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years with the same cast and so we can follow the growth and aging of the characters/actors.What's it about:We are presented to a family headed by a divorced mother (Patricia Arquette, winning the Oscar for Best Performance in a Supporting Role) in charge of her two children Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter). The absent father in redemption is played by Ethan Hawke and so this family struggles to overcome the hardships of life focusing on Mason and his character development as he grows and matures into a calm and clearheaded young man about the time he reaches college. Along the way some particular, familiar and social situations occur which any person can easily relate to, for we all experience that as humans and social beings.Verdict:At the end the movie conveys a sense of sleazy hope in the future (mostly if you're still young, I guess), showing that life goes on. Cool soundtrack.Yet, besides the original concept, it was too much ado about nothing. Just a drama. 6/10"
BOYHOOD,17 May 2020,8/10,"The process of watching the movie was very easy, and it didn't feel like 160 minutes was long. After a long period of time, the trivial fragments in my life accumulated into boyhood, which lasted for 12 years.Two years in a three-hour movie and it's kind of brutal when it comes out. How many times do we see ourselves in those three hours?"
BOYHOOD,18 March 2018,8/10,"It's a very simple movie about the life of a boy from his early childhood to the college days 
There is nothing thrilling in this movie it just show the development of the boy , and I really liked it 
You just feel like you're living with the boy and you watch him grow so fast . I think this movie is very different from other movies , and it's worth watching I want to salute Linklater for this special film"
BOYHOOD,5 December 2014,5/10,"After watching Boyhood, a movie which follows the same children through their entire childhood and into adulthood, I was left with a mixed bag of emotions. One side of me said this was a very long, boring mess. The other side said this was a fantastic film experiment.Boyhood, as a concept, steps into a category of film making which has never been done before. For that -- You have to give the writer/director a huge amount of credit. No one has ever even tried to use the same exact actors over a 12 year period to play the same characters at different stages of their lives. Every other film maker, probably for fears of actor availability and budgets, have used separate actors to play different ages of the same characters. The fact that this could be pulled off all the way to completion with every character in this film 12 years later, made me interested to check it out -- If not for anything else but for it's artistic value. To watch these characters age and develop right in front of your eyes is simply amazing. You have a hard time believing you are witnessing the same actors throughout. By the end of the movie, you almost feel like you know them personally. The problem is, you just don't care.This concept is so intriguing, I am quite sure I'd love to see it again -- In a much more interesting movie. Some people could say the boy's ""life"" was the plot. Others might say that growing up may be what it was about. I definitely remember having some of the same conversations and being in similar situations as a boy. But I also believe I am intelligent enough to figure out a movie's main plot, and if a movie is so 'artsy' that I have to have the purpose of the plot spelled out to me, not only am I not going to get it but neither are most other people.Boyhood is labeled a 'drama,' but there is no drama. There is no real plot. There are no problems to solve, no mystery to figure out, no moral decisions to make, no real exciting plot twists. The movie really isn't about... anything -- Except maybe watching the kids grow up and going through similar situations many of us went through. There is no real redeeming quality about any character in the film. The entire movie is filled with so many people making so many bad decisions, that I had a hard time caring for any of them. The mother makes one wonderful decision about getting her life on track, then continues with horrible decisions about men who all but ruin it for her. The boy gets the opportunity to make decisions which could have horrible effects on his life, but never struggles with any of them. Not only was the opportunity to struggle with with making these decisions lost, but he chooses poorly and receives no consequences for his actions.As the boy and little girl grow up, their characters where likable and cute. By the time they hit 14 and until the end of the film, they were barely tolerable and boring to watch. Maybe that was the point -- Because most people are like that and it reflects real life. But that is also why most deadpan teens with boring personalities and lives are not the plot of 3-hour movies.The characters are refreshing, down to Earth and real. But nobody is going to spend their money and that much time to watch normal. If the point was to have no point, Boyhood certainly achieved that. The whole film had no drama. I did enjoy watching everyone evolve. i just wish they evolved into something interesting."
BOYHOOD,15 July 2014,10/10,"Most people who talk about ""Boyhood"" will discuss its incredible production history, and I will admit, it's a pretty incredible thing. Richard Linklater must have been incredible passionate to convince four actors, a whole crew and a studio to make this film, which documents the growing up of a boy and his family over 12 years. It was shot for 3 days at a time, once a year, and it is a miracle that everyone stuck with it over that period. But the fact that the production stayed together would have been worthless if the film had been a cheesy affair with no substance and all style. Lesser filmmakers would have gone down that route. Thankfully, Linklater is no lesser filmmaker.Due to the fact that it fills so many years into such a short space of time (and 166 minutes is no short movie), the film can often feel like a photo album – a collection of events that documents the passage of time. Most photo albums record the so-called 'important' events in peoples' lives – birthdays, weddings, family gatherings. These are the landmark moments which we take keepsakes of, so that we can look back years later and remember. ""Boyhood"" is not like that, because Linklater is very conscious not to make it cheesy. It's not a Hollywood film, and we don't get any Christmasses or First Kisses, which you'd think were the key moments to record. We actually only get one of Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) birthdays, and I think Linklater does this to make sure that we're not seeing repetitions of life events.What he clocks into is the fact that the events that you remember aren't the 'important' ones, but the random ones that make you laugh or cry. Mason recalls to his father (Ethan Hawke) an event from a young age where he was promised his dad's car – he can remember the event precisely, even whose house they were going to that day. It's not a key event, but it stuck with him. The film's success is in showing you these odd events which give us clear ideas about who these characters that we're seeing develop are, and making you root for their successes.There are so many great points to the film, that I can't focus on anything. Linklater's vision and focus on people is as clear as ever – much like the ""Before"" movies, nothing overwhelming happens, there's no plot twists or surprises, he's just showing you conversations which are fascinating. The acting is great, and you can tell how much these characters have become part of the actors' lives over the 12 year period by how close their relationships are. The script is sharp and extremely funny at times too. Hawke plays the father figure particularly well, giving his children 'the sex chat' and lessons in 'the art of conversation'.I cannot recommend ""Boyhood"" to you enough – it was difficult as it is to keep this review brief. It's a simple masterpiece, but a masterpiece all the same, which is made great by a flawless script, interesting characters and extremely convincing acting. The concept and choice of events ensure that there is at least one moment which every audience member will relate to. Sitting inside the cinema, I could hear people from around the room chuckling to themselves (I did it too), because they've been through what the characters are doing. I'm unbelievably glad that's it's getting the recognition it deserves, and I simply hope that it reaches and touches as many people as it should."
BOYHOOD,7 March 2015,10/10,"This is one of my favorite movies this year, maybe my favorite in a few years. The theme song still rings in my head.The film story is very subtle but very powerful. It is a coming of age film. The story of the new type of split family. It shows the sadness, growth, and change so well.Have you lived in Texas? I think this film somehow really captures the feel of living there! It is different than other places and they capture that in this film.A lot of folks say the film is just a gimmick film but it is a great film with a gimmick in my opinion. I get attached to the characters. I liked the plot. I feel a bit sad looking at the actors, actresses, and director in the after-film media about the film. I think they all got very attached to the the film, the story and maybe each other. Seeing the story of the film, in this case, makes me like it even more."
BOYHOOD,10 June 2015,,BOYHOOD tells the story of Mason Evans JR. when the film opens up he is a young boy just starting grade two. as the film progresses we see him grow into a young man. there is love joy heartbreak and disappointments along the way. and we see him handle each of these in stride. We witness him fall into the confusion of life unsure of what it is he wants to do. But as he grows he learns and by the time the film ends he is still unsure but confident in himself.Having watched the other Best picture contenders Whiplash and birdman. I can honestly say boyhood while quite good is also the weakest of the three. The acting is very good Patrica Arquette and Ethan Hawke have much to be proud of here as they do outstanding work. and the Oscar went to the right Actress as Arquette is the life force of this film. without her it would have been so strong or as powerful.The downside is while the film is powerful and strong it feels overlong and it feels like it wanders all over the place unsure of itself not knowing what to tell next. Linklater needed to rein himself in and did not.By the end of the film you find yourself wondering what is the point ? And that is the point. This is a movie about a boy's life it has no plot. Although it could've benefited better from having a stronger plot and a more coherent storyline. Is it worth viewing I say yes. Is it worth seeing more then once? Well no once you have seen it you see all the film has to offer and in the end it feels unfinished and empty. But I did enjoy it for what it is worth. Linklater set out to tell a unique story and at that he has succeeded. A great film if only to see it once .
BOYHOOD,7 April 2016,7/10,"It is difficult to find any film that has received such rave reviews from – both from the professionals and the movie going public.Boyhood, is a glorified 'Coming of Age' epic. What makes it stand out from most other films is a very clever, unique gimmick. The film spans 12 years in the life of a boy growing up in middle-class, suburban America, and it also took 12 years to make. The long time span of the production enabled the director to use the same actors for the leading parts – namely, mum, dad, sister and – crucially – the boy himself.Every year for 12 years, the actors were called back to the studios to undertake a few more weeks of film shooting.It is very clever and very ambitious. The results of this unique piece of film-making is that we see the real people get older and are not subjected to the usual movie-making devices – such as using different actors to play the same character at different ages and/or using make-up and prosthetics to make actors look older as the film's fictional years progressBut a clever gimmick does not a good movie make.I honestly think that all the reviewers have been so bowled over by this unique, 12- year production time span that they are somehow blinded by the magic of it all. They have failed to look objectively at the real nuts and bolts of what the film is all about. Now don't get me wrong – I'm not saying it is a bad film, I've sat through far, far worse, although it did all but send me to sleep about half way through. For the most part, it managed to hold my attention, but I am quite sure it would have benefited greatly from around having about 30 minutes hacked off its running time. Sadly, it didn't inspire me, amuse me, or inform me and the bottom line is – it failed to really entertain me.We first meet the six-year-old boy when he is growing up with his older sister in a one-parent family, just after his mother has divorced his feckless father. The mother has a series of relationships that don't work out too well and he has a couple of stepfathers that come and go, but it is no big deal. Mum does a pretty good job in raising him and he still maintains a good relationship with his real Dad.His mother becomes a college professor, so although there is an allegedly constant struggle for money, this struggle is somewhat relative. They always live in lovely big homes, they seem to want for nothing and Mum succeeds in putting both of her kids through college without too many sacrifices. Sure he has to wash dishes in his spare time for pocket money, but he still owns a pick-up to get around in, and that's about as far as his 'life struggle' goes. The worst traumas that happen in his life were:1. When mum decides to leave her second husband who is an alcoholic and abusive. 2. When against his better judgement he smokes a joint with friends. 3. When he gets into trouble with his teacher for spending the whole of the photography class in the dark room. 4. When his High school girlfriend of a few weeks decides to dump him.He finally makes it to college, to study for a degree in photography, and the almost 3-hour film ends with our hero wondering what the world is all about and what does it all mean? It's easy for him to share such world-shattering, philosophical angst with his new, very pretty, equally privileged girlfriend. After all, he has never really wanted for nothing, and very probably never will. How boring!Doesn't sound too exciting, does it? It's a middle-class film for middle-class Americans. It probably reinforces their middle class mantra that everything will always turn out right as long as you come from a decent background, get a half way decent education, play by the rules, don't suffer from any physical or mental illness and don't have to fight for your very existence in some deprived ghetto full of gangs and ethnic minorities.There is one revealing, even worrying aspect of contemporary American life that emerges. Throughout the entire movie, the only non-white Americans that we see are the distant backs of a couple of African American football players when our boy hero is sent to take photographs of his high school American football game. It is clear that his entire life exists in a cocoon of white, middle-class America. It is a world where everyone is white – not even the suggestion of a brown skin in sight, except for a single, token Hispanic boy in a school gang that he briefly hangs out with when he was a pre-teenager.If this story was shot in the UK, it would have been completely impossible to film anyone's coming of age in England without involving blacks or Asians, or probably both. But it seems that in America, even in this day and age of so-called racial integration, this is not the case. If the film reflects reality, then it is quite an eye opener. If it doesn't, then why exclude blacks? Either way - very odd.I reiterate – don't get me wrong - it's a very well made film. It is well photographed and very well written and directed by Richard Linklater and all the actors are excellent. I would even go so far as to say that Ethan Hawke deserved a punt at best supporting actor for his portrayal as the boy's good-for-nothing father.Yes, it is a well-produced film, but it is a million miles away from being one of the top ten films of all time - as many would have us believe."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,7/10,"I saw this movie because of all the hype and the unique span of shooting it without knowing much else about it, and while it is pretty fascinating to see the kids grow up in the film and be played by the same people, that's basically all the film has going for it. The story, while not necessarily bad, isn't particularly interesting either. It's just the life of a boy, and many scenes will leave you wondering ""what was the point of showing that?"" since they just show things happening in the boys life, but don't make for a compelling or engrossing storyIt's worth seeing for the novelty of being shot over 12 years, but that's about it."
BOYHOOD,31 July 2020,10/10,"The growth stage, passing through childhood and adolescence, is a stage of discovery. A stage where emotions are lived in a very powerful and intimate way and where moments are as devastating as they are joyful.
In this same way 'Boyhood' is lived. And I say 'live' instead of 'see' because it is more than being a movie, it is an experience. It is a means of transport to that difficult stage of growth that we have all experienced once, although all in a different way. Precisely in this last one is where the magic of that stage and this film resides. Even though we all experience it differently or experience the film differently, each person can have an instant connection to it. 'Boyhood' is the stage of growth envisioned in a way that only cinema could achieve and only Richard Linklater could have performed with such a level of mastery and emotionality, managing to touch the soul and heart of each viewer. That is why this film is a mirror for those who experience it. A mirror that through the life of a boy and his family, any life can be represented, both yours and mine and everyone's.
The best way to appreciate this film is to let it seizes you, letting the moment seizes you."
BOYHOOD,13 October 2017,10/10,"A truly beautiful viewing experience. The story feels very real and that is the films biggest appeal in my opinion. The decision to actually work on the film for 12 years and actors literally growing up on screen worked great. I have heard some people complaining that it is too slow and the character of Mason not being interesting enough. I have to disagree since there are thousands and thousands of people like him out there in the world, a bit gloomy, quiet with an artistic soul and most of them will never get their own story on film and I believe that every single person has a story in them. And that is where Boyhood excels, it brought us a simple story about a boy growing up and nailed all the vital elements without any overblown drama. The film will probably take you down your own memory lane and I am sure every viewer will find something for themselves to identify with. I could not recommend this highly enough. The film is almost 3 hours long and when I finished it I wished it was 5 or 6 hours long. A story for your mind and soul accompanied by the most perfectly chosen soundtrack. The music elevates the film to an even higher level.Thank you Richard Linklater and everyone else involved in the making of Boyhood for reminding us why we love watching films so much."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,3/10,"I never heard of the movie Boyhood until it won a Golden Globe for best picture and was nominated for several Oscars, so I watched the DVD. Movie of the year? The critics must be kidding! I understand the uniqueness of shooting a few scenes every year for 12 years, but the end result should be entertaining. Boyhood is not. I'm a huge Seinfeld fan, the TV sitcom purported to be ""a show about nothing"". In fact, each episode was about something, be it a whale, a puffy shirt or a Chinese restaurant. Boyhood, on the other hand, is REALLY about nothing. It follows a boy slacker from age 5 to 18. The only character who is in any way endearing is his dad, played by Ethan Hawke. I never developed a connection to anyone else in the film. Think of the most boring family you know. Then, imagine sitting on your butt for two and a half hours watching their home videos of the past 12 years. That's Boyhood. Plus, the method by which it was made is its own downfall. There are few logical segues from one choppy scene to the next. You rarely see resolution of various conflicts along the way, as you would in a drama. Instead, you are abruptly hurtled on to the next year for another pointless, often depressing vignette in the lives of a family of losers.Who cares? The only reason I gave Boyhood 3 stars rather than one is the frequent appearance of the awesome GTO that belongs to the film's director and writer, Richard Linklater. That car is the only cool thing about Boyhood. The rest of it should have been left on the cutting room floor. Don't get sucked in by gushing critics, undeserved awards or excessive hype. It's not worth your time."
BOYHOOD,27 March 2015,10/10,"richard linklater, i don't know how he did it, is it he just lucky to create a masterpiece like this ? or maybe he did it for real with genius long-term plan ? why i ask that ? because before boyhood, i never seen any linklater's movies which even reach the level of this masterpiece ! this movie is the future. it is something else that have a genuine beauty inside which only few people in the world can seen it. it is a new-art for the professors of movie. boyhood is a pure- beauty ! i just cant believe it !im just so sad to hear so many bad critics to boyhood. there were a degradation in movie-cinema now, especially since 2005. so many people cant see an art in a movie and they can't appreciate good movies. even now they cant differentiate which one good ones and bad ones.the other things also happen to Oscar. this movie is the only one that deserve a best winning picture of 2014 but it didn't. okay im telling you the actors and actresses not even worth to be nominated. but the movie ? are you serious ? this movie even too far beyond from birdman or whiplash. okay, if we see boyhood in it's entertaining aspect, this movie totally lose because of saturated people's taste in movies nowadays. but as an art ? you joke ? this movie only exist one !! since a word ""movie"" even created in this world !! my conclusion is, judges from Oscar put ""entertaining aspect"" category in their total score to vote best picture of the year.the first scene of boyhood already represent the pure-beauty inside it. a shot when mason lying in the park while staring to the sky. from that first shot, i know this movie will be no shi*. it tells us about life ! there are no acting, there are no plot, there are no climax, no real villain, no protagony. it's all about a story about one human's life in the point of view of himself. can you imagine ? how to create a movie without even one thing exist from what i said before ? it is extremely hard.mason and samantha play the role in boyhood even without any acting. anything they do in the movie is natural. pure from his trait. they just do what they feel should do. samantha also incredible, what an extremely natural performance i had ever seen in my entire life ! this movie keeps flowing and keeps me smiling for more than two hours. when the movie ends im feeling so sad. because why ? because i want to see more !! i want to see more life about mason and samantha !! i want to see their life for the next 20 years, or maybe for the next 40 years until they grow old. i got addiction to them, boyhood successfully did it to me.im not recommend amateur people to watch boyhood, because they will get bored. boyhood only for people who can see what a true movie is. if you are that people, be proud because linklater already made a history in movie cinema since he create a masterpiece called ""BOYHOOD"""
BOYHOOD,3 July 2018,,"It's a beautiful movie. It's a privilege to be drawn in 12 years. It was so beautiful to see it. It's a different experiment. Although it lasted for 2 hours and 40 minutes and went to an ordinary drama consistency, it was not boring. It was even fun and nice. It's a long film I wonder. I did not regret it. The characters could not be emphasized much. Apart from that everything was nice."
BOYHOOD,9 June 2020,9/10,"This was a movie following the lives of average people. The boy & the mom were definitely The center of the story. The boy grows up in a low income family & goes through moments of both hardship & levity as develops from a child to a young adult. And the Mom struggled to raise her children as she made both right & wrong life decisions. I related much to the boy as I had a similar childhood as well, from divorced parents to living as a low class family. As a kid you never realize how hard your parents work to make your life as comfortable as possible. The dad was always there to have fun & be there as a friend & father to his kids & never abandoned them no matter where they were. And the Mom went back to college to earn a degree & get a good job so she can support the family.The best line in the film was the Mom's final line: ""I thought there'd be more."" It's heartbreaking, but that's the truth about life. Life is a regular event. We spend so many years living just to die. Another reason why this line was so good because it's paired with two other moments that tie together the meaning of the film. Before the line, Mason asks his father what the point was on living, & his father responded that we were all just winging it. And in the final scene the dance teacher says ""the moment seizes you."" You watch this 3 hour film that documents regular events of life for 12 years through the eyes of a child. And in the end this child questions what ""why"" and answer is ""that's just how it is.""This was a great movie to watch at least once. The pacing isn't too bad and story was relatable. The adults of this movie always gave solid performances. There were a handful of years where the kids just didn't seem into it & weren't really good at acting, sometimes it was awkward & stale, but that was probably to be expected since they spent their entire childhood filming & got tired of it after a while. But overall they didn't do too bad. The music was also good & paired with the story nicely. And there were a few moments, especially in the end, that got me choked up. Those little moments just ""seized"" me I guess."
BOYHOOD,3 October 2015,2/10,"I suppose it is remarkable to follow a young boy from ages 6-18 in a nearly 3 hour movie if the character has some sort of personality! Ellar Coltrane plays Mason, Jr. and he grows from a likable, engaging 6-year-old to a moody, rather boring 18-year-old. I liked Mason from ages 6-11 1/2 and then he turned 12 and left childhood for adolescence and I lost interest. Mason never had any sort of interests, dreams, fears or desires. He rarely said anything interesting or thought-provoking unlike Anne Frank. When she kept her diary for 2 years under the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne expressed her thoughts and dreams in full detail. You learned about the things she loved, the things she hated, what drove her and what frightened her. She was an open book. Mason, on the other hand was a book placed on a pile of other books and burned so no one could read him! Mason's parents (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) and sister Samantha (Lorelei Linkletter) had more personality than this sad sack son and brother of theirs. His mother and father were divorced. Mason, Sr. was a musician who was interested in current events, while his mother Olivia went to college part time to improve their lot in life. Both parents seemed like decent people, except for one fault of Olivia's: she married horrible drunks who mistreated her, her children, and stepchildren. It is a rather ambitious project to film a child during his or her formative years to young adulthood. I give the movie creators points for this and originality as well. The person being filmed should be someone you care about and are invested in. Mason doesn't do this for the viewer, unfortunately! Anne Frank made the reader care for her and her predicament and I guess the popularity of ""Full House"" came about because people wanted to watch a baby grow and develop realistically into a child. Michelle wasn't an infant one season and suddenly 3-years-old the next."
BOYHOOD,29 February 2016,2/10,"I've been wanting to see this film every since it won all kinds of accolades, Oscar bows and such but didn't want to pay as much it would cost me online. So, i , finally picked it up at the video store still skeptical it would be good. But, 'everyone says it's good'! Wow, i forced myself to watch it. I'm just not going to go into why it's lousy because those that ranked it low do a better job of describing why this flick is a waste of my time. 'Short Term 12' , i think , was awesome. 'Boyhood' stinks. The acting was OK but there's nothing in the goings-on that holds my attention, no real tension, no revelation, stale excerpts from any average person's life. Everything about it is 'short of the mark'. About 1 hour into the film i thought 'this film would be a good film would be good to play, in serial form, in a middle school classroom. Some 5th graders would like it. But, even they would yawn. And, the whole darn film 'talked down to me' with such snobbish tone. There isn't a thing in the show that's not trite. That's about it for me."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,7/10,"This is a Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke project that spans about 15 years. It revolves around typical, by today's standards family and their trials and tribulation during this 15 year period of time. Seems like a simple plot and it is. The catch is that all the actors, which also include Patricia Arquette don't have any makeup on them to show they've aged. This is because they have actually aged. They didn't get other actors to play the two kids as they grow up, they just used the kids. What they did is, I am guessing, get back together every year or so and film a bunch of stuff and turned it all into a movie and you actually see the actors grow up and get old. Patricia Arquette actually has gained a little weight and Ethan Hawke has actual got gray hair. Man, I have to say, it is one of the most daring projects I have ever seen. I appreciate the dedication by everyone involved. Now to play devil's advocate, the couple of complaints I have about it are, it was a little to long. Maybe I would not have been able to choose the appropriate scenes to take out, but there were a few that went nowhere. This is a complaint I have about most movies. I think a director should think very hard before they make a movie that's longer than two hours. I was in the restroom after the movie and heard to ladies say something like it didn't really have a plot or something. I was thinking, what they are trying to say is there is no defined story arc to it. Not that this is necessary in movies, but without it a movie can go nowhere and become a bit dull. I give this A plus for creativity, but not as high a score for actual entertainment value."
BOYHOOD,22 September 2014,7/10,"Richard Linklater started a project in between the ""before"" series that most of directors are either incapable, or have no patience to do. He decided to film a life of one family, in particular a member of this family Mason (Ellar Coltrane) through 12 years until his young adulthood. More amazingly, he did not change any of actors, instead filmed different scenes of movie year by year, so that every actor grew old naturally in the film. The concept of Boyhood is similar to Linklater's acknowledged trilogy which also follows a couple through 18 years, visiting them in every 9 years. Here, instead, film is done as a one (damn) long story skipping from year to year and transforming to a later periods quite quickly. Having brought an impressive cast of Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and his own daughter Lorelei Linklater, Richard created an realistic journey with Mason, his sister Samantha and mom.First, we are introduced to this small family of three, where mother (Arquette) is divorced and still tries to partner with the guy taking care of her children. This unsuccessful attempt results in those three departing to another city to make it work better. The next guy turns out to be tyrant, beating his wife and abusing children. So, this story also has no happy ending. While they are struggling, kids' father and ex-husband of Patricia's character - Ethan Hawke - is living his life, seeing children on weekends and holidays and doing the best of him to be a dad. Film feels extremely natural, as if you are looking at real life of real people. The fact that actors grow up, get old and progress through one movie and you know that this is not fake, makeup or special effects, just aggravates sense of reality. On the other hand, it sometimes gets as boring as the lives of others (and ours too). Regardless all the good stuff I'm gonna say below, Boyhood sometimes felt a little long (it's 165 minutes) and hard to follow.Because the plot stays as close to real life as possible, it feels extremely natural, but dialogs sometimes lack wittiness and sharpness - what I mostly love in good screenplays. As mentioned above, film sometimes is not easy to catch up, I even replied some of tweets in the first half. The second one was a lot better and interesting because it mostly focuses on Mason's personal life, his challenges and growing up problems. I found his transition from child to teenager very interesting. But the first half was kind of something I've seen in number of movies. Having said that, I believe movie could have been a little shorter. Now, Boyhood takes its time to settle down and bring all those tiny stories to one scope.Linklater did a great job in showing us they way we all grew up, things we don't remember or our mind refuses to remember. In the beginning, we all are like passengers, just like Mason, who has to follow adults, mom, dad, older sister. Then we start to grow up and see the world from different point of view - ours and we no longer are wishing to follow others because we already figured out how things work out there.Boyhood is a good film because of it's amazing cast. Ellan Contrane delivers all touching performances at any age, but especially to the end of the film. Patricia Arquette is also seriously good playing his mother, delivering emotional, devastating performance. The rest of cast, including Hawke is as good as the film itself.In conclusions, Boyhood is the most original film so far, with very interesting mission and pretty impressive execution. If think that you will see Mason's emotional ups and downs here, you will be disappointed. Instead, it demonstrates very average life of average child. So, get prepared, you sometimes can get too excited or bored. But it is life - any of us could have dealt with it before.Oscar chances: I'm sure it grabs couple of nominations, including writing and best picture. Not sure yet about directing or supporting actress bid for Arquette, but it is deserving in both categories. However, I doubt it actually wins best picture. It's too experimental and ""not important"" for that title."
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,9/10,"This film, as it's well known by now, was made over twelve years of shooting intervals, following the life, growth and social milieu of a young kid growing up, moving about from household to household, enduring a broken home, meeting girls, and watching life and society grow and change.The film gives such a realistic, moving portrayal of modern life that it doesn't really do it justice to describe its strength in print, other than that you become aware after seeing the film that the modern corporate style of Hollywood filmmaking is so inured in craft and artifice that it just evinces a kind of soaring, false sentimentality, whereas Linklater's film takes you genuinely into and with its main characters, both in a narrative sense, and as a style of filmmaking.The movie actually feels slightly adrift, yet still complete at the end of the narrative arc, as if the protagonist has moved onto a new phase of life, physically and developmentally but there's a sense of lingering trauma from a less-than-perfect childhood.An excellent film, probably the only of its kind. Funny, revealing, social realist cinema with first rate acting and great direction."
BOYHOOD,15 September 2014,8/10,"I was drawn to this film for the story, behind it,...12 years on the making, then Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, but beyond their acting it's the way this film becomes captivating, and realistic, in one way or another, I saw myself, friends, mothers and fathers, and I felt like touching present and past... Do I need to say more?.I just hope this film gets to be appreciated and an Oscar, would be in order and ""Boyhood"" certainly will have a place among my favorite movies and list of recommendations! Ellar Coltrane, is a young talented actor and I will be looking forward for his next film.I could not say that I agree with every event this movie presents, but in these times, when so much FX and super-heroes and shootings, a movie like this is something I really liked, but in fairness, I have to add, this is not a movie for everyone."
BOYHOOD,4 February 2015,2/10,"Director Richard Linklater definitely deserves kudos for ambition and tenacity. For his cinematic experiment Boyhood, he filmed sporadically over the course of a 12-year period with the same cast, to give the authentic feel of watching his central character, played by Ellar Coltrane, grow from a boy to a young man. And every critic and high-minded movie goer will hammer home to you how impressive that is and heap superlatives on it.Unfortunately, Linklater forgot to write a compelling central character or a story. What we end up with is something that sounds potentially interesting on paper, but plays like an unendurable home movie of a bunch of strangers - the kind that no one should have to pay money to see. What is infuriating is watching so many critics and movie elites who have insisted on a strong story and characters in the past, now proclaim that these are apparently no longer important because...well, 12 years! What we get in place of a story are a jumble of scenes that do not particularly connect or add up to much of anything for a self-indulgent three hour running time. Tellingly, if you removed any random dozen scenes from anywhere in the film, it would not impact it at all because most of the scenes (if not all of them) are pointless if narrative is your thing. For instance, we get a scene where some bullies confront the central character of Mason in the bathroom. We have no prior scenes which tell us to expect this,the scene itself goes no where and has no impact on the rest of the film, and the following scenes do not reference it at all. Similarly, a scene where the mother (Patricia Arquette) chastises her daughter for forgetting to pick Mason up at school has no point. Nothing happens because of this oversight - it is just there. We get another scene set inside an abandoned house with Mason and his friends/acquaintances. We wait for something important to happen or be said...nothing does. In fact, Mason is silent throughout the scene. We get another scene of someone bouncing a ball that goes no where. Scenes of people playing video games or just walking. All of this adds up to...nothing.Not everyone's life is fascinating enough to be turned into a movie, and this experiment proves it. By the conclusion, Mason is largely a passive cipher about whom we still know little and really do not want to know more. Coltrane's performance is nothing special, but neither is the character he is playing. Arquette and Ethan Hawke, as Mason's sweet errant dad, are better than what they are handed, but that is as good as the acting gets in this film. One scene between Mason and a teacher features hands down the worst acting of the year. Linklater seems to be trying to make a ""documentary"" that really is not a documentary. Yet any good documentary still takes on some narrative point in the editing process. There really seems to be no point to Boyhood other than getting a cliff notes version of the passage to young adulthood of a charmless, incredibly forgettable boy - and if the cliff notes version included every pointless passage while omitting anything of interest. We get no real insight into Mason or have any idea as to what his hopes, dreams or ultimate goals in life are. Does he even have them? Why are we spending three hours with him? The film certainly gives us no compelling reason. The film plays like being trapped in a room with an elderly person suffering from dementia who wants to incessantly babble about their youth, but only remembers the inconsequential boring parts of it.So we have a film with an incredibly weak and uninteresting central character and a lack of story made up of completely random, disconnected scenes that go no where for three tortuous hours, and it has absolutely nothing of importance to say. It is less a faux documentary and more the cinematic equivalent of crashing a teenage stranger's Facebook page and staring at it for three hours, which might be only slightly more fascinating than the end result here. But apparently all must be forgiven because...12 YEARS! You know, 12 YEARS! It MUST be a masterpiece because of 12 YEARS! 12 YEARS, I say! Who needs an interesting story, or strong characters, or excitement, when you have the ""realism"" of 12 YEARS!"
BOYHOOD,8 August 2014,10/10,"Roger Ebert once wrote that he walked out of ALMOST FAMOUS wanting to hug himself. I emerged from a screening of BOYHOOD wanting to embrace everyone I know or have known. I also wanted to hug the makers of the film for creating an experience so rich and textured as to renew one's faith in cinema.I believe that all art is, in some sense, autobiographical. Not in the sense that it reproduces or even re-contextualizes moments or facets in the life of the artists, but rather that the art (art worth discussing, at least) expresses something about the artist's sensibility and ethos. In that sense, BOYHOOD is a pure expression of the heart, mind, and soul of Richard Linklater. His reputation casts him as the most philosophically and romantically loquacious of a certain generation of indie auteurs; BOYHOOD reveals him to be the best American cinematic humanist currently going. This is his benediction.The audacity on display here is both self-evident and not. Aside from the logistical headaches and sheer risks of the design of the film, the decision to root it so firmly in its own time and place could threaten the power of the universal moments. And yet, both exist harmoniously. Mason, Samantha, Olivia, and Mason Sr. are at once our on-screen avatars making it day to day through life and thoroughly interesting, developed characters worth investing in. Coltrane is a real find and hardly a moment of his work here feels remotely coached or false. Frequent Linklater collaborator Hawke has tended to seem slightly over-matched in past Linklater films (particularly BEFORE SUNRISE) but here he sketches Mason Sr.'s gains and loses vividly. Arquette too easily slides into the role as a thoughtful, well-educated woman trying to honor her evolving vision of herself and how to best raise her children.The pace really sings on a second viewing, as the film relaxes into its own grooves and rhythms. The narrative strategies evolve in tandem with Mason's own understanding of his world. Perhaps it isn't the masterpiece that many are proclaiming it to be. It has some rough edges that are unavoidable with an unabashedly curious Linklater at the helm. Instead, it's something much better. This review (such as it is) began with a personal admission and that is what this film inspires. It reaches deep within us, maybe even deeper than critical inquiry, and dredges up some vivid emotional sensations. It's a beguiling treasure of a movie."
BOYHOOD,8 February 2015,5/10,"I was very excited to finally see Boyhood on DVD as I had missed it in the theaters. All I had heard before seeing it was the daring and ambitious undertaking by director Richard Linklater to film the movie over a 12 year span using the same main actors throughout. And there were rave reviews. Lots of them.OK, I do not get it.While the acting and cinematography are good, the plot is basically non-existent other than the passage of time among the family. There is basically no conflict (a few abusive husbands but even that is passed over quickly). The children hardly even roll their eyes at their mother let alone rebel or act like real teenagers. They simply grow up.Sure it is an nice character study but none of the characters have any real depth worth watching - just average teenagers and a single mom going through life. No surprises occur. I do not think I needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to see that. I get that the revolutionary concept of the long shoot was risky, but I cannot say it added any value. Of course there are those out there who will appreciate the ""art of it all"" but I am not one. I have liked many of Mr. Linklater's other films and hope that his future films no longer indulge in what essentially amounts to a gimmick.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com"
BOYHOOD,5 March 2018,9/10,"This is totally my kind of film. I am not into films with complicated stories or a lot of action. I am all about the feelings and experiences. Although I will not put any spoilers in my review, that really would not have made any difference, because I could tell you what actually happens in the film in two sentences. It's not about that. It's about a boy noticing a guy is not as great as he seems before anyone else, or how he notices that his mother is meeting someone new at a party, just from looking at their conversation from a distance. My parents never divorced, so I wouldn't know what that is like, but I think that despite all the problems, it seems like in the end there is some sort of a tight-knit family, even though everybody has moved on.I really like Ethan Hawke in this as well. Great acting."
BOYHOOD,18 July 2020,6/10,"Nothing new here,a bit long film with good and dull moments.
Nice movie but lacks a lot of things to become very good.
A mediocre Linklater."
BOYHOOD,6 March 2015,1/10,"As many have said, it is the un-eventual life of a person, much like The Truman Show which made fun on the reality TV, this basically wants to be The Truman Show. Obviously this doesn't really work because you see his 12 years in the 3 hours, if they made a TV show about the main character it would have most likely never lasted 12 years, but then again people watch all kind of reality TV.For me it did nothing and I stopped watching after the first 20 or so minutes and just skipped through until the end.People called it LIFE, great but I rather watch The Goldbergs for that at least it is funny and funny enough being a child of the 80's I can relate to it."
BOYHOOD,25 March 2020,8/10,"Looking at the 12 years of shooting, once everything is added to the brewing of time, it will start to smell. Like Seven, who has heard the name but has not yet begun to appreciate it, it is worth boasting that it can persist for 49 years. The parents of 12 years are short, have unsuccessful marriages, and have rebellions that are not extreme conflicts. Maybe this is life. Watching the movie, suddenly there are some fragments of the once life, the dreams or wishes of the past. Face bravely now."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,9/10,"The plot of this film is rather mundane. We've seen ""growing up"" pictures before, of course, but the unique spin here is that the same actors are playing the same roles over the entire period of ""growing up"". And because of this, the viewer's sympathies and empathies increase as the film progresses. By the end of the film, you truly know who these people are, and feel as if you know them much, much better, because you have literally seen them developing over a long period of time. Patricia Arquette's performance is sterling! It is rich, layered, and real. We see her as mother, as wife, and as woman. It is truly an interesting span and brilliant revelation of character development, and we get to see these revelations of character at specific times in her life--not all at once, but over time, which seems so real. Her character opens like a flower.And Ethan Hawke is magnificent in the role of the father. The development of his character also progresses in stages as his life unfolds around him, and we see a truly rounded individual by the film's end. I loved Ellar Coltrane, because he gave such a true performance in this film. He seems to be truly living the role, and his character is wonderfully passive in its development. Very true to life, I believe. You can feel that outside-of-life- looking-at-life point of view of a young man as he matures. While others grasp and try to make things happen, Mason, Jr. is the true kid growing up, trying to make sense of the world but because he is young cannot force issues. There are some truly harrowing family scenes depicted, and there is a moment at the very end of the film when Mason, Jr. looks directly into the camera for an instant that is soul-piercing. One might think this momentary look into the camera breaks the 4th wall, but indeed it does not. It's an admission of the fact that we have been there all along watching this young man grow up. He is acknowledging our presence in his life. It completes the artistic vision of this film wonderfully."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2014,10/10,"The mundane and commonplace premise of the ""typical circumstances"" of growing up actually rebels from traditional film formula in two major ways. Thus the mundane premise becomes one of the most profound meditations on film and the meaning of life ever made. The rebellious nature of this film is subtle. We are accustomed to films that usually utilize a formula. This formula trains us as viewers to expect a climax, a tragedy, a sudden dramatic element. This film frees itself from this formula and opens our ingrained and adapted film mind. Scenes purposefully made to cause our mind to anticipate the typical and necessary dramatic moment, instead, innovatively ""back off"" from the drama or edge, these scenes prevent immediate drama to happen, and let in a more likely, believable reality to surface. This passing over of the immediate drama, creating a reality (because for much of us reality is dramatic but not film dramatic), gives us something surprisingly more interesting and profound. So this innovative feature of holding off on the drama is both a rebellion and a commentary on traditional film, (the commentary that films don't need the dramatic element to be profound. Immediate drama is not necessary to draw an audience in ). The result is a refreshing and believable slice of reality over 12 years.It is a slice of real life about a boy growing up. Almost as relevant as the boy is the family saga. The mother, the father and the sister are all part of this showcase of human development and change.The second great innovation is the well done psychological and physical human development played out on screen in one 3 hour film sitting. Physical development is witnessed over 12 years as we see the characters actually age and grow simultaneously with the actors. We see the children develop into adults and the adults physically alter to middle age.Even more than the physical, the psychological/cognitive development reflect the appropriate stage that the boy is in. In the beginning, when the boy is very young, things take on a very sensory perspective. Things are unclear and if something confusing for a young boy is introduced it is almost passed over without much thought or much dialogue. The dialogue and thought processes going on at this age are completely appropriate for that stage of life. As the boy develops into different stages, his psychological mind develops to a more intuitive nature, he becomes more intellectually and emotionally curious about the people in his life. He eventually becomes a teenager and in this most interesting stage, he develops his own soul. As a teenager his words and perspectives create a more individualistically philosophical being. There is more dialogue reflecting a more nuanced detailed thought process that appropriately coincide with a more matured stage of boyhood. It was quite a remarkable feat to witness this progression of the different stages of childhood over a 3 hour period. We were able to see how various influences and people in his life perhaps formed this boy's soul and personality. He isn't someone incredibly shocking or magnificently great or terrible he was just idiosyncratically normal. He was his own unique individual which is the most normal and realistic thing a character can be.The family developed too and it was mesmerizing to see their changes as well as the boy's throughout the years. Thus a slice of life tale about a more or less normal boy growing up ultimately became that movie that asks the biggest most interesting questions. It asks the deep philosophical questions, about time, about our place in the world and the meaning of life. Even the most grand questions of all is asked – whether to be or not to be on Facebook. Finally in the last moments of this film we are granted an answer to these deep, grandiose questions."
BOYHOOD,26 August 2014,9/10,"Theme: teen boy coming of age, single motherhood, 90's generation teen angst that is still relevant today.It's a relate-able story consists of snapshots of key life moments. How a boy copes even as his little world seems to constantly fall apart as his mother struggles to grow herself up. Nothing earth-shattering kind of childhood trauma or shocking life events, just something most human beings can relate to even if you have different kind of parents and family or cultural background. A lot of heart. And humor too.Ethan Hawke still refuses to stop acting hot and sexy and insists on looking very perky at older age, but because he's so giving in this story I let that pass. Patricia was self-consciously posing for the camera at the beginning but got really natural as the story progresses in time, relaxes more as she ages. The two kids were just....great.Love the way the movie ends too. I was so scared the director-writer is going to go contrive and pretentious and sentimental BS at the finale scene...but he didn't. So relieved.My only 'issues' - it's actually not necessary to cast the same child actors and film the whole thing over so many years. The actor continuity process thing is kind of gimmicky to be honest. The story is meaningful and engaging enough to stand on its own. I also wish the sister got more limelight. Casting decision is not perfect: an 18 yo guy like Mason would not easily get girls that hot just because he talks so deep and profound. I'm however cool with the meandering narrative style. I didn't know Richard Linklater also directed one of my fav film, School of Rock. Definitely like his approach: naturalistic, spontaneous, expressive, yet still highly concise pacing. His directing and camera work is so anonymous too, thus allowed actors to do their stuff without the typical hyper-composed Hollywoodized tone and manners. The overall mood is so fresh and ""normal"" the film feels almost European...Overall, it is really ""just"" a simple yet emotive story, well told. In these day and age, to have told a story packed with real authentic emotion and meaning and soul without going sentimental or didactic is so so so rare and precious.The film was almost 3 hours long yet I didn't notice it. It's the kind of stories that should be told more often. Highly recommended for any age group and gender and occasions."
BOYHOOD,25 August 2020,1/10,"I wish I could give the movie credit for taking 12 years to be shot but apparently they relied on that fact alone to carry the whole movie. That was it. There is no plot. There is no story. The main character is sooooo boring to watch. This felt more like a documentary but with no purpose. Like ""Oh, look, we'll just take this kid and we'll film his life for the next 12 years and then put it in a movie"" but then nothing actually happens to that guy. He goes to school, gets a girlfriend, breaks up with her, he has a mom and a dad, then a couple step dads, and then he graduates HS and goes off to college. End of the movie. That's it you people!!!! Who in their right mind thought that this storyline would make for a good movie?! Lots of movies feature the main character over long periods of time - 10, 20, 40 years sometime. That can't be your whole plot. Hello?? I mean, if the acting was amazing I could maybe watch it but nope.Speaking of acting, what I hated the most about this movie was just the absolute lame acting of the Mason guy. He's just sooooo not worthy of any screen time. The emo thing is NOT interesting. Slow talking and moving is cool in a yoga class. Not on the screen.Basically, this was just a bunch of totally random scenes depicting a totally average and boring human experience and put together in a 3 hour movie for aliens to watch and educate themselves about the most boring human experience of the most average Americans ever.Ugh. I'm sorry. I want my 3 hours back!!!"
BOYHOOD,30 May 2018,2/10,"My biggest focus in a film tends to be the characters and interactions, and that is a huge problem in this film, and a big reason why I don't tend to like gimmick films in general. This film seems to be more infatuated with its gimmick than telling an intriguing story.Production started from 2002 and finished in 2013, and covers a family, focusing on a boy named Mason as he grows up. Reportedly, the script hadn't been completed by the time filming started beyond basic plot points and an ending, and it unfortunately shows badly in the final product. The most basic elements of storytelling are blatantly mishandled as the film chugs along at a snail's pace through its nearly three hour runtime seeming to make things up as it goes, which is likely what happened given the gimmick. It's essentially a slice of life story with a few plot devices placed to try to give the film some narrative to follow. It doesn't push any boundaries or try to be creative in any way other than in taking ten years to film, which is hardly a matter of talent rather than one of patience.The film starts off with its strongest conflicts right at the start, as the mother, Olivia, is recently divorced and falls for her teacher, Bill, who becomes an abusive alcoholic. This feels like one of the few elements that was placed in the story from the beginning, but even it didn't grip me. I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father, and Marco Perella's performance as Bill didn't convince me, as the subtleties seemed off. While it seemed right on paper, the execution felt like he was saying his lines off a teleprompter. Anyways, the movie shortly moves past that and goes on to focus on the family as Mason and Samantha who are now in high school, and it's nothing we haven't seen a million times before, and experienced at some point in our lives, which I suppose is the point, but it seems counter-intuitive to go to the movies to experience the worst part of your life over again. As Mason grows up throughout the movie, I find him less and less likeable as he gets extremely pretentious and depressing, to which point I agree with all those who antagonize him and call him out on his teenage melodrama. Samantha is not much better as she is unreasonably rude to her mother, who is by far the most likeable character in the entire movie. Mason Sr. is alright, and he gets a nice positive arc from being a loser to getting his life together and being a more active father throughout their lives, but I don't feel Mason Jr. quite follows along the same lines. He's simply not matured by the end of the film and it left me very disappointed. The real climax of the film involves Olivia having a mental breakdown about how her life has turned out, and it's actually quite effective, but short-lived, as the movie feels it more important to end with an artsy-fartsy yet cliche scene with teens blabbing about life while watching the sunset at the beach. Seriously, teenagers are just awful.In other words, this film is basically my life with a whole lot less conflict and an even worse teenager than myself. If this concept had worked out to make an entertaining film, it would have been an incredibly lucky lightning in a bottle scenario, and unfortunately that didn't happen. The family didn't have much chemistry, and the children didn't grow into as strong of actors as the parents were from the start. I understand the attempt at becoming a cultural phenomenon, but the excruciating runtime is ultimately undeserved. It can be an interesting diversion for some people, but I'm not entirely surprised it didn't resonate as well as may have been expected through its lengthy production."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,9/10,"Boyhood is a film about mason's life from age 5 to 18. This film took 12 years to make, director Richard Linklater did such an amazing job of showing an 5 years into an 18 year old. The film is almost three hours long and for a drama it's very slow but if you can handle that long,you can enjoy this work of art. Every actor in this film did a great job. The two who stand out are Ellar Coltrane(mason) and Patrica Arquette(mom). It's pretty special to see all this happen. Boyhood definitely Deserves to win awards. Overall boyhood is a work of art,no other movie has been made like this. A must watch(run time 2 hours and 45 minutes)"
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,3/10,"I watched Boyhood last night after hearing all the praise it received both at the Golden Globes and all the Oscar nominations. I have to say, it might be the most disappointed I've been after watching a movie. I expected greatness, a story that would move me, a movie that would be must see. Instead, I got bored, annoyed and overall tired of Richard Linklater's exercise of self- indulgence over a 12 year period of time.The movie is set in Texas, between Houston and Austin, and follows the growth of Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) from a six year old kid to an 18 year old adult. Unlike most movies that use makeup and special effects to ""age"" the actors, this one was filmed over a 12 year period, with filming done over one week each year over the 12 years. A very creative and ambitious idea that falls flat for a couple of key reasons.The film only has three other major characters outside Mason: Patricia Arquette plays Olivia Evans, a stressed out single mother who wants to become a college professor who has a weakness in picking bad men to date. Ethan Hawke plays Mason Evans Sr, a liberal ""Disneyland Dad"" who gets to see his kids once in a while and struggles holding down a job and becoming an adult. Richard Linklater's daughter Lorelei plays Mason Jr's older sister Samantha. Other characters, such as friends, family members, ex-husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc. are scattered throughout the movie, but this is the main core. Arquette and Hawke both play their roles as flawed, but loving parents very well. As Olivia, Arquette always seems to be at wit's end with her life, not afraid to show emotion towards her family about the poor decisions she has made. As she climbs up in her career, her dating decisions keep causing the family to stumble, forcing them to move regularly after another breakup or divorce. Hawke's Mason Sr is a charming slacker with a big heart, a guy who struggles growing up. Eventually, he remarries, has another baby, becomes responsible, and with his new family turns into the father figure that Mason Jr and Samantha always wanted instead of the ""buddy"" he always treated them as. Arquette and Hawke are two of the bright spots in this film. They show emotion, they show some evolution from the beginning, and they prove while they are flawed, they love their kids. That those two were the only bright spots is where the major issue lies. The actors playing Mason Jr. and Samantha just didn't do it for me. You see almost no emotion from them, they are just... there. That's one of the biggest flaws in this film. There is almost no character development. On top of that, there is little to no plot. Something happens, and then we never hear of it again. Nothing connects anything. It feels like 165 minutes of vignettes with no payoff. It makes you ask the question what's the point?That this film was thought of as Oscar worthy is astounding."
BOYHOOD,10 April 2015,8/10,"It's warm, caring and a very close look at how our view of families has changed in the 21st century. Meticulous in attention to the smallest detail. The continuity over he 12 year shooting span is nothing short of breathtaking. Little things are well noted, right down to the exterior paint colors on the various houses they live in. Really, quite amazing.I was glad to see a film that honestly focuses on the splintering of modern families. Parents divorce or split. They love their children but repeatedly fail in giving them the personal attention and time they deserve. Love is like an egg carton of designated visit times as if children lived in a sort of assisted living facility. The parents lives very separate from the children.Kids are moved from place to place, apartment to apartment. Taken on weekend trips to visit so called step relatives they have no life connection with. Boyfriends, girl friends, spouses and blended families come and go. In this regard it truly is a fine, fine film.My only qualification would be that some of the reaction dialog in some scenes is way over the top. There's some serious scene chewing in the bowling alley scenes that are almost vaudevillian in tone. The movie was shot over about a 12 year period starting in 2002. It's a bit of a gimmick. I give credit, it was a grand experiment, but hardly necessary really. Frankly, I would rather they cast different actors at different ages and let me have this great show a lot sooner. Having said that, I would ask myself if it would have been the same movie. Probably not, but I don't think I could have enjoyed it any less. It's like waiting 20 years for a director to finish Gone With The Wind just see if it could be done.Last I checked this wonderful film representing a generation of labor had grossed about $45 million. Magic Mike, IMHO a worthless piece of junk booked three times that and engendered a (horrible) sequel. These numbers if life were fair should have been reversed. But life isn't fair. People will buy heavily into cinematic garbage. And like the kids in this movie, they often get passed over.Just see it if you haven't already."
BOYHOOD,27 December 2018,,"The one thing that I can say about Boyhood is that people love to hate this film. Well, from it being completely offensive, to un-relatable because of the white version of childhood, to being extremely boring to some, I could not help but disagree with those of you completely.Boyhood is a film that has impacted me in a variety of ways because of its superb and complex take on the transition from not only boyhood to manhood, but from childhood to adulthood. Filmed over a span of twelve years, these actors did an incredible job in giving a realistic portrayal of a difficult family dynamic, from the single parents, to the abusive stepdads, to the sibling rivalries, to the passing fads, to the peer pressure, and so much more.I love Boyhood because it is so relevant to my life. I am the boy in this film. I grew up very similarly to the way he did, and I think the latter half of the film (despite me being a senior in college) is where I am headed. As his potential new girlfriend tells him,""You know how everyone's always saying, seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around. You know, like, the moment seizes us.""I actually think that I am at a current point in my life where moments are literally starting to seize my life, and I have not been taking advantage of them until now. And because I am seizing these moments, my life feels much more special and genuine. I have a purpose and I might have the ability to be happy.All in all, the second half of this film is not as great as the first half for me, because I have lived through and experienced everything in the first part. Ironically, I am experiencing that latter half a little late in my life, and perhaps that's why its ambiguity is not something I'm quite comfortable with, but its also something I have to accept and be happy with. I think if I were to rewatch this film in two years, my life will encapsulate all of this.As for some complaints, Linklater does get a little insistent on those philosophical conversations in the latter half of the film. It is annoying, kind of off-putting, and slightly unrealistic. Also, I find the second husband that the mother has to be really underdeveloped and happens a lot more quickly than with the first one she had.Anyways, Ethan Hawke is babe, and this movie is life, literally."
BOYHOOD,17 July 2014,,"Boyhood begins with a flourish - two extra sweet kids with big personalities in a typical American household of the 21st century (ish!). We are introduced to Mason and his sister and everything about them is cute, open and what you would expect from children of their age but with something special too. There is promise in this film - funny family episodes, great acting from Arquette and Hawke plus cameos from a variety of interesting people. We see the kids get older and various traumas occur from the Mother's poor choices in men and parenting - as Mason reaches about 15 years old, the film suddenly gets very stale and very boring. He is no longer cute - but that does not matter if only the director could have got something out of him that was not a monotone of dialogue that has been imbued with the dull monotony of the brain dumb video game generation - something really happens to those kids - they become robotic and that goes for his sister too. Feel very sad to see it - all the personality goes out of these kids from too much computer deadening. That would not matter so much if only Linklater could have followed up perhaps even a 10th of the story lines - so many people left to wander away and no one knows anything about them and the effect on the kids. I mean the mother has a life changing relationship with an alcoholic university professor with two kids that are obviously bonded with Mason and his sister - they spend some years living together - the impact of this split is left high and dry. The film goes on for about 1 hour and 40 mins too long and the aspects of Mason's story that are brought out from the director in these long winded and terribly slow agonising (can't wait to leave the cinema) minutes are very boring. Sadly I left the movie not caring two hoots about Mason and that seemed a waste to me."
BOYHOOD,14 September 2014,10/10,"On first glance, Richard Linklater's Boyhood might not even sound like it is anything special: just a film about a boy growing up. We've seen plenty of movies like that before, but when you discover just how they made Boyhood, it makes the film even more special. Boyhood is like no film I've ever seen before, and not because of the story, but its conception. Boyhood was shot over a 12 year period, with the same actors. No kidding. The film is actually the most realistic portrayal of child to adult that I've ever seen. Boyhood isn't just a great film, it's also a great experience. Boyhood is literally life on film.Filmed over exactly twelve years and forty five days, Boyhood is told through the eyes of a young boy named Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane). Boyhood follows Mason through various sequences of childhood: as a young six year old boy in 2002; during his preadolescence; his adolescence; and finally when he goes to college. The audience literally sees him grow up before our eyes. We also see Mason's relationships with his parents, including his divorced mother (played by Patricia Arquette), his father (played by Ethan Hawke), and his older sister, Samantha (played by Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei).Boyhood is a fantastic movie and opens perfectly with a shot of Mason looking up at the clouds in the sky (which is what is on the movie poster). The first shot is excellent because it helps to introduce us to Mason's character, and it is also a perfect representation of what a child does: question and wonder, and look up at the blue sky outside.As someone who grew up around the same time period as Mason's character, I can attest to this film being a perfect time capsule of that period. It reminded of the innocence, the trends and fads, such as watching Dragon Ball Z, playing Pokemon, reading Harry Potter, exploring the outdoors with friends, using laptops and computers, listening to popular music bands of the time, and everything else that happened to me as a child. Much like Mason's character, my mother moved us when I was younger, and I could relate to the pressures of losing friends and meeting new ones, as Mason did in the film when he moved to Texas.This film features pretty great performances from all the actors here, especially since it was shot over a twelve year period, and you can tell by how much older the actors look at the end of the picture. Ellar Coltrane, in, basically, his acting debut since the film started in 2002, is really good. Even as a child, he is totally believable. As an adolescent, he conveys great energy and the attitude of ""I don't care"". Patricia Arquette is a revelation to me in this film. To be honest, I've never been much of a fan of hers, but with her portrayal as Mason's mother (who doesn't have a first name and is just referred to as mom even in the credits) is absolutely terrific. She plays a stressed out woman who has to raise two kids on her own. During the house scene, at the beginning of the film, we see her arguing with her then husband which eventually leads to their divorce. She is really strong at conveying her annoyance and frustration, and most of her best scenes are when she is angry. She conveys a lot of emotion and it shows her range. Ethan Hawke is also very good as Mason's father. I particularly liked the scene where he is with his kids in the car and pretends to talk like their talking about their week when they're really not (he is disappointed because his kids never talk about what their week was like). Richard Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei, who plays Mason's older sister, Samantha, is very good, even cute at the beginning of the picture when she uses a fictional language that she created herself. She is also very good when she is being the very much stressed out, disobedient, teenage girl later on. On an interesting note, despite her character being older than Mason in the film, she is actually only three months older than Coltrane in real life.What I especially liked about Boyhood was the character arc and relationships. Mason's story is told over several episodes, and we do see his character change and grow: he goes from being a naïve young boy to a teenager who seems to be unsure of himself. The relationship between him and the various people in his life are interesting. His relationship with his father, for example, goes from being basically nonexistent and quiet, to the two actually bonding, especially when they go camping. Mason's relationship with his mother, however, is very sour throughout the film. Although this relationship could feel unsatisfied and unresolved, instead, it feels more like its only one small part of the bigger picture.Boyhood is a film that gave me a feeling of satisfaction. Richard Linklater has really captured the feeling of childhood innocence and the struggles of growing up. I cannot recommend it more than this: Boyhood is a masterpiece of filmmaking and one of the very best films of the year."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,10/10,"This film has touched me in a way no other film ever has before (or likely ever will again). It spoke to and connected with me on a fundamental level that I never knew cinema could reach. This truly is a masterpiece and anyone, anywhere can relate to this and smile, laugh and cry at it because it is so quintessentially relatable.This film explores the concept of life, something which is both incredibly difficult and risky to do; but don't worry, it does it expertly and makes you forget any doubts you may have had.It has made me look back on my own childhood and relive it both through my own eyes and through those of the people who love me the most. It forced me to ask myself: as I was growing up, what were my parents thinking to themselves as they saw me mature and transform into an adult? And it has given me a look into my future as well. I now know how beautiful, perfect and somewhat tragic it will be to have children and watch them grow from small, curious, imaginative children into thoughtful, mature and independent adults. Everything from the cast to the cinematography is stellar and unbeatable. Even the soundtrack is perfect!And let's not forget perhaps the most amazing thing about the entire film: it is filmed over the course of twelve years with the same actors. This means you literally get to watch these characters grow up on screen. It's incredulous yet also heartbreaking because it truly forces us to come to the realisation that life is not a timeless experience and it does indeed end for us all. Whether we like it or not, one day we will look back and inevitably ask ourselves: where on earth did the time go?Get out there and make the most of your life - because you'd better believe it's too short. That is what this film whispers to you as it touches your soul.I'm still thinking about this film. And I know I will be weeks, months, likely even years from now. It has so many life lessons and moments we all have in our lives that we will cherish forever and it manages to sculpt them all together into this gorgeous and immaculate work of art.Thank you Mr. Linklater and all of those who played a part in making this masterpiece come to life. I have struggled for years to select a film to christen my favourite of all time; however this struggle is now over. Boyhood is my favourite film of all time. It is beautiful, utterly thought-provoking, emotionally engaging, and different. Which is perhaps the most unbelievable part of it all; whilst emphasising to the viewer how similar we all are and how we all go through this very same process of growing up, this film manages to stand out.It is no wonder this film has won three Golden Globes and will undoubtedly win several Oscars as well. If there is any film in all of existence every person on the planet should make a point of viewing, it's this one."
BOYHOOD,4 August 2014,9/10,"Richard Linklater's masterful new movie BOYHOOD chronicles one family's journey through time - focusing primarily on Mason, a 5 year-old boy who we first see engulfed by the green of a meadow, gazing up at the clouds in a clear blue sky - dreamy and contemplative - peering at a ""hole"" in the firmament - indicative of a spirited intelligence and a demanding curiosity which becomes more apparent as we accompany him through the seasons of his life till he becomes 18 years old. What makes this movie so rare and acutely natural, is the director's use of identical actors - Linklater reunited the same cast a few days annually - over the span of 12 years to film a narrative based on fiction, though (according to interviews I read with the director) some parts are semi- autobiographical. We the audience are privy to the ease of the character's interactions, the resilience of relationships, the corporeal transformations, the disappointments, struggles, and joys as we pass through the unknown that is the span of their lives, echoing the stories of our own odysseys. Ellar Coltrane as Mason gives a performance that is not a performance but a revelation - an uncovering of a presence — the son of a divorced woman (a luminous Patricia Arquette) who is responsible for the care of her two children; a carefree, unaccountable, but loving father (Ethan Hawke in another terrific role) and the ever-present sibling (Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter, a feisty budding actor playing the sister) who is three years older and both annoyed and annoying to her little brother. The tribulations on the path from childhood, when we do not have much control over one's life to adulthood, when you do have the ability and capacity to make choices for yourself - are documented with an honesty which pays attention to details that are both intricate and commonplace.There is a lot of familial affection in BOYHOOD as each individual in the movie reconciles, adapts or rebels at changes in his/her situation. Adults make mistakes - the ever-watchful mother is equally observed by her vigilant son who is sensitive to nuances in the glances and expressions that pass between grownups, which only a child can sense intuitively, without fully grasping their intent and personal significance. Mason is a rangy, affable young man - good-natured, perceptive, and literally probing - investigating the world around him, be it by asking THE existential questions such as - how do we find and express that kernel of ourselves distinct from others - or in his teens examining the poetry of phenomena and wonder with a camera. BOYHOOD could have been titled FAMILY-HOOD; the dynamics of the nuclear family are played out from the drama of routine financial burdens to the thrilling awakenings and complexity of sexual attraction, love, friendship and loss. The continuous unfolding of the passage to maturity is breathtaking in its subtlety. Before our eyes we witness the entry to confidence and self-awareness using a cinematic technique that is unique; one scene smoothly flowing into the next communicating that time moves on relentlessly - and we are all caught up in the undulations of the tides. Link to Interview with director Richard Linklater:http://tinyurl.com/mx3z6g9e"
BOYHOOD,21 February 2015,,"Richard Linklater is a filmmaker who for decades has consistently produced a variety of intelligent and entertaining films without ever showing an ability to make anything on the level of ""Boyhood"", a film that encapsulates a boy's rite of passage from childhood through adolescence to the beginning of his maturity as a man. Ironically, its greatest achievement (and the reason Linklater could be the filmmaker to succeed at this where others would fail) is in its lack of any stylistic flourishes; it truly makes a virtue of non-showy cinema. In other words, here a rather mundane filmmaker perfectly centered managed to make a cinematic document of human life in the late 20th century worthy of a time capsule for the future that a great filmmaker like Kubrick, Scorsese or even Bergman couldn't have managed.Though less blatantly emotional than other favorites this year, what this film accomplishes truly makes it a landmark film. In May 2002, director Linklater roped a group of actors (including Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) and two young people (a 6-year old boy, Ellar Coltrane and a 7-year old girl, Linklater's daughter Lorelei) into a 12-year project (shooting only a few days each year) that would follow a family to document a Midwestern boy's rite of passage from childhood to his leaving home for college. This is the kind of ambitious undertaking ripe for going off the rails at any point during the 12 years of production, but it's a success on all levels. Linklater not only pulled it off, he avoided all pitfalls that could have turned it into a large, over-milked drama.Patricia Arquette is arguably the film's strong center, and it is the epitome of her career. Although ""Boyhood"" isn't really showy and the script provides the cast with no 'big' movie scenes, she fulfills everything the part requires, playing the boy's mother with such verisimilitude that you'd swear she really IS the boy's mother. At moments she's annoying, dismissive, loquacious, dominating, stolid, as well as nurturing and protective. In effect, a real mom, the way many growing up in this era remember a mother to be.Although maybe not blatantly cinematic as some of the visceral and monumental movies you usually are thrilled by, this is a really great human document you owe it to yourself to experience."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,6/10,"A 6/10 for this movie. I have to give it for presenting some situations related to life after a divorce.If you want my opinion - and who wouldn't :D - don't necessarily bring your kids to this film if you are a divorced parent. The reason is, the script presents some situations that are sad, and little probable to happen to you as a divorced parent. I had my kiddo with me, and I felt he might have got stressed that the new husband of his mom might be a bad guy and cause pain to his mom and family. This is the weakest part of this movie - not being always realistic and being somehow too depressing by pushing the real situations a bit too far.On the other side, as mentioned, too much 'all the kids will do drugs' in this movie. Your kids might have the impression that it is something usual. I'm not a anti-drugs activist, but I'm not comfortable with the idea that this movie supposedly presents typical situations, and these situations involve drug usage, be it simply smoking weed.Otherwise, perhaps there was no need to film with the same actors for many years, and sadly we can see no true chemistry between Ethan Hawke and the kids."
BOYHOOD,26 January 2018,2/10,"There is only one word that can describe this audiovisual project (I reject to call this collage of unrelated scenes a movie): Tedious. Absolutely nothing happens: Boring people living their boring life, growing boring kids that keep being boring and becoming boring adults. And it lasts 3 hours! The cinemathography is astounding for such a borefest, but no image, no photography, no makeup effect could keep this movie alive. There were a lot of scenes that could have saved this movie if somebody decided to exploit them, for example there was a moment where the guy that was living with the female protagonist was asked by her to relax the huge amount of rules he had. This could be a moment they could have had a conversation about the importance of rules vs freedom, a negociation of sorts about those rules, a dramatic moment with the male exploding in violence... It was full of potential. It could be anything. What this movie does? Nothing, it goes to the scene of the teenagers with his biological dad goint to the baseball park. And thats it. I give the extra point because following the same actors for 12 freaking years was incredible and the cinemathography was incredible. Still it should be completely avoided, unless other people's boring life is enough to you."
BOYHOOD,26 December 2014,9/10,"Sometimes when we watch a movie or see selected scenes in movies we can't help but relate them into our own reality, whether it be the good the bad or the ugly there are always some moments. These moments in film don't have to be the stand out scenes either they can be that little piece needed so the director could tie in an earlier scene or bit of dialogue. I know for myself these moments are what I love about film, I love when I can relate and replace myself with the actor or vice versa, replace the actor with myself in this reality. Mason Jr Evans Played by Ellar Coltrane (no film history) is a six year old in 2002 he over hears his mother Olivia played by Patricia Arquette (Medium) saying she needs more space and wants to complete her study and find a professional career. Next scene Mason, Olivia and his sister Samantha played by Lorelei Linklater (daughter of the director and her first role also) are travelling to a new town in the car. The next few scenes Mason Jr and Samantha's father Mason Snr played by Ethan Hawke (Gattaca, Daybreakers) shows up and takes the kids bowling, apologising for being away for the last 18 months in Alaska. Both Mason Jr and Samantha have dreams their parents will get back together but once Olivia gets home and finds Mason Snr in her home an argument ensues and he quickly leaves without saying goodbye to the two kids, who have watched their parent disagreement from an upstairs window. 12 years pass over the next 2 hrs and 45 minutes, in that time we get to see the kids grow, we hurt when they hurt, we love when they love and best of all it is always the same people. There is so much I can write here but I won't not in fear of giving anything away more in the hope your expectations remain level headed. Boyhood is more than a film, it's an experiment done right, it's a story told so well you'd be forgiven in thinking there was no script that it was all reality, that the director Richard Linklater just started following around this family, sure the family has some very familiar faces and names but still that should just tell you how good the acting and characters actually are. How good the acting, storytelling, music and cinematography actually is. Told over 12 years Boyhood is in a league of its own, a ground breaking masterpiece. Using all the same actors over 12 years it is nothing less than a masterpiece. Linklater also directed one of my all-time favourite comedies; School of rock and is now ready to direct the TV series of the same name (which I personally cannot wait to see) The idea itself has blown me away and I for one take my hat off to this genius. Boyhood is a very long film and in places was a little boring, sometimes thought if they just added a few more scenes to this specific timeline it would make all the difference, but then this is a film based on life and sometimes life doesn't have that climax we get from films. It's a film you can slot yourself into, exactly the way you should be able. Enjoy this for the ride it takes you on and the amazing little actors it has brought into the world of cinema. I totally recommend this film for everyone, don't expect anything other than life though because if you want more you may be better off turning on and watching Die Hard for the 15th time."
BOYHOOD,9 March 2015,9/10,"'Boyhood' is Richard Linklater's extraordinary new film, filmed over 12 years from 2002 to 2014 with the same cast throughout. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are Olivia and Mason, parents of Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) and Mason Jnr. (Ellar Coltrane).We watch this family grow together, especially Mason Jnr. who starts at the periphery but eventually anchors this film. Their lives are as normal as ours, Olivia and Mason eventually split and wrestle with their lives apart but still remain together as parents. They have new partners, new commitments, new homes, new careers, new decisions to make and problems to resolve.Its the children, especially Mason Jnr. who capture our imagination. All the familiar rites of passage are seen from him, but presented with minimal histrionics. Considering his uneven family structure, Mason accepts his various circumstances with diplomacy and humility. The drama is simply himself, from age 5 to 18. His life is shown with so much intimacy you would think its a documentary. His life is a casual procession of moments of time which come and go without hesitation.We're committed, and perhaps conditioned, to watching Mason Jnr. grow and develop as a person. You could be a grandparent or parent or a sibling, whoever you are you can't help but relate to him. All the way through, whatever you see thrown at Mason Jnr, you just know you'll simply say ""He turned out fine, I don't know why i worried"".Linklater shoots everything with a casual open-handedness, on a film which must have been a logistical nightmare, not least with being fortunate enough to retain the same cast over such a long time. As well as ensuring some continuity to the film, his own experiences as a director will have changed. Its a staggering feat, and a huge gamble that in a long and fruitful career may well prove to be his best film.'Boyhood' is one of the defining films about a child's passage into adulthood, and as a study of family life is similarly outstanding. The film asks a lot of questions, not only about a child's perspective and parenting but also social conditioning. By the end of the film, that familiar question ""Where did the time go?"" appears. 'Boyhood' is a celebration of time in all its simplicity, of those millions of fleeting moments which encompasses our existences. Its we as humans who make time complicated."
BOYHOOD,4 April 2021,8/10,"""Boyhood"" is a simple story of the childhood of protagonist Mason, but the story is told without a sense of fabrication-instead of a story, it's more like a journal of an actual person. This journal's about development, introspection, and family. Following Mason's POV, we see his mother, troubled by her career and problems with her husbands; we see his father, carefree yet faithful, who always supports his children with love. As Mason himself slowly embraces maturity and finds his meaning in life as a freshman. There's not much movie that are willing to shoot for 12 years, the ones that do-Boyhood-is the essence of the director's inspiration, and the perfect interpretation of one character."
BOYHOOD,14 September 2014,7/10,"Another gem from director Richard Linklater. You might even call it his masterpiece, I know I'm debating this as I write even now. The premise is: a boy grows physically, intellectually, and spiritually over the years. It is famous for being a movie twelve years in the making, visiting the actors, settings, and even some props every year or two, to not just tell a story, but to literally show it. As I watched the first two or three jumps-in-time, I was very conscious of the rare technique, thinking all sorts of things like about the logistics of such an endeavor, how the actors had to really commit in a way that most actors don't have to, how the director committed and achieved his vision, what that preliminary vision even was, how complete he thought it all out or not, how improvised it was or was not, how much the direction changed over the years. And then, as the years kept jumping, I felt the characters begin to appear. I began to find myself searching inside little Mason and feeling his strengths and fears, his quirks, and mannerisms. I began to find myself watching the other people in his life and watching them age, change, and mature. Melancholy arose, humor arose, neat coincidences arose, goodbyes whisked by. There were surprises like people showing themselves as less wholesome than they first appeared, or people stepping up to the plate after seeming like perpetual losers, somethings seemed vague and never fully connected. But in the end, it felt just like life. It even shows us ourselves in our cute phases through the pop songs that pepper the soundtrack, through the politics of the day, as well as through the the growing prominence of technological gadgetry. But in the end, it's just the rare moments that make the magic, snippets of the boy and his sister as kids fighting, snippets of them hanging with their dad on the weekends, snippets of their mom in the background always trying her best, never asking for repayment, snippets of the pressure to get along with other kids, and snippets of trying to make a place in the world. The photography is poetically beautiful at times, and the editing is unbeatable. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are astoundingly good, and so is the lead actor, Ellar Coltrane. It's almost impossible to rate or rank it on the same night of having first watched it. It feels like it will take some time to process it and understand what we've really been given. I think that this is its greatest gift, this feeling of having nothing else to compare it with, just like our own lives. All we can say is that it is potent, fragile, and the moment is always new."
BOYHOOD,15 April 2018,8/10,"I have to balance out the difference between the magnificence of the achievement, and its overall flow as a film, and in doing this, I find myself conflicted in ways I haven't been before, when reviewing a film. BOYHOOD is a fantastic work, with regards to what it is you are watching when you view the film. A time capsule in motion, centered around Ellar Coltrane, the boy in question, playing Mason, the titular character. Watching him grow from a boy to a young man is the meat of this movie, and it delivers, once you step back and really take in what it is you are absorbing. But the conflict, for me, is in the flow of the film. There are scenes that I find to be unnecessary, at least with respect to plot. There are scenes that are in the film purely for the sake of the overall experiment, instead of the narrative, and although I don't find them too distracting, it does linger in my mind when a scene is presented that has no overall impact on the film itself. Characters are introduced and discarded as quickly as they come in, representing a mere fragment in Mason's life. Don't get me wrong--there is value in what you see, but its impact on the overall film is lacking, and sometimes distracting when it leads nowhere.Thank goodness this is not the case for the overall film's quality, in which there were many moments of sweeping excellence to make up for its minor flaws. I have to give the film an 8, against the swarm of critics who gave it full marks, because I think the experiment got in the way of the narrative. That being said, BOYHOOD is CERTAINLY is a film I would recommend that everyone see, if for no other reason than to witness the spectacle of so many excellent actors and creators moving through time in real-time, with the reflections of America's ever-changing landscape in the background of every scene. Nobody delivers a poor performance here, from Linklater's daughter playing Mason's sister, to Ethan Hawke playing their father. The music was well done, save for some of the lyrics of songs written by Ethan Hawke for the film, since he plays an overly ambitious but ultimately unfulfilled musician, which I hope was the point of his relatively average music. Touching in its placement and purpose, but lacking in the kind of delivery normally associated with films and their powerful moments.I struggled for a long time trying to rate this film, and wish I could give it at least a 9, for the impressive achievement that it is, in that something like this has never been attempted before. But as it happens with new ground, you don't always shine absolutely brilliant when you first blaze the trail. It's filled with dangers, misfortunes, and mistakes, and ultimately learning about what to do and what not to do in the future. It will be interesting to see what the impact of such a film will have on the world of film, as time goes on."
BOYHOOD,3 March 2019,10/10,"I just had some fuss with my family which made me sad, 'cause I'm currently far away from them in a kind of college, and I miss them, and then I stumbled upon this movie. As another reviewer said, ""this is life!"" It really is. It is so completely real, that at one point towards the ending I came to a quick realization that it's actually fiction, and I'm not just going down my neighbour's or my old friend's or a stranger's memory lane. But it could've been. And parts of it you identify with so much that it feels like *you* are legitimately re-living your *own* childhood/boyhood. That's what I call a masterpiece of cinema.
It did exactly what it wanted to do as I see it; lets life move around you and lets you feel time while asking all kinds of deep-felt questions, which we the audience are left to dwell on.
Thank you for this special experience. Made me feel a whole lot clearer about everything."
BOYHOOD,27 July 2018,10/10,"Boyhood gets alot of praise, which in turn can heighten your expectations, and maybe it wont seem so great. I was wrong about that. This is a classic. Plot- Its genius and as simplistic as can be. It's life. You will quite literally watch a little boy grow up and face those trivial, life changing moments (each year of his life being 15 minutes run time) I related to alot of content in the film, so maybe I'm a bit biased here, but it just seemed so potent watching everything change, seeing every actor get older. Writing- Beautiful. Naturally written, with no forced moments. Never tries too hard to be profound, it always exemplifies those points subtly. Its not entirely quotable, yet the moments had are very memorable and sweet. Acting/Characters- These actors had to maintain an obligation to this film for 12 years, and they stay in character through it all. You can tell it was a very personal experience, for the actors are so natural in their roles (perhaps discredit Richard Linklaters daughter slightly) and every moment feel genuine, no cardboard melodrama at all. Quality-They took 12 years of change, and still made an important film out of it accordingly. The music is great, the scenery and straight forward cinematography was necessary to make it feel lifelike. It's a film that does what no other has done. Overall, Boyhood is fantastic, unless you cannot handle movies that are realistic and sentimental. It made me tear up, and as it went along I quite literally said ""they grew up so fast"" by the end of it. The ending alone was enough to make me sit there and contemplate hard. I think everyone and anyone should watch it. We all grew up, didn't we?"
BOYHOOD,27 August 2020,6/10,"Such an unusual concept, to use the same actors over several years and portray them changing. I enjoyed it on that basis but - if I'm honest - I found the film far too long and, in parts, I fast-forwarded it just to get through the 3 hours. As an exercise in innovative film-making it is to be commended but it couldn't hold my attention and interest as well as I'd hoped."
BOYHOOD,26 June 2018,2/10,"If you are considering watching this movie, you must expect that you will watch a boy's life through 12 years as the description of movie say BUT what makes this movie interesting or special?... it is the 12 years in making!!!.. This movie was made to present an ordinary boy's life, his thoughts and prospective on living that came from his observations and interactions. I like this movie and would recommend it to everyone who would like to watch a special movie with an ordinary (if not without) plot OR at least like to watch sweet movie on ""regular"" life."
BOYHOOD,6 February 2021,6/10,"The film is without a doubt an impressive and innovative project and deserves respect for that. But as innovative as the idea is, the actual story remains generic. The film is incredibly realistic, but at its core it remains an arbitrary, interchangeable story of a childhood, made up of the same elements as seen in so many films."
BOYHOOD,29 May 2015,5/10,"Boyhood is a meandering film with utterly terrible acting. In fact, it (the acting) was so bad I felt like I was watching a low-grade adult film half the time. The ironic part was that when the main characters were young they felt more believable. After awhile, I found myself asking: ""What am I watching? What is this?"" The gimmick alone gives this movie a 5, but actual plot, casting and pace are horrible, cliché and downright boring. I was disappointed with a film that paid so much attention to things like using the same actors over a 12-year span would completely ignore casting. The two central characters look NOTHING alike. They honestly try to make you believe they are biological siblings despite having completely different skin-tones, hair color and basic physical features. You will look at them and say: What? These two had a blonde-haired, blue- eyed mom and an Ethan Hawke dad? The main character mumbles for half the movie and is actually quite depressing. How he scores a gorgeous girlfriend for a couple segments is beyond me...Watch once, but that's all you'll need."
BOYHOOD,20 July 2014,10/10,"Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" is becoming famous for being shot over 12 years using the same actors. It's a brave and unique feat where everything could have gone wrong. Actors could have died or refused to continue with the project. The lead actor Ellar Coltrane could have given up or many other problems could have risen. However, everything went right for this film.""Boyhood"" is the story of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his family (Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Lorelei Linklater) as Mason grows up from age 5 to 18. It's a pretty simple story, but so much happens and we see how all the little things shape Mason as he grow up. It's quite powerful and poetic.Ellar Coltrane is great as Mason. He feels very natural and makes us feel everything he goes through, whether its romance or terror. Mason is the center and heart of the film and he carries it beautifully. Arquette and Hawke are fantastic as Mason's parents. Arquette is the stable, working single mother with a list of bad boyfriends and Hawke is the fun and spontaneous father who only sees the kids every couple of weeks. Lorelei Linklater is a hoot as Mason's sister. She steals the scenes with her humor.""Boyhood"" is like a photo album. Instead of focusing on some of the major things of childhood, we get to see the smaller moments. The ones that can mean much more to us, whether it's moving to a new house and school, a camping trip with a parent, or a discussion with a teacher. Richard Linklater captures the essence of childhood and shows it all. There are plenty of coming of age films, but this one truly gets at the heart of childhood and the transition to adulthood. For me, this film captures my generation's childhood. We see some of the cultural aspects, like the Harry Potter craze and the progression of music from Coldplay and Blink-182 to Gotye and The Black Keys. We see the war in Iraq unfold and the Obama Biden campaign. We see the fashion trends and the video games that have been popular. It made me look back on my childhood and all these moments. I could relate to every chapter of this film. Anyone who has gone through childhood can find something to relate to in this film.I'm also a fan of Richard Linklater's films. ""Boyhood"" has almost everything you want in a Linklater film, whether it's a long tracking shot, philosophical discussions about time and living in the moment, witty humor, and an emotional punch. Linklater's ""Boyhood"" is a great film. It may be a little slow for some, but I found myself engaged throughout the whole film. It's a film that probably deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate it. There's a lot to take it in. This film takes you back to childhood and captures what it's like to grow up, for better or for worse. Linklater is a great filmmaker and I hope this film helps more people to appreciate him and his work."
BOYHOOD,20 February 2014,10/10,"On the surface, Boyhood is just a coming of age film, not the first in Richard Linklater's career. Beneath the surface it is one of the most unusual projects in film history and easily Linklater's opus magnum. It depicts the growing up of Mason (Ellar Coltrane), a dreamy, imaginative, sensitive boy, son of a single mother without much luck when it comes to men and an easygoing though slightly irresponsible father. The unusual thing: Linklater filmed this over the span of eleven years, assembling the same cast every year. What we see is a boy of seven growing into a young man just starting college. The light narrative touch Linklater is such a master of is all there as he weaves the scenes together effortlessly into a long narrative in which time moves on naturally. Mason grows older without breaks, moves from childhood through adolescence to young adulthood. The adults, too, developed, move on, grow older, regress occasionally. The film consists of scenes depicting ordinary lives, the camera is unobtrusive, at times almost documentary- like, the music well-chosen and supportive, the narrative rhythm organic. There is some drama, charming banality, the film isn't free of clichés and stereotypes, yet it breathes life in what is a stream of living, trying to find a way, drifting along, seeking direction. In a way, everyone tries to grow up, father, mother, children. this could have been just an impressive project. As it stands, it is a true masterpiece, an entirely compelling and – though completely unsentimental – deeply moving film.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"
BOYHOOD,3 September 2014,8/10,"Boyhood is shot in 12 years, every year two weeks, with the same cast. That is the first time anyone did something like this and therefor this movie got a lot of attention. People say it's an instant classic. The acting is good, especially Patricia Arquette will be remembered for her part of Mom. The way she struggles as a young mom ('I was somebody's daughter, then I was somebody's mother!') and matures throughout the movie is memorable to say the least. Although the main character of the movie is her son Mason (Ellar Coltrane, who was 6 when the first scene was shot and 18 when the last scene was shot) the story of the mother is as interesting as his, if not even more. With so many years of filming, the way the scenes flow into each other without noticing a year has passed is also wonderfully done. It was a joy to watch this movie, the dialogues are strong, the acting good and the montage was sublime.But everything that was remotely starting to add some drama to the easily flowing story, was immediately solved when the next scene took place a year later. I tried to wrap my head around what was wrong with this movie, why I didn't have the orgasmic enthusiasm I read on the internet reviews and that is the thing: it is almost boring. Almost, because the story that is being told is still interesting although not much happens. You walk along with this boy from 6 to 18 when the movie ends. What happens next? I don't really care. It's a nice experience but will I remember the story next year? I doubt that. But once again, I think Patricia Arquette is the star here. If not for her, my rating would be lower."
BOYHOOD,9 March 2015,2/10,"This movie is slow and has no conclusion. Except that it has the message: you have only this moment and time goes fast.So while the movie is long, the gimmick is that 12 years can feel like only a few hours. A sobering thought which I think is the only point to the movie.Therefore instead of reading this review further or watching the movie, rather spend your time living.There are a lot of mistakes in the movie and it has no real point, but strangely I still liked it. Probably because I 'get it'.It solely focuses on the perspective of the lead character, Mason. Therefore when Mason and his family move state or city, the viewer doesn't get the chance to see what happened to the other people in his life. You have to move on like he does. Some scenes just don't make sense to me at all. For example, in one scene Mason is bullied. There is no reason to it, it happens once and that's it. So although there is no story in the bullying the director decided to show it. Similarly Mason has this friend at graduation. This is not a friend shown to us before or after graduation again. I have no idea why he was there at all. Now you see them. Now you don't. Very strange and pointless and happens several times in the movie.Mom and dad's acting are great. The actors playing Mason and Sam are not bad either. But it is a movie with gaps and a slow pace so not every one's cup of tea.I gave it an 8 as I like the relationship between Mason and his Mom and Dad. I also liked that this wasn't like something else I've seen before, it was new and interesting and had its own brand of entertaining."
BOYHOOD,24 September 2014,1/10,"So the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years. Wow, yeah, crazy. You know what else happened over a period of 12 years? Lots of nothing to lots of other people, just like in this movie, in which nothing freaking happens.12 years and this is what they came up with? For crying out loud. This movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an Arkansas corn field for 12 years. Maybe my life's so much more interesting than everyone else's who gave this movie rave reviews. Are people so boring that it's now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? And the guy is gay! Didn't anyone else notice that? I've nothing against gay people but we're supposed to believe he's straight. Come on. If that'd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there: look, he's finally coming out of the closet. Shocker! And what did these people have against hair brushes? Maybe it's too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening, a hint of not so awfully-boring-why-God-did-I-agree-to-watch-this-?! I want a refund."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2016,10/10,"Along with being the single most conceptually complex movie ever made, it's possibly the most interesting and uninteresting movie that I've ever reviewed. I'll unpack that box in a minute but first let me give you the rundown of what it's about. The movie follows a young boy named Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, as he literally grows from a boy to a man and chronicles all the loves, losses, joys and disappointments of growing up in Texas along with his mother, father and sister played by Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and the director's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater.The film is the brainchild of director Richard Linklater and literally took 12 years to make as it weaves through the early 2000s until present day. From a conceptual standpoint alone I should be giving this movie 10 stars. The style is consistent across the years, well shot and the actors grow up and grow old before your very eyes... that is except for Ethan Hawke who is apparently some sort of immortal daywalker vampire. Needless to say, this is a true achievement in film from a technical standpoint. From a story standpoint, it's a little different. The story in the film has this feeling like it was written on the fly, without any real direction as to where it was going or what it was building towards any kind of earth shattering event but here's the thing, there comes a point where the movie knows you're realizing that fact and it even addresses it but asks you to hold on just a little longer. By the end of the show, the message the film has plays a lot like real life, not every story is glamorous and dramatic, real life is what it is and a lot of times it's not super eventful but when you look back over everything, you truly saw a boy grow into a man and experience the kind of joy, disappointment, loss, and love that we all do and it was done in a real life kind of way.Overall, I really liked this movie and despite the fact that a lot of the acting by the kids was less than stellar, and the plot seemed to meander a bit over it's nearly 3 hour run time, the end product was such an achievement that I really can't knock off any points for any mistakes in pacing because at the end of the day, I got where I needed to be and honestly It just couldn't have been done better! Plus, the movie was shot in Houston, Austin and San Marcos, three cities I call home. Taking all into consideration, I simply CAN'T give this movie any less than a perfect 5...out of 5."
BOYHOOD,10 September 2014,6/10,"Some people watch films as a medium to something(entertainment, art, feelings of empathy, etc), others watch them to watch themselves doing so in order to later pat themselves on the back for being ""deep people"", people who like this are probably in the latter category.It seems people don't understand what films are about, once you are in the movie theatre the only thing that matters is the experience, it does not matter what you heard about how inspirational the director is or how prolonged the production of a film is or other crap like that. Only the experience derived from the film matters! The fact is that this is a boring movie, nothing happens, there is barely a protagonist, there is no purpose to it, you might say ""what about Persona?"" and I would say well if you are an elite director you can deviate from common film structure because you have the capacity to make us think, this director is not elite and the only thinking I did was wondering what I would be having for dinner.The relate-ability of characters is only a means to an end. That is, the director is supposed to make them likable so that we cheer for them in whatever they are trying to achieve. So having no goal kind of makes the characters pointless. Maybe they are supposed to make us self-reflect? By the time this guy turns into a teenager and opens his mouth I think its tough to relate to him anymore so any potential for self-reflection was long out of the window by the time I walked out."
BOYHOOD,7 July 2014,10/10,"3 hours and not a boring second. Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood"" transfers an idea that could have a been a disaster into something groundbreaking, heartwarming and very true.The story around Mason (Ellar Coltrane) as we follow him from age 7 to the beginning of his college life is a fine tuned and superbly executed movie, that has gained its momentum whilst being shot over 12 years.The earmarks that make up the coming-of-age of a human being are often so small they are passed over by the enormity of historical events. Yet for Linklater it's exactly those moments which pass so quickly that make up a life. And which he is able to capture like nobody else before him.The authenticity that a twelve year shooting schedule brings is mined to its very core, and it will be hard for anybody watching not to be reminded of those moments when everything tilts and you actually grow up.The acting is simple and very effective, the camera never lingers but respects its characters by observing them from a certain distance, and with every passing year we move closer to the ever liberating understanding, that life is one hell of a ride, although we have no way of knowing where it goes."
BOYHOOD,15 September 2015,10/10,"I watched this movie, because it was on Showtime, and my wife thought it sounded good, and it had 3 1/2 out of 4 stars rating on Showtime. I knew nothing about it other than it was long, and I recognized Patricia Arquette from Medium on TV and Ethan Hawke from elsewhere. I did not know it was filmed a few days at a time over 12 years with the same cast, a fairly remarkable feat. So here is my reaction to it without any background.As a movie, it hit on so many aspects of my own life that it seemed real. My experiences as a child were there. My experiences as an adult and absentee parent were there. Patricia Arquette portrayed what I imagined my ex-wife might have gone through, as well as what I think my own mother did go through. Her performance was so believable that I really felt bad for her. Great acting. Great direction.Ethan Hawke as the father. I was not one of those, but I have known a few of those weenie loser guys, and I think he nailed that character type. So much so, that it was such a relief when he finally straightened himself out. Makes you wonder if either he or the director may have been one of those guys at one time! Ellar Coltrane. Starting the role at age 7 and managing to be the same character for a few days once a year during the ages spanned by the movie? Wow. A tribute to what must be natural acting ability and a very good director.Lorelei Linklater. Director's daughter. Could there be a tougher job? Never good enough. Others whispering that she only got the job because of her father. 2nd tier supporting role. Etc. I thought she was good and believable, even though she doesn't look at all like her movie mother, father, or brother.The most amazing part of this story though is the studio that produced this. What a leap of faith to put all the time and resources--and $4 million--into a production that would not yield a penny for over 12 years! What could go wrong? No contracts with the actors. No guarantee that Ellar wouldn't turn ugly or untalented or addicted to drugs as he grew up. 12 years of shooting on 35mm film with potentially very different film lots and while the industry was moving to digital (which they couldn't have known at the beginning.) Can you even get insurance for a project taking this long? Kudos to the studio for taking a chance.I've seen it now on HD cable. I hope the Bluray disk has lots of extras on background and the making of. I bet they'll be studying this movie in film schools for a long time. Producers, directors, back office...everyone will want to know how they did it."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,6/10,"Can you see the poster? At the top it says ""A moving 12 year epic that isn't quite like anything in the history of cinema."" THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CINEMA. And it's so moving I can't stand it.How can this be a classic. I mean everyone has a boyhood. What's so f***ing special about Mason's? 100% metascore! Can't believe even the critics fell for Linktlater's con. Honestly do you think it's a ""perfect"" movie? I hope it wins a Oscar or two and get some recognition so that more people gets to rate this films and it gets out of top250.The film looks so unreal! It never gave me the impression that it's something more than a documentary. Any idiot with a camera and a lot's of patient can make a film like boyhood. If you have kids you probably film their lives, don't you? What I'm saying is that a lot of people doing the same thing. But it takes something more to make a cinema.The acting is stupid. I don't know what to expect from bunch of kids who learned acting through this movie. Although I liked Ehtan Hawk and Patricia Arquette's performance. But nothing Oscar worthy. These two are the best thing in this film. Not that there are many good stuffs in it. Unreality. They shot the film in the span of 12 years. Still shots from last decade looks unreal. It's like they are trying to prove that they worked very hard or something.Does Boyhood makes you nostalgic? For me that's the ultimate cheap shot taken by Richard Linklater.Final Verdict: I want my 3 hours back. It's a stupid film, filmed moronically to trick you into believing something that's not real."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2020,1/10,"I can easily watch my nieces or neighbours growing up, what's the point of watching some people growing old? The only thing in that movie is shooting during 12 years, I feel sorry for that waste, it could have some plot or any action, no one took that risk before but it was not necessary!!! And I hate Maeson's hair, oh and I watched half of the movie then I skipped the scenes and I deleted it after I saw nothing changed, I wish if there rating under zero value to rate that movie"
BOYHOOD,29 August 2014,10/10,I don't know of many movies I've given a 10 to (other than The Godfather which I saw in theaters as a boy). This movie is simply brilliant. Incredibly realistic. Has to be a major favorite to win Best Picture. One of the most unique films ever made. Ethan Hawke is the most real person in any movie I've seen. Really all the actors reflect that reality (though Hawke is exceptional). See this movie. It was a joy to watch. It will be a joy. My only disappointment is that I want it to go on and on and never end. Maybe Linkater and the rest of the crew will continue the story? That would be fantastic.
BOYHOOD,1 March 2015,8/10,"Boyhood is literally 12 years packed in about 2.5hrs.It gets boring for some people but for me it is fascinating to see a kid literally grow up in front of my eyes.Dialogue is so well written that everything flows naturally and in place and at the same time tells you everything you need to know about whats happening in the boy's life. The lost childhood friends, the half siblings, the bullies, the teachers, the girlfriends.. the embarrassment of a bad haircut, the quaint time spent with father, the glimpse of a step father's questionable habit, the rejection of a mother's kiss at school..Over the course of two hours we are shown what mattered and was memorable in the boy's (in fact any person's) life. Mom's speech about life as ""a series of milestones"" was almost right on point. This is what the movie was about, almost. It was not about milestones exactly but of what we remember of our childhood - a series of moments and memorable events that eventually shape us into who we are today.Those who got bored said it was boring (although they also said it was interesting) found it rather hard to keep focus because there were no up and downs, no build up or climaxes. But isn't that what life is? A series of events, some had tiny climaxes, then it goes on. There's no ""the end"" after a success/ failure, life goes on.Think about your own boyhood/ girlhood, what do you see? A series of moments disjointed and yet linked up because you were there, leading to where you are now? That's what this movie is, the Boyhood of a kid named Mason Jr."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,,"Boy Hood is a banal story, and its merit consists precisely in this point, in having followed closely the lives of ordinary people. Because this initiative invites the spectator to travel through his own memories and to visit important experiences of his life. Yet, among those banal moves, many very interesting issues arise, like (1) when Dad interacts with Mason and Samantha, (2) when Dad interacts with Mom, (3) the fact that Dad is cherished from the beginning to the end in spite of having been incapable of staying married to Mom.Watching this film came to my mind some important settings of my life in family. As I am of the generation of the grandparents Mason, I reminded the youth stages of my children and my interaction with them. I also reminded of episodes of my family life and why I struggled to keep married with the same woman instead of divorcing.The idea of making a film over 12 years with the same actors is a brilliant idea. The result is a story which seems much convincing. All the actors did a great job, specially Ellar Coltrane, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette.The tribulations of Mom with her sequence of failed marriages is a reason for Americans to meditate on what ever happened to the American family.The film is long yet it succeeds to catch the attention of the spectator from the beginning to the end. It deserves to be seen, for sure."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2018,10/10,Wonderous story of a boy journeying through life. I don't like any of Linklaters films. Not one. But this is spellbinding. So he finally gets one on the board!This film is not for anyone who needs pops and bangs in their movies. It's also not for 99% of Brainless North AmericansDefinitely one of the best films of the 21sr century.
BOYHOOD,11 March 2015,3/10,"Now, this film isn't really about anything. The film doesn't have a story, it is rather just a ""Documentary style"" type of Mockumentary.I don't like the film, because it is labeled as something super special and extraordinary, but why? The acting was bad,some were not even actors, and could hardly play them self. The story is some what unrealistic in terms of the way they tried to portray it, The all Drunk males and children going against their own batted single mother. The Children growing up in the condition that the film depicts, stay closer and show more respect for their single parent. The rest of the film feels like just random moments from a person memory bank. And the reason why this ""Documentary"" works so well as a film is because our society has this new fashion of wanting to know how other people live their life's."
BOYHOOD,3 December 2014,9/10,"Richard Linklater takes us on another trip to adolescence. The boyhood of main character Mason is followed from age 5 to 18. The trip includes key events in his life; like moving, school, girlfriends and family issues. All this is done in a typical Linklater style: long continuous shots with lots of dialogue.The gimmick in this critically acclaimed feature is to adapt the production and release of the feature to the real-time aging of the cast. This gives the coming of age genre a new and unique dimension. Although Linklater has done something alike in his 'Before' trilogy, where the various stages of a relationship are followed through time.During and after viewing I kept wondering though if it would have been better or worse when CGI was involved to depict the aging, or when multiple actors had portrayed the Mason character. I've come to the conclusion that is doesn't really matter that much, this is a work of fiction, not a documentary. Much of the current praise on this film is focused on the gimmick that is used. When you leave this out of the equation, what is left is still a pretty darn good picture and probably one of Linklater's finest. The fact that the director, crew and cast have invested a lot of time and effort during more than a decade to add to the realistic value is praiseworthy but no more than icing on the cake in my opinion."
BOYHOOD,1 November 2015,6/10,"This movie is one of those ''not bad but not great'' type of films. The story overall is quite original, the acting is good overall, the dialog is good as well, but this movie doesn't quite give you the feeling of ''what a great film !'', on the other hand it's not bad. It's the kind of movie you can sort of appreciate. and watch and not feel in he middle o the movie like ''what am I doing with my life ?'' Also, I get why people will hate this film. It got a lot of hype, the movie overall like I said isn't brilliant or fantastic, and some will consider this movie as a ''3 wasted hours'', which I can also understand. In my perspective, it's a good movie that you can watch with your friends and have a good time if you're bored for 3 hours."
BOYHOOD,13 March 2021,9/10,"A movie that sets from a boy to until he's off to college, and they used the same actors/actresses over the 12 years, such a beautiful movie, I highly recommend if you love film"
BOYHOOD,12 March 2021,9/10,"So i wanted to write about Boyhood for so many reason's.
I just finally watched it and i can say that i loved it very much.This post contains some nods towards the movie.I think that now was just perfect time to watch this movie for me.
I'm now 19 years old and i was born at 2001.
So i'm some years younger than main character Mason would be nowdays.
But i'm now around same age that Mason was af ending of movie.
I still feel that i growed up pretty similar times that Mason did in movie.
I found so many things where i can relate with him.
My mom read Harry Potter to me when i was child. I did dress up to Harry Potter for some parties.
We discussed about Star Wars with my friends when i was child. We totally had those discussions who is cooler Grievous or Yoda.
I had many hobbies when i was younger. I even collected rocks.
My parents divorced when i was young so i related with children's in this movie so much.
Dad figure was kinda similar to me. More like friend than dad.
I can see diffrent peoples around me in so many characters in this movie.
Of course there is many cultural differences because i lived my childhood in Finland and not USA but i can still see so much same.
Was so nice to see technological advancements that i also lived through.
This movie just brought so many memories to me from my childhood. Some good and some bad ones.
I also thinked lot about my future when i was watching.Just so good movie.
Yes i have seen movies that were probably more entertaining but i just loved how this movie was made.
I cried many times but mostly for happibes.
9/10 movie for me.
I think that some older peoples don't probably appreciate it as much as i did because they lived their childhood in different time.If you are still reading this very long post i appreciate a lot.
Thank you!"
BOYHOOD,21 February 2015,2/10,"What to say. Waiting for the film to start.. another hour.. still nothing much is happening part from they are getting older .. a new hair cut another haircut.. oh look another year a new haircut. It's no story no depth no.. nothing. Just years passing by. Thought it was getting a bit interesting for like 2 minutes then it was gone. Really how did this film end up with an 8 ? it's not even close to good. Yes good acting i guess... but good acting doesn't make a good film. Itäs really... not... happening anything much. 10 lines and no junk.. How much can one say about this film, I don't think it even deserves 10 lines. But OK. It's interesting .. or usual to see someone grow up in a film. But not interesting enough sadly. More just sad how see times goes by quite fast."
BOYHOOD,5 August 2014,,"To me, describing a film that way is kinda odd, but that *is* what ""Boyhood"" is. Filmed from 2002 to 2013, it tells the story of Mason from childhood to adulthood. He's played by the same actor, Ellar Coltrane. Other characters are, indeed, played by the same people. I don't think I've seen a film quite like this. In fact, I'm not really sure why it was filmed over such a long time, other than maybe to help make it seem real and... maybe be different. I dunno, but ""Boyhood"" is definitely entertaining and is a benchmark for filmmaking.Mason lives in Texas with his mother and his sister Samantha. Mason and Samantha's father lives separately and he occasionally spends time with them in the film, such as taking them bowling and taking Mason on a camping trip. The father is played excellently by Ethan Hawke, who's in several other films of writer/director Richard Linklater. Mason moves from place to place with his sister and mother, including the home of a particular man named Bill Welbrock, who marries Mason's mother. Bill's strict, abusive, and an alcoholic. Though he's not complex, I think he's one of the film's best supporting characters. ""Boyhood"" is a lengthy film with a lot of story, characters, and dialogue. When I think back on the film, Bill's someone who stands out. I guess it's because of the type of character that he is, as well as the terrific acting. In one of the film's best scenes, Bill becomes physically abusive during dinner, which shocked me. After that, Mason, Samantha, and their mother move out. I was wondering if Bill would show up again, but he doesn't.""Boyhood"" does succeed at being realistic. I honestly can't think of a phony scene or a phony character. The film is kinda like a documentary of someone's life. Mason's a pretty likable character, except maybe for a brief scene at the beginning where him and another kid are spraying graffiti on a wall somewhere. It annoys me a little. However, there are things that we've done in life, whether they're big or small, that we regret, so I shouldn't be too annoyed over it. Anyway, Ellar Coltrane's performance is very strong. In fact, all of the actors and actresses give solid performances. Assuming that there's little to no improvisation, the writing is also really good.I mentioned that ""Boyhood"" is lengthy. It is roughly 2 hours and 45 minutes, making it longer than films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Dark Knight"". Is ""Boyhood"" too long? People might disagree with me, but I think it is. Probably at least 15 minutes could've been cut from Mason's scenes as a teenager. Not the early teenage years, but afterwards. This is where the film just kinda goes on and on. I doubt that making it somewhat shorter would ruin it.Is there a point to ""Boyhood""? Well, when I think back on my life over the last 12 years, I'm not sure if there's really a point to it. I'm also not sure if this film has one, but if you think it does, that's fine with me. Although I don't think ""Boyhood"" is a masterpiece, I'm glad I saw it and I admire the way it was filmed."
BOYHOOD,4 April 2018,6/10,"Boyhood is directed by Richard Linklater and is a film based on growing up through the transition of childhood to teenage-hood. It's not such a unique story although what makes Boyhood so special is the fact that it began filming and 2002 and ended in 2013. Every character in the film literally grows up right before your eyes, which is really awesome. So Boyhood starts with a reasonably compelling story which then develops, reaching such a climatic peak surrounding serious domestic conflict. But unfortunately this nearly 3hr long film doesn't continue to build beyond the halfway mark. When the male lead progresses into teenage-hood I feel the story really tanks. The remainder of the film is just bland and uneventful. The lead becomes an increasingly unlikable character. And the movie ends on such a low, with the lead attempting to have some philosophical view on life. Boyhood feels like watching the boring life audience members wish to escape from when seeing a film. This films lacks the emotional weight of other coming of age stories seen in films like Moonlight. Boyhood should just be seen for its achievement of filming for 11 years. It's unfortunate that the story falls short, so therefore I give Boyhood a 6."
BOYHOOD,3 May 2020,9/10,"In fact, this is not a movie, basically is an American TV series, because this film is not on the art of film or the edge of the film art, is the United States of Texas middle class trivial, dog blood life, the performance is almost as exaggerated as the American TV series. However, it's important to this, however, 6 years old to 18 years old, 12 years of time, no film could be so, but Lin guide dare under the hand, and the time to pile up, see there can be no last viewers don't ""self-injury origin"", beside me someone smile, someone sighing, someone to rub your eyes silently bowed head, I know this is director in the emotional, but was left so comfortable, in fact, to the end, really all faults can be forgiven."
BOYHOOD,19 August 2014,10/10,"I've heard some people say this film is boring. I've heard some people say this film was amazing. I've heard some people say this film is fake. I've heard some people say this film is not entertaining.I know this film made me change. Few times in my life I watch an American film in its entirety and come out satisfied. Don't get me wrong. I walk out of the cinema or sleep through many films because they lack a heart, a soul and, obviously, a good and well told story. There are tons and tons of films made in the States every year and only a few, maybe a couple, become something to remember... something that changes something inside you.Boyhood does all that and more. You may read a hundred other reviews that may tell the story. I think it's pretty well summarized in the synopsis.I will go into a different direction. This film is an achievement of LOVE. It took around 2 million bucks AND twelve years in the making!!! For me, this tells mostly what you will watch. A story so full of reality it becomes unbearable for the soul at moments. But, guess what? When things could hurt you (a lot) and you were expecting them to get really hard... switch! You're a couple of years ahead! They jumped the abyss unscathed! The sense of every day life it conveys, the muted tones of mostly everything, the nice things that could turn into a darker story, all lead to tell us life is as it is, and that life is the one that throws at us the magical moments that make it worth living. Take this film as one of these moments.I can read some of the words I wrote ten years ago and watch the films I wrote about, and I still feel and think the same as I did back then. I hope this film will become one of the few that make it in the list of the best-ever American films, and read this again ten years from now and be correct. You deserve to watch this film. It is a work of love packaged in a very small box (this film is, actually, short!)"
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,1/10,"I think back to this movie and have no feeling for it.Although I remember all of the scenes,there is no emotion or empathy that I feel.It was three hours of watching nothingness,in my opinion. I could have been watching my or my friends' life stories,but ours are probably more exciting than this ludicrous film. It was apparently filmed over twelve years. Why? They could have hired different actors as time went by and made this movie in a few months.I don't see it as artistic or unique in any way.A young boy grows up.Like all of us in different ways there are various issues;divorced parents,being bullied in high school,etc. So what? I compare this film to a fascinating British series called the ""Seven Up Series."" A small group of British children,aged seven,from various backgrounds and classes were interviewed. Every seven years,until aged fifty six,they were followed.Not all of them continued to participate later on, but most of them did.It was amazing to see what had happened to them in comparison to what their initial thoughts were when they were seven years old.I loved that series.It was clever,interesting,unique and I couldn't wait to see what had happened to these kids.In ""Boyhood"",by comparison,I couldn't care at all what happens to Mason,his sister,his mom played by Patricia Arquette or his dad,Ethan Hawk.I was left with an empty feeling. Why did I waste three hours watching this boring film which masquerades as art? Please,don't let it win best picture at the ""Golden Globes"" or""Oscar Awards"". I will be completely turned off Hollywood movies. Don't waste your money on this drivel.Watch it for free when it's on TV if you are really curious."
BOYHOOD,27 October 2014,9/10,"What do you remember most from growing up? Optimists tend to paint over the good old days with a surreal happy Technicolor. Where as pessimists see things clouded in regret and misfortune. Only the truly exceptional can remain unbiased in the eyes of the past and tell it as it was.Richard Linklater is that exceptional.I have been a long standing fan of Richard Linklater. In Slacker (1991), you feel like a fly on the wall taking in conversations amongst the colorful characters that help keep Austin Texas weird. If you haven't seen Slacker it is worth a look. Planted firmly in my all time top 10 list is Dazed and Confused (1993). I love it because it truly feels like being a teenager; driving around, listening to music, looking for women and beer. The plot consists of little more than that. Does Randy Floyd play quarter back that season, does he not? I think few people watching could care. Its all about the experience and the conversations. My high school scene happened 20 years after Dazed was set, but the heart and soul of it all rang true to me. Watching Dazed is like the character Wooderson reliving old glory days on the football field. Alright, alright, alright.In the film Boyhood, Richard Linklater takes us on a similar nostalgic journey. Only as with good wine this narrative had time to age for perfection. Shot over the span of 12 years, Boyhood follows its protagonist Mason, from age 5 to 18. Mason grows and matures along with the actor portraying him, and in no way less real. Richard Linklater uses his power of unbiased childhood recollection and weaves a brilliant narrative with highs, lows and moments of reflection. Never once does Linklater try to force a laugh, push you to cry or artificially create a Disney-esq moment. He simply lets life happen as it does. Linklater captures life, specific to being a boy in Texas. The culture of guns, religion, football, and politics are all accurately touched on.Richard Linklater tapped long time friend and go-to actor Ethan Hawk in the Roll as Mason's father. Hawk plays the role as the reluctant dad with understated brilliance. Patricia Arquet as the mother warrants an Oscar nod more than any other in this film. Working to provide the best life for her children, while doomed to carry them along the rocky road of her own personal struggles. Any one else recognize the liquor store clerk from Dazed reprise his role? Or recognize Mason Sr.'s second wife as the cute blonde girl from Wes Anderson's Bottlerocket?With this film Linklater takes his place amongst the great Texas born film makers, Robert Rodriguez and Wes Anderson. Each iconic and with a true grasp of their vision, making them true auteurs in the world of directing.With the amount of time and planning that Boyhood took it will be hard to recreate this level of movie magic on his next film. None the less, I wait in anticipation for the next Linklater film.If you enjoyed this review, check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"
BOYHOOD,3 February 2015,3/10,"Director Richard Linklater's 12 year project has concluded in the Oscar-nominated film Boyhood. Linklater has previously directed A Scanner Darkly, The Bad News Bears, School of Rock, Before Sunrise and Dazed and Confused. This is Linklater's first time being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director; it's his 3rd time being nominated for Best Writing. His previous 2 nominations were for Before Midnight and Before Sunset, which he co-wrote with Ethan Hawke who has also starred in many of his films. Hawke also stars in Boyhood as Mason's father. His performance has also earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is Hawke's 2nd acting Oscar nomination. He was previously nominated for his role in Training Day. Though neither Hawke nor Linklater have won an Oscar, Boyhood did earn the Golden Globe award for Best Director. In fact, Boyhood has been nominated for 6 Academy Awards. Patricia Arquette has been nominated for her performance as Mason's mother, and the film is also in the running for Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing.Boyhood is the literal coming-of-age story about a boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) as he grows from a 6 year old boy into an 18 year old man. The reason I say literal is because Linklater filmed Coltrane, Arquette and Hawke for days at a time over the 12 year period. We are allowed to witness Mason and his family not only go through things a normal growing boy would experience (love, divorce, step-parents, sibling rivalry, birthdays, graduations), but we also get to actually watch the family grow and age in this unique cinematic accomplishment.After watching the preview, I was hoping that the ""12 years in the making"" thing wasn't just a gimmick and that there was actually a movie worth all the hype waiting behind the title. I didn't go in with high hopes and only predicted 3.0 stars, but I was honestly disappointed. Boyhood is nominated for Best Writing, but it felt at times like a re-run of Saved By The Bell or an after school special. The dialogue didn't feel real. It felt forced and staged like a high school play. The film is also nominated for Best Editing, but I found it difficult at times to keep track of time passing throughout the movie. There didn't seem to be any consistency as to when time passed or how much time has passed. And it often took a minute to realize time has passed and then to have to figure out who the new characters are. Boyhood is over 2 and a half hours long, but I could have done with about an hour less of this movie that bored me for most of it. I'm giving it 1.5 stars as being barely worth renting and definitely not being a movie I would ever own. I give kudos to Linklater for the ambitious project, but Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas took over 3 years to make with only filming seconds a day due to meticulous and innovative stop-motion animation. Burton's film is still gaining new fans over 20 years later and is now both a Christmas and Halloween classic. I don't think the gimmick of Boyhood will sustain it for long. So, what movie will be on my mind next? We shall see."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,10/10,"Boyhood is one big roller coaster. But one that you're going to enjoy .Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes.This movie shocked me after I figured out that this movie was recorded in 12 years with the same cast. There is a lot of effort included in this movie. All the time you have been feeling like you're watching a documentary, not drama. Mason's grow up included all new and old trends like: XBOX, Nintendo, First Apple PC, that time popular music... But, of course, there are some family problems like; Mason's mom have changed three husbands, but her kids were happy with the first one (Ethan Hawke). The music in this movie is great. It changes in every part of Mason's life and music is getting newer and newer and finally, music that we have today.This movie is one big roller coaster, like I said in the beginning. You will enjoy it and after you watch it, you'll think about that movie, about everything what happened."
BOYHOOD,4 November 2014,1/10,"I get the hype, really. Linklater's Before trilogy was fantastic (I especially loved Before Midnight) and people were justified in expecting great things from Boyhood. What I don't get are the numerous and nearly uniformly raving reviews this film has been getting from the critics and everyone else. I'm utterly baffled by this. Critics are using words like masterpiece, monumental, profound and so on to describe this movie. The film is currently sitting at #58 on IMDb's Top 250. All this praise is making me feel like a crazy person because I felt Boyhood absolutely didn't deliver on the hype. In fact, the movie can't even be described as mediocre. I feel like I need to make on thing clear here. Just because Boyhood had the novel idea of shooting a film with the same actors during a long period of time doesn't grant it any automatic points. A novel idea or approach may pique my interest and convince me to see a movie but that's as far as it goes. We don't appreciate and enjoy movies simply because someone put some effort into them. There has to actually be something there to justify spending our precious time and money to watch pixels on a screen for a couple of hours. Now, let's jump into my gripes with the movie.Firstly, Boyhood has absolutely no distinct style. It is a lifeless husk without form or anything resembling a cinematic look. Just like one other reviewer put it, Boyhood felt like watching a home movie about someone you don't know and don't care about. I can't remember a single scene where I thought ""Wow, that's a neat shot"" or a moment where some cinematographic choice actually enhanced the scene. That tells a lot about the cinematographic effort and choices that were put into this film. Bland and uninspired is to put it mildly. The editing does the film no favors either. Right when something emotional or important could have happened, the movie simply cuts to another scene and doesn't reference or deal with what happened previously in any way. It all felt terribly directionless. For example, Mason (Ellar Coltrane) gets bullied in a school bathroom. Okay, great. Probably something many of us can identify with. How did it get to this? How does he deal with it later on and how does it affect him? We simply don't know. It's a wholly detached scene with no meaning. At one point they're planting Obama signs on people's lawns. Great, maybe they're idealistic about the political system and they'd later revise their views or something? Nope. None of that is ever mentioned or dealt with in any way again. Most of the scenes are like this and go absolutely nowhere. When the film actually goes back to something that was introduced earlier it feels extremely contrived like with the bit about Mason's mom advising a latino immigrant about going to school and how he later comes back to thank her for that encouragement. Really subtle guys!There were a few scenes where I was slightly amused (and that mostly about how awkward the scene was) but mostly I was just constantly cringing at how bad the acting and the writing were. I guess that's the risk you run into when you cast young actors and stay with them for twelve years - they might just not be that good at acting. Ellar Coltrane seemed like he'd had a shot of horse tranquilizer before every scene. He's that apathetic and dull. The characters have no real depth or character arcs and I didn't care or get attached to any of them. Mason's philosophic rants were cringe-worthy and uninteresting. They also seem to come out of nowhere and therefore feel unearned. At no point did I think that they really struck a chord with what it was like growing up during the 90s and the 2000s. I was simply depressingly bored for most of the movie. Many have complimented this movie about being close to real life. Well, that's debatable but that shouldn't be an automatic positive either. Watching paint dry and standing in the line in the grocery store is real life too. I don't want to see banal mindlessness when I go to the movies but maybe that's just me. A film this ambitious should really have something original to say. Instead it just wasted my time."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,2/10,"Having believed that this must be a 'special' film, I watched it. Having seen it... I am confused. I cannot identify anything 'special' about the film at all.The acting is average, the story is mundane... and it is so 'middle class' American, that it is almost entirely pointless to the rest of the world. Presumably, childhood only happens in America... and it is entirely made up of 'brooding', 'seething'... and being generally morose. All interspersed with alcoholic lunatics who have no 'back stories' of their own?Even if there was something to be learnt from a youth spent in the US... 'Wreck It Ralph' taught me far more than this pretentious piece of self indulgent nonsense ever could. The characterizations are clichéd, the 'kids' are tedious... and the events are interesting in the same way as going to a supermarket is. As in... not very. I give it 2 because of the possibility that I might have missed something even mildly engaging about this festival of American teen angst... but I am being generous.I don't like being the one to say so... but this is American self indulgence at it's very worst. An 'Oscar' nominee? Really...?'Cake' is 100 times the work of art this bore is."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,10/10,"Richard Linklater's Boyhood is the sort of movie I live for. Seldom does a movie significantly change the landscape of filmmaking in a way so grand in scope, yet so simple in delivery. Boyhood is a movie that crafts the most realistic representation of life into the boundaries of a 165 minute film, and it could have focused on just one aspect of life, but instead it perfectly encapsulates the idea of what it is like to grow up; the idea that everyone is familiar with and will most certainly relate to. The movie is not just about one thing alone, but in the end it is; it is about life itself.We follow young Mason, played extraordinarily by Ellar Coltrane, from the age of 6 to his first day of college. We do not have different actors playing the same characters, each of the actors were filmed annually for 12 years; there are no prosthetics, no extensive makeup, and no body doubles. I could try to give you a brief summary of all the major things he experiences in his life, but that would be taking away the magic of watching his life unfold before your very eyes. Almost every moment that you have experienced in life— no matter how mundane or unimportant— is up on screen for you to relive. From times when your parent told you to actually talk about your day instead of saying, ""It was OK,"" to ""the talk,"" to graduating college and leaving home, to falling in love and falling out of love, to that first day of school, to making friends and losing friends, and every moment you think you have forgotten; Boyhood has all these moments that might have seemed unimportant to us at the time, but they appear as milestones in the life of Mason.Coltrane is fantastic; even at the age of 6 he is great. His life is utterly absorbing; we became entranced by his life. Even if nothing huge is happening, we see him grow up in front of our eyes. There really is no equal to this type of experience—except maybe if you were to marathon all of the Harry Potter films. He is continuously changing before our eyes. His hair grows and is cut off; he gets taller and gets piercings. But, although his appearance changes, he remains the same type of person.Playing the older sister, and getting far less recognition than Coltrane, is Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei. From early childhood to her teenage years, she is the one who bugs her brother, but also accompanies him along for the ride, just like any good sibling would do.His mother in the film, played exceptionally by Patricia Arquette, is a woman who is struggling to raise her two kids on her own. She is flawed, though; she has a hot temper and continuously picks the wrong man, but she is what a mother should be: thoughtful and caring. She cares for her children and does whatever she can do to make it by and let them live a happy life.His dad (played by Ethan Hawke in one of his best roles) though caring as he may be, is divorced from their mother for obvious reasons. He is always fun, spontaneous, and wants nothing but to be a family again. He is always there for his weekends, and always tries to show his kids the best time possible.The film is set to what is essentially a ""greatest hits"" of the 2000s. Linklater, who is famous for his soundtracks, uses music in this movie as an indicator of the time. From early scenes featuring Brittney Spears and Coldplay, to final moments with Foster the People and Arcade Fire, the movie contains an amazing soundtrack.As someone who only just recently passed the age at the end of the film, there are so many references to my childhood that makes this film hit even harder than it does for those older. It is imbued with memories of watching Dragonball Z after school while laying on the floor, playing Halo with friends, anxiously anticipating the next Harry Potter book, talking about the possibilities of another Star Wars, and many more. Anybody who has just started college should see this movie to see their childhoods flash before their eyes.Boyhood is basically shot in a series of episodes, with each year or so being a new chapter in the story. But there are no dramatic cuts to future scenes, there are no subtitles that explain what year it is; the years bleed together like they do for anyone. We do not live life as a series of chapters, we live at it as one long story, not quite knowing where one chapter begins and the other ends, and we are only given a brief glimpse in the life of a boy growing up. By the end of the film I wanted to see more. I wanted to see what he would do in his life, who he would marry, what his kids would be like. I wanted to watch all the way up until his final moments. But sadly that is an impossibility, and we are left to wonder where life takes him.Twelve years ago, making this movie must have seemed like a huge gamble. There were so many things that could go wrong in 12 years. Someone could have died or quit, funding could have fallen through, or Linklater could have realized what he was making was complete garbage. There are a million reasons why this movie could not have worked out, it somehow worked out perfectly, and we are left with a truly cinematic masterpiece, a movie that will go down as one of the best of the year, maybe even of our generation. It is a truly and wholly unique and magical experience. It is a perfect movie.ragingfilm.com"
BOYHOOD,2 October 2014,9/10,"12 years in the making is a bold move, my friend. I don't see many movies like that. It must be scary to worry if something bad happened during production and those years were wasted. Anyways, the movie has that formula we've all seen before, growing up is tough, life is tough, and keep on truckin'. But what made this special is they had the balls to tell a story of a boy and his 12 year journey in the real world by actually filming it for 12 years. That takes a lot of effort and courage. The movie isn't too concerned about plot but more of an experience and realistic ups and downs of the real world using the same actors for over a decade. All in all, it was interesting. Great acting, great cinematography, great accomplishment.So far, it's the best movie I've seen this year. Well done."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,10/10,"I am truly flabbergasted by the dedication and passion of Richard Linklater to create a film in such a long, true time, period. It is unbelievable how passionate someone must be to completely give himself in a such a project. Is it true art? What is really true art? A dedicated director perhaps that carries an inextinguishable flame? To me what makes this film so unbelievably beautiful, about a boy's life, his family and friends, in a period of 12 years, that actually took the exact time to shoot, it is this exact thing. Using the same actors as basic characters, keeping the film and the idea behind alive in their hearts, making them offer themselves to that project shows the directors straightforwardness and transmissibility. Life is life! It includes pain, happiness, dreams, disappointment, fear, every variety of feelings we all know and have experienced and will keep be experiencing. In Boyhood you see them and feel them once again side by side with the boy that becomes an adult, with his sister and friends. Also his mother that she's still trying to find her place in the world!You had me from lying on the grass..."
BOYHOOD,29 August 2014,4/10,"Watching Boyhood, there was nothing to keep me interested.I like slow movies in general, but if a movie is not exciting it should have interesting characters or good acting or clever writing or perceptive ideas or an intriguing atmosphere or beautiful cinematography or emotional scenes, or at the very least make the viewer feel like they are in good company.Boyhood has none of that. It feels long and boring. The acting is very wooden. The lead seems to have an extremely limited emotional range. He can play vaguely amused to mildly irritated, and that's about it. He even seems to get worse as an actor as he gets older. There's no character progression for the main people. The lead starts off as a lazy boy and grows into a lazy adult. His parents change a bit, I suppose, but not in a hugely insightful way. His dad starts off a transient and ends up settling down. Inspirational! His mom apparently needs a masters degree in order to get a job, and begins and ends her scenes in the movie in fits of unhappiness. How is she going to find meaning in her life? No one really cares. Did anyone actually write a script for this film?I know that it supposed to be like ""real life, man!"" but even then it fails. Two drunken step-fathers? Isn't one enough? That Mexican guy who, because of one patronizing remark from the mom, suddenly becomes the manager of a fancy restaurant? Even the main guy looked unconvinced in that scene. Real life has bumps and curve balls, dark nights of the soul, and moments of extreme beauty and joy. In real life people have to deal with hard choices. And other people tell stories about these choices, called movies, with little things called plots, and character arcs!A deliberately mundane film like Boyhood demeans the whole art form of film-making. What's even scarier is that most people like it."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,1/10,"Awhile back I submitted a script into a writing contest, and I paid to receive feedback. I was told my movie lacked conflict; that I needed to expand on some of the drama, or incorporate something new to conflict with my protagonist. I guarantee if I were to have written Boyhood and entered that into the same writing contest, the film never would have been made. In my opinion, Boyhood is the worst nominated film I've ever seen. I am perplexed by the nominations. I do not feel Hawke and Arquette's performances are even close to nomination-worthy. I will say those who are looking for a film that breaks Hollywood norms where nobody dies, this may be a refreshing change.I thought at one point (during the only dramatic sequence) that this film was trying to take a page out of This Boy's Life, but it was a feeble attempt. Note that I don't watch previews, so I went into Boyhood with an open mind. I almost didn't watch b/c I felt there'd be some tragedy with a boy dying, and I was reluctant to want to see that. But now after watching, I wish there were some drama like that, because Boyhood offered me nothing. It was 2 1/2 hours of my life that I'll never get back."
BOYHOOD,13 September 2014,2/10,"What a great concept! Filming a movie over the course of twelve years with the same actors, we get to watch them age, and so on. From there........? Movie starts out with blatant Bush-Bashing, by Hawke's character, going so far as to having his kids put Obama signs on lawns, and stealing McCain signs.But wait a second- Hawke's character is a worthless, jobless, layabout who mooches off others, so maybe it's PERFECT that he was an Obama supporter? I just thought of that.Anyway, if this was a normal movie, filmed over a normal time frame, it would never been made in the first place.Imagine someone watching twelve year's worth of your home movies, condensed into three hours, and you get the gist.Traces family over the course of twelve years, but almost NOTHING HAPPENS! No comedy, no tragedy, no drama, no NOTHING, just a family and their son getting twelve years older. No one to really root for or against, just, well, I don't know. Imagine the ""Housewives of New Jersey,"" minus the screaming or shouting, but just a bunch of slightly annoying broads just going about the business of life; that's twelve years long, and you get to watch them all age. Or a twelve-year long episode of a modern-day, ever-so-slightly dysfunctional ""Brady Bunch,"" crammed into three hours maybe? Bingo! Ending, if you want to call it that, tells viewer NOTHING. It's as if the director said, ""alright, 12 years is enough, let's get the hell out of here."" Veeeery long, drawn out, and every scene could have been completed in HALF the time, without missing a beat.Not getting the positive reviews."
BOYHOOD,25 July 2014,5/10,"I suspect most boyhoods actually consist of far more drama / up and down moments than we are presented with here. It's a long film and I'm not sure there was a need for that as it didn't seem to have enough to say about a boyhood.The filmed over a 12 year concept is interesting but to me I'm not sure if the result was worth the effort. We move between phases of Mason's life in a slightly vague manner. Perhaps that is the intention but you often get the feeling of unfinished business watching the film and you also think almost constantly something dramatic is going to happen, which never really does. In fact my own boyhood had far more up and down moments. There were moments when I was a lot happier than Mason and there were moments I was a lot sadder. Mason seems like a very quiet observer. The film does not explore those more extreme states of a childhood at all it seems. Instead it seems to meander along a slightly safe and dull route with the children growing up to be kind of uninteresting and ultimately even annoying characters I think.Well made for what it is but ultimately I thought it was disappointing and not worth watching again."
BOYHOOD,20 November 2014,,"A movie is made for almost 12 years and the characters in that movie are shown to be growing / aging in real-time throughout those 12 years and the result is a masterpiece called "" Boyhood "". Richard Linklater has made the movie of a lifetime ( nearly a quarter of a lifetime literally). One must admire the director's chutzpah for he has managed to retain every single member of the cast since the filming of the movie began till about time filming was completed. And he has weaved pure magic.As the movie progresses a lot of real life ""newsworthy"" events that actually happened during the times the movie was being shot have been actually taken into consideration. These events act like indicators of the fact that time is progressing.Every single member of the cast has given an impeccable performance and has contributed towards making the director's vision come true. Ellar Coltrane is the protagonist. His growth from a five year old child to a matured young man has been shown in a beautiful manner. His sister is played by the director's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater. Her journey to adulthood is shown in a similar fashion. Their mother is played by Patricia Arquette and her struggles through life and the hardships she faces in order to support two children have been shown effectively. And last but not the least, we get to see Ethan Hawke playing a fantastic supporting role."" Boyhood "" has been made in a way no other movie has been made before. For his patience and self-confidence, the director has to be rewarded. I hope he gets an Oscar nod besides winning many more awards. This movie deserves a lot more than just box-office success."
BOYHOOD,2 August 2020,5/10,Waited to see this film for years thinking it was going to be something special and it was totally unoriginal and uninspiring. The acting was good but that was about the only thing I liked about this film. Wondering why it got so much attention
BOYHOOD,15 September 2018,10/10,"So i have to say that this film surprised me as being an oddly charming story. The film follows a boy named mason from the age of 6 to 18 filmed over 12 years, I praise this film for being very experimented and well executed. Yes the film was a bit plotless, but that's what made this film relatable to everyday life and different to most over the top films. The child acting was suprisingly good apart from masons sister who was a bit annoying, the adult actors were great as well as the scenery used in this film. The film was a perfect mix between comedy, serious drama and romance. I would personally feel sorry for the producers if I didn't like this film as they spent so long making it."
BOYHOOD,10 September 2014,2/10,"Credit where credit is due for not making an empty, soulless movie. And as a Linklater fan, it pains me to write this, but...If this movie is about 30 scenes or so, I'd say about 27 of them are pure melodrama, with unbearable and performatory acting. Whatever Linklater meant to champion in making this, beyond the premise of following a kid for 12 actual years, he failed. Specifically, he failed to dig into what could have made these melodramatic scenes insightful or fresh.I'm glad this is not the first Linklater movie I saw. He has a way of making a great movie out of simple virtues. Here, he misfired."
BOYHOOD,25 September 2021,3/10,"It's really just a clip show put together, where is the action, and character development. One of the most overrated films of all time."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,2/10,"Well, OK, the idea of using the same actors for 12 years and blah blah blah is surely original, no question. Even unique, I'd daresay. That given, what is left in this movie? Nothing. Almost 3 hours where nothing at all happens. I watched it with my girlfriend, and after half an hour she had already spotted the reality and said: ""Listen to me, nothing is going to happen in this movie, we'll just see 3 hours of ordinary, everyday life as the people in the film get older"". I replied that it couldn't be like that, that something just HAD to happen. Oh, woe is me, how wrong was I!During the last half hour I wasn't even watching it anymore, I was just minding my own business, letting my mind gallop in the fields of daydreaming, just to make that joke of a movie pass by as little painfully as possible. Believe me, it's just like watching one of those time-lapse videos where somebody takes a picture of himself a day for a few years and then mounts them together in a video. The amount of things happening in this movie is very close to that.Avoid at all costs, save yourself 3 hours, use them to do more interesting things, such as doing the dishes, ironing clothes, going to toilet, what-the-hell-ever. You've been warned. Don't say you weren't."
BOYHOOD,10 May 2015,9/10,"Richard Linklater is quickly becoming one of my very favourite directors. I first became aware of him when I was blown away by Before Sunrise and its following sequels which are all amazing.. (check em out!) I had been meaning to watch this for quite a while now and had high expectations which were all met..My biggest curiosity was how the scenes would transition given it 12 years of production but wow, the movie flowed so seamlessly.... It was actually fascinating to see all the characters grow older as the movie progressed and the movie was so well structured that it was never dull for a moment. The reason for this was that the dialogue and actors were all absolutely excellent.Lorelei Linklater (Richards daughter) was hilarious, Ethan Hawke was a really cool father figure, Patricia Arquette had so much heart and gave one of her best performances of her career and the main star Ellar Coltrane did a stunning job considering he hadn't many other acting credits. There were even more stunning performances aside from this.The film summed up boyhood pretty well, everything was there between the good, the bad and the ugly moments of life.Overall: A stunning portrait of life. A film like this will probably never be made again! You know you gotta seek it out...."
BOYHOOD,29 January 2015,10/10,"Just saw this movie tonight. It was really good. Richard Linklater also did the ""Before Sunrise, ...Sunset...Midnight"" films, and there are thematic similarities and at least one actor overlapping.But it was really good--using the same actors over a 10-15 year period was kind of a novelty--genuinely showed the real kids growing up, but the adult actors could have done it all at one time with kind of minimal makeup adjustment. Kids change more. The film ends with the main character--the guy--spacing out on mushrooms in college while a cute girl hits on him and he doesn't get it, because he's stoned. A sweet ending.But it's the overall story that makes it real--all the characters lives and ups and downs--told in fragmentary flashes--like real life. Usually these themes are dealt with in very soapy dumb terms in made-for-TV movies. Great to see something real instead.Patricia Arquette --the Mom--is very convincing. Her story made me think of a bunch of people we know. Women in America go through a lot. Also I never realized what large breasts she has. Guess they're real--or is this part of her ""character'?This movie is a two and one-half hour commitment, but worth it. I recommend you watch the more concentrated and shorter ""Before Midnight"" movie first--that is a very fun film, and very real."
BOYHOOD,9 April 2014,,"Once a year, over the last 12 years, Richard Linklater ('Waking Life' / 'Before Sunset') has reunited the same cast and shot segments of a feature film following the life of a boy (played by Ellar Coltrane – who literally grew into this part and became an actor of substance) from the age of 5 through the age of 18; the result is both fascinating and inspired. The only other project that comes close in comparison is Michael Apted's 'Seven Up' series which documents the lives of a collection of school children in 7-year intervals, starting in 1964 and still going as of the latest edition in 2012. What's so unique about 'Boyhood' is that these individuals (including Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater) evolve and age within a scripted narrative that is not 'like' a time capsule, this is a completely authentic period piece that retraces an era from the cultural response to September 11th, through the election of Barrack Obama, and into the age of social media saturation. As you watch these actors morph through more than a decade of their lives within a few hours, the story becomes as engaging as its concept. Throughout my life and travels, I've heard so little enthusiasm for Linklater outside of Austin and it's a shame because he is a unique force within the industry and quite an American gem. The director received a well-deserved standing ovation from SXSW's elated audience having, once again, set a new standard in the exploration of film's potential and reinforcing the limitlessness of DIY filmmaking."
BOYHOOD,24 September 2014,10/10,"Believe the hype. Richard Linklater's Boyhood is a masterful film; a miraculous achievement that is not like anything that has gone before it. The audacity of the project in itself is one thing, but the execution is exemplary. This is a movie that realises the potential of film as a story telling medium, tracking the lives of the various characters over 12 years in a wonderful exploration of growing up in America. Of course, Boyhood isn't the first film in which a story has spanned such a period of time – heck, some films cover hundreds of years – but it is the first film to do so in real time. Shooting just 4 or 5 days a year over 12 years, Linklater has crafted a film that has more in common with documentary productions such as Michael Apted's Up series than it does with other fictional films. This is the filmmaking equivalent of a tightrope without a safety net and, given the potential for the project to fall apart at any time should anybody involved decide to walk away, what Linklater and his collaborators have achieved is nothing short of remarkable and the finished product is a credit to all those who committed themselves to this unique undertaking.Linklater is a talented director whose films have often drawn praise from critics without ever necessarily securing audience support or industry recognition at the level they perhaps deserve. From the likes of Slacker and Dazed and Confused – both of which play out in a 24-hour time period – to the animated innovation of Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, to music comedy School of Rock or the much more serious Fast Food Nation or the Before trilogy (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, Before Midnight), a series which also collectively track the lives of characters over any years – albeit with significant gaps in time – Linklater has proved himself an accomplished and eclectic filmmaker. At face value Boyhood is such a simple premise; ostensibly about a boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his life experiences as he grows up. However, there is much more going on here for viewers as we connect the highs and the lows of Mason's very recognisable life with similar moments and milestones from our own experiences. To watch Mason develop from a somewhat typical 6-year-old into a young man of quiet intelligence is fascinating and it is very easy to forget that what we are seeing is not real, despite the recognisable faces amongst the cast. Interestingly, Linklater avoids all the big moments upon which more typical films would focus. There is no plot as such, but plenty happens as life ebbs and flows through changing relationships, homes, jobs, schools and physical appearances; just like real life. There are moments of great humour, heartbreak and the inevitable awkwardness that permeates parent-child relationships (such as conversations about sex) and it is enormous credit to the cast that it all works so remarkably well as a piece of entertainment.Coltrane is splendid in the lead role and both Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke deliver superbly nuanced performances as Mason's parents, perhaps career-best turns from both. Even Linklater's daughter Lorelei impresses as older sister Samantha. These characters, their experiences and their relationships seem real; these are very normal people, a rarity on cinema screens. None of the characters are perfect – Arquette's Olivia repeatedly makes bad calls in her choice of men, while Hawke's Mason Snr takes a long time to grow up – but they are utterly likable and spending time with them is a joy. There are myriad supporting characters who play roles of varying import in the lives of the characters at particular moments, such as Olivia's husbands (Marco Perella and Brad Hawkins), Mason's high school girlfriend Sheena (Zoe Graham) or Mason Snr's new wife Annie (Jenni Tooley). Even Charlie Sexton, one-time guitar prodigy and long-time member of Bob Dylan's backing band, also features in the ensemble as Mason Snr's rocker roommate.Linklater possesses the ability to capture the youth experience better than most other filmmakers and that is on display again here as we witness the various interactions and experiences that Mason has in his journey towards adulthood. Whilst full of music, pop culture and political references that signpost the various points in history during the 12 years of production – iPods, Obama, Harry Potter, Star Wars – the film is never maudlin and never privileges one particular period in time over another. In fact, Boyhood is an utter joy from start to finish and the running time in excess of 2.5 hours seems mere minutes because you so much treasure the time spent in the company of these characters. In fact, I never wanted it to end."
BOYHOOD,3 December 2018,1/10,"I'm a huge fan of some of Linklater's stuff, but this film really is a giant swing and a miss.If you're going to have a long movie with virtually no story, you can't gamble on a hope that random child actors will grow into great actors. The adults, especially Hawke and Arquette, are professionals. But the movie centers so much around young people who you eventually realize just can't act.Films like Dazed and Confused or the Before series work because they rely on first-rate performances to carry it along. Had they not had those performances, the films would be awful. They would essentially be what Boyhood is. Except Boyhood is uniquely directionless and pointless. I'd heard that they didn't really write a story. They just made stuff up as they went along. And that's precisely what the film feels like.I was tempted to give this film a higher score for the very interesting gimmick of time-lapse they use and the superb acting of Hawke. But honestly, judging the film as a whole, it's an absolute mess. It has to be a 1-star, because it literally fails to do what a film is supposed to do. It fails at entertaining and fails at saying something important.If you'd like to see a LOONG film with no plot, awful young actors, and a predictable message about how young people are trying to figure life out and can't quite figure it out, then you'll love this film."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2014,4/10,"Don't get me wrong, I like all kind of movies even those, which don't really have a story, just having a mood and going on and on, but this one I couldn't watch till the end.I got out at half.Why would I want to watch some strange kid's not even real shitty, just simply regular and boring life, when I had the same experiences during MY life, just with different ""actors""? It's not just that it has no story, but it doesn't even give you anything. A moral lesson, or satisfaction or small wins over life situations or anything.For example the two jerks in the toilet in the school. They appear, they are jerks, they disappear and never come back. WHY? Why were they even in the movie?The ""bad guys"" are not even that bad, that they were enough for good drama. They are just regular guys with faults.Save yourself the time and the money and go watch something else. Or if you want to watch it, just download/rent or buy the DVD and watch it in your most comfortable chair, so you can start another movie any time, because you would regret driving miles to the cinema, when you have to drive back home with that disappointment."
BOYHOOD,18 November 2021,4/10,I don't understand the good critics. This boy is the least interesting character I have seen in a movie for a very long time! He has no personality! Everyone around him is a lot more interesting than himself. He only goes from one stereotype to another as he grows older. But where is his own true character? He doesn't have one.
BOYHOOD,6 January 2015,,"I've read great review after another for this film. I was very excited to get to watch it finally and I love Ethan Hawke & Patricia Arquette, so I fully expected to love it as well. It was an EPIC let down for me. At first it was so awful, I just wanted to stop the movie. The writing is uninteresting to say the least. But more than bad writing, the filming style or editing (not a film person so not sure which) was horrible! There are absolutely no indications or transitions between scenes - even ones that skip ahead many years. At 36 minutes into the movie, there was finally a scene that was watchable (without horrible child acting and constant screaming). It was a good scene but no better than any other movie with a decent scene. I kept watching to try and understand what the hype is all about but throughout it all, there was apx. 20 mins or so of decent watchable dialogue and acting. There were a couple of touching, father and son scenes - but again, no better than an average movie with the same type of scene (and likely better writing). The whole time you are watching it, you are thinking about the making of it, as opposed to getting into the movie. My conclusion: I think its one of those cool things some film maker tries that is new or different (filming it over the years with same actors as they grew up), so people rave on and on about it. But bottom line is that the writing and directing was extremely weak and most of the actors in it were weak as well. It was an interesting concept and storyline that was horribly executed.and for 3 hours of it, ugh!"
BOYHOOD,3 May 2014,10/10,"There is something people should know before watching this movie, and that is that it takes place from 2002 to 2014. I grew up in that same generation, so as I watched this movie I felt like I was growing up all over again seeing the references to pop culture, society, politics, middle school, high school, and technology. It was incredible to experience that. And even for those who weren't children growing up in those 12 years will still feel a sense of going back in time. There was not one moment that I thought wasn't needed. In fact, I and the rest of the audience wished there had been more going on. The plot is very simple: what does it mean to grow up, become an adult, and live? And as the years go by, it becomes apparent that Mason (the main character) is struggling to find his place in life. Though there are a few struggles he encounters and some thematic material, overall the movie is hilarious and real. From Richard Linklater's previous films, I've noticed that the dialogue all feels real (to a point where I feel like I'm interacting with the characters). And it is so well done in this film. Speaking of Linklater, I see an Oscar nomination for directing coming his way. As he sat down for Q&A on Boyhood, one of the things he said that struck the audience was that he thought it was funny that people who saw ""Boyhood"" told him he improved as a director. This was funny to him because one of the first rules he made before filming in 2002 was that he could not change as a director for the sake of the movie to have no continuity errors (especially so the tone didn't change). The only improvement going on is the superb acting from Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and (of course) Ellar Coltrane. With probably the best ending I've ever seen for a movie and a story guided by a talented director, ""Boyhood"" is the most powerful and unique coming-of-age film ever made and it will be proclaimed as a classic for the years to come."
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,5/10,"I certainly am an outlier here as most reviews are either 1 or 10. But although it has a lot of good qualities, I found myself reading a book during it to pass the time. I guess if it didn't have a lot of boring times it wouldn't be real.Great acting, well directed and an interesting concept. It did bring out a lot of ""been there, done that"" moments but a lot of it was like watching some other family's home movies. The only rough sea parts were the various alcoholic husbands who were typical of every Hollywood portrayal of alcoholics. I have an 18 year old son and found the lead actor's portrayal very convincing. So, if you have the time (almost 3 hours) and in the right mood, it can be a enjoyable watch. But have a book handy, just in case."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,4/10,"This film, so far, is the most disappointing of the Oscar nominated films in my opinion. I'm now convinced that people are simply hung up on the gimmick of this thing being filmed over 12 years.So what?You still have to make a film that is interesting, has compelling characters, and has some substance and plot to it. Overall, films need to provide entertainment. This film had none of those. My life would have been more interesting than this one. Even though we experience 12 years in the lives of the central characters, I still felt like I barely knew them. Maybe that was the point. To me this felt like a reality show with some pretty boring people. Yes, his mother made bad choices in husbands. There was some drama in husband #2 with the drinking and abuse. But 15 minutes of drama does not make a nearly 3 hour film relevant. I'm not sure I understand the hype over this film."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2016,9/10,"Boyhood is a 2014 coming-of-age drama film directed by Richard Linklater and star Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. Boyhood is often seen as not only one of the greatest films of all time, but also one of the most ingenious and best produced films from a filmmaking point of view. Boyhood tells the story of Mason Evans Jr, a regular boy growing up during the early 21st Century and showing his growth and change throughout the years. While the plot may seem simplistic and common, its the way the film was made is why it has huge critical acclaim. Boyhood took twelve years to create with filming beginning in 2002 and finally finishing in 2014, over these twelve years the same actors are used to show the ageing and journey of these people. This method of filmmaking is revolutionary, unique and masterfully handled with the film having an extremely realistic feel, especially from Ellar Coltrane-we feel like we literally watch him grow up and live his life. We follow the ups and downs, good times and bad times, the relationships flourish and crumble and watch how Mason develops and grows not only as a character but also as a human being. Boyhood does have but one or two flaws in that some scenes seem to be roughly joined together rather than freely flowing, this unfortunately resulting in moments of wandering about characters and events that were skipped over or cut short, we also feel slightly detached from Mason himself by the end in which he seems to become more monotone and dull, compared to the exciting youthful years we got to experience in the first half of the film. Overall, Boyhood really is a one of a kind film, with a beautiful realistic approach to presenting a life, interesting relationships and scenarios and the magnificent and groundbreaking filmmaking techniques. 9/10"
BOYHOOD,28 July 2014,10/10,"I was not a huge fan of Richard Linklater's ""Before"" movies. I found them too self-consciously precious for my taste and, frankly, Julie Delpy just annoys me. Still, the notion of the passage of time and how we all change, even though we so often deny it, is fascinating. It's why Michael Apted's ""Up"" series of documentaries have been so compelling.In that context, I approached Boyhood with mixed feelings, but there was no need to be ambivalent. I have very rarely had a more rewarding experience in the movie theatre. Virtually everything about this film is pitch perfect. The concept itself was pretty audacious. So much could have gone wrong and ruined the whole thing - Ellar Coltrane could have simply abandoned the project or he could have turned out to be a lousy actor (as could Lorelei Linklater). The producers could have lost faith in what must surely have seemed a fool's errand. The fact that is is just so beautifully, and believably, put together is nothing short of a small miracle.I watched the film with my 21 year-old son and we lost track of the number of times we turned to each other in silent recognition of our own journey together as father and son. As with life itself, Boyhood has its moments of unintended humour, of awkward attempts to connect, of unexpressed anger, alienation and love. There are no artificially manufactured scenes of overt drama. Nothing really bad happens, despite what I found to be a prolonged sense of foreboding.In short, this is a movie that know I will watch again and again, each time taking something more away from it. It is an unforgettable experience."
BOYHOOD,12 September 2014,10/10,"For a production that was filmed in brief 3-day periods across more than a decade, 'Boyhood' flows remarkably well. We're introduced to a 7-year-old Mason, who gradually evolves into an 18-year-old college student across the course of the narrative, in a way that feels natural and authentic, almost convincing you that you're watching a documentary rather than a fictional account of a boy's adolescence. In a beautifully paced manner, Mason experiences many of the things that most children growing up would encounter in some form or another: moving homes, embarrassing birds-and-bees discussions, and high-school romances. The important thing is that these experiences are displayed in a believable way, one that can still completely draw the audience's attention and interest. This authenticity and realism carries on into both the cast and the screenplay. Even though they are portraying fictional characters, you really couldn't say that any of the cast members, particularly Mason Jr. and his sister Samantha (portrayed by Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater), were really acting. More so they were projecting their real- life coming-of-age experiences through these characters. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, who play the two kids' parents, likewise don't appear as if they're acting at all, as they have literally spent 12 years on this project, watching Ellar and Lorelei grow up and reacting to these changes as such. Running at nearly three hours, I never thought 'Boyhood' was outstaying its welcome. Much rather, I could have spent another three watching Mason grow into his thirties. 'Boyhood' perfectly captures the inevitable mental and physical growth that every human experiences before reaching adulthood. In addition, director/screenwriter Richard Linklater is able to flawlessly introduce warmth, humor and in parts tragedy, all in a genuine, believable way, with great dialogue and contemporary soundtrack choices. Fingers crossed, in maybe 12 years time we'll see a film called 'Manhood' pop up. Must-see viewing, and a serious contender for Best Picture at the next Oscars."
BOYHOOD,16 July 2014,10/10,"Cinematic history was made with this movie. What I love about it was the simplicity behind it. It didn't have any big moments and it wasn't some big blockbuster drama. It was a slice of life, plain and simple. It contained sequences parallel to those of every kid's life in one way or another which really makes the movie connect with everyone that watches it. Despite what you may think, the story isn't all about Mason, but everything he experiences. The story is more about family, friends, and living in the moment rather than just focusing on one theme. These different themes are symbolized through looks, gestures, and other subtleties throughout the 12 year journey. Overall, I loved the movie and I hope you all like it too."
BOYHOOD,17 February 2015,8/10,"I enjoyed every part of this movie, it was really amazing its like watching some real life growing up(which it was). This movie is made in a 12/13 year period and goes around the life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18. I must say that at one scene I thought that the child might grow up suddenly and there would be a text displaying that after some time and another actor have take place as adult Mason but it didn't happened and that was the very best thing about this movie.The acting was really good specially of Ethan Hawke's as Dad and it was amazing they all did pretty good. This movie really tells us how things changed when you grow up, some thing you are in control of and in some things you aren't, its a natural thing. Its really a good contender for Best Picture at this 2015 Academy Awards."
BOYHOOD,4 October 2014,4/10,"The movie is pretentious, and BOY were the critics HOODwinked. Boyhood attempts to impress by attaching such earnest importance to everything. And make the kids REAL...so REAL you want to reach into the screen and give them a hug. I was supposed to care, care so much... well, why didn't I? I don't know...when you make a movie about a boy growing up, SOMETHING extraordinary has to happen, right? It's a movie! I kept waiting...NOTHING happened that doesn't happen every second to a whole lot of ordinary people.Don't lose hope that a movie can be made out of your life, because it was made out of these very ordinary people's lives. Is this why the critics loved it, because they got such a rare glimpse into the lives of the ordinary? I just don't get the hype. I had wished that for once someone could make a movie about boring people, like me. But no, the protagonist is always somebody special in some way, and the supporting actors are so good-looking. Well I'm not special. In fact I'm Nobody Special. Why didn't somebody make a movie out of my life? Now that Boyhood sort of granted me my wish, I'm going to be more careful what I wish for. How could anyone sit there for 3 hours and be enthralled by run-of-the-mill? That's where the pretension comes in...trying to elevate run-of-the-mill to a heroic level. The everyperson as hero. Yeah, that's why the critics liked it it maybe. I didn't buy it. Well, I bought the ticket. Then walked out 90 minutes later."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,9/10,"Boyhood (2014):The unbelievable continues story line is really incredible to watch and the experience is appallingly joyful.As the guy in the movie grows up, the movie itself grows too. It felt like it went uphill.However, due to the complexity time-line in the story, it may can be confusing at sometimes. Also, you can't really attach to a situation or something, because it kept changing as time goes by in the life of the family we've been following.In the other hand, it also is references as something completely normal if you trying to tell a story about a persons life in that many years.It is a beautiful accomplishment in making something memorable and a unique achievement in writing and telling a story about someone's life.Review by: Brendan Resnick."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2021,7/10,"For a movie that took over a decade to make, I expected a little more. By no means was it terrible, but the plot was essentially the same as any other coming of age movie. I'm not going to waste time naming all of its good parts, so here are my problems with Boyhood.First, the character development. Aside from Patricia Arquette (who was absolutely phenomenal), all the characters remained very one dimensional. Especially Mason, who kept the same philosophical perspective on life in every single scene. I would have liked to have seen him try new things and experiment a little more.Also, in the beginning of the film, it felt like the actors had never seen the script before. Much of the dialogue felt very unnatural. The younger actors eyes darted around a little too much, but that's understandable considering how young they were.My third problem is about the script. When Mason and his sister were still very young, all the adults talked to them as if they were in their 20s. After awhile it started to become annoying, and was a continuous reminder that it was just a movie.Overall, it was a good movie with a few faults. I wish Richard Linklater had spent a little more time working on certain scenes. This movie is relatable to people at all different points in life."
BOYHOOD,8 August 2014,9/10,"There has never been a movie quite like this in history. I can only imagine the process it took to create this ""12 Year Epic."" There were so many variables, all of which could've gone completely wrong. Director Richard Linklater delivers us his best movie yet in such a way that's never been done before.I am sixteen years old. After a month of waiting for the local theater to have a show time, my friend and I went in a heartbeat. We were the youngest people in the theater and most of the other audience members were older. But don't be fooled; despite the R rating, this is a movie that was made for everyone, of any age. You watch these people grow up and change, literally; there is no make-up involved. There is always someone on screen who you can identify yourself with. For me, it was Mason (Ellar Coltrane). Watching him grow up reminded me of myself; it was like a mirror. The same could be said for the parents of Mason (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke). They change and grow as characters and as people. Only real life parents with children could fully understand the emotions and feelings they go through. There is something different about keeping in touch with the same people for twelve years that separates this movie from others. For example, Goodfellas (another excellent movie) told an amazing story spanning decades but the actors didn't age with their characters; it was just make-up. It didn't feel real and it constantly brought you out of the movie.Having such incredible actors grow and change with their characters made the world of difference. Everything was real. The way society changed throughout the years in this post 9-11 world was incredibly interesting. Real life events were captured on camera and were presented like they had just happened. Seeing the mother read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to her children at a young age and then seeing those same children a few years older at the opening of the sixth book was something magical and something that could only be created in the way that it was. Something even as small as seeing Mason play his Gameboy as a kid but then ten years later he pulls out his iPhone like a normal everyday kid would do was pleasurable. It's this kind of authenticity that brought a greater emotional punch to Boyhood.By the end of the movie you will have a real personal connection with the characters. You don't want to let them go but you have to. They move on, just like us. The film challenges you emotionally and spiritually; it made me reflect on my own life in ways that very few others have. It might've even changed me.Overall, this is an absolute must watch film. I would probably place it in my top ten of all time and top two of the year so far (2014 has been very kind to us). The only reason I kept from giving it a perfect ""10"" was because there was a bit of story material in the first hour of the film that felt a little cliché but eventually worked out magnificently. Perhaps on a second viewing I wouldn't be so harsh and change my score but for now it is what it is.Don't miss out on this one. It's where cinema and art meet and create something that is only possible on film. It pleases me that films like this are still being made. This is what cinema is all about: losing yourself in a different world and forgetting the rest. This is truly something remarkable and rare, I can't enforce this enough. Listen to the reviews and the hype; it deserves all of it."
BOYHOOD,26 October 2014,9/10,"As I write these reviews each week I begin by opening the Microsoft Word app on my computer. I create a new document and select the font and size I prefer. Before I start writing I unnecessarily hit bold and type out my name, the film I'm reviewing, and the title of this column: ""Boy Meets Film."" When I came to this ritualistic point of my weekly writing, I stopped. I don't know why I chose the title I did for this column, I suppose I thought it was catchy. But right now, I see it as slightly providential. This is not a typical film, everyone can agree to that fact. When someone is asked what this movie is about they will every time answer by telling how this film was made. In 2002, Richard Linklater had an idea. His idea was to take the same couple actors, same crew, and same vision and over the next twelve years film in real time the childhood and young adult years of a boy named Mason. When the movie begins Mason is six and staring at the clouds thinking about whatever it is six-year-olds think about. When the movie ends Mason has just begun his first day of college. He's lived through his learning years with all the crazy ups, downs, insides, and outs that all of us have had the privilege and burden to bear. And thanks to Richard Linklater's insane idea, we get to live through them again.I could talk all day about how great an idea this is and what commitment it must have taken from everyone involved, because it really is outstanding. But we all realize that, so I won't linger too long. The actors performances, save for Patricia Arquette's (Mason's Mom) incredible breakthrough, were good, but mostly because they could just be themselves. I don't know if Ellar Coltrane (Mason) or Lorelai Linklater (Mason's sister Samantha) have any special acting talent, all they had to do was see themselves in that situation and respond as they would. What was amazing about what they did here didn't come from their acting, it came from their vulnerability. I feel like I know exactly who Ellar Coltrane is as a person because he nakedly put himself in front of the world free to be judged. I don't know if he has an acting career to follow, but he did let me know exactly what kind of person he is and has become.That's the part of the movie that scared me. As I watched this film and as I watched Mason grow into the independent adult that he became, I got chills because I felt like I was watching myself. None of the physical circumstances related: Mason's parents are divorced from the start of the movie - my parents are running on thirty years, Mason got involved in teen drinking and partying – I don't think I even know what beer tastes like. But what I did find was that deep down inside Mason was a hard thinker; he thinks deeper than he needs to or even probably should. As a result, he had questions. I had to keep myself from screaming in the theater because I have found myself asking those same questions day upon day upon day. The ones that we can ask repeatedly, but will always remain unanswered. These questions about life. The same ones I whined about it my review last week. The way people work, the relationships we have with them, the wishy-washiness of life: all of these came echoing back to me as I watched Mason go through the part of life I am at right now.I think what makes this film so good is that I'm not the only one that feels this way. I encourage everyone to look up Drew McWeeneys review of ""Boyhood"" on HitFix.com because after watching this movie because he along with hundreds of others, had the exact same relationship with the film as I did, though in the way that most relates to the kind of person he or she is. I think that's what Linklater achieved with the most profoundness in this film. He set out to portray life and he did. Yes it's a feat, but it has been done before. What he accomplished in the most remarkable way is that he portrayed everyone's life. We come away from this film with Mason as such a firm character in our minds, yet Linklater used the one fictional human being to create a universe full of lives that each and every one of us can relate to in our own very personal way. I apologize for using this column as a personal journal these past two weeks, but these two films are ones that cause you to think about who you are and why you do what you do. That isn't for every movie, but when it does come along it is beautiful. I give ""Boyhood"" a 9.0/10"
BOYHOOD,2 May 2015,4/10,"Can't warm up to this movie. Yes, the idea is compelling, but watching kids grow up real time also happens in the Harry Potter series, so what's the big deal. My problem with this movie is, what's the story apart from watching a boy grow up in a lower-middle class US family, which in it self is not a very appealing topic, at least when you're not American. Being European my childhood was so decidedly different that the appeal of watching this boy grow up is very low, because there is no dwelling in own memories while watching. Though I can see the appeal for US viewers.Apart from that the acting is not really top notch, especially the teens seem insecure and self-aware in front of the camera. Ethan Hawk is great though as a dad who first has to grow up himself. So sorry for every fan of this movie, but I think at 8.1 it is highly overrated."
BOYHOOD,15 November 2018,10/10,"I will show this film to my future children, grandchildren, etc and tell them before starting the movie, ""this is culturally 99% accurate and realistic and authentic to my childhood.""Extraordinary. Truly a landmark piece of storytelling. Though it does not conform to typical, mainstream plot devices, that's exactly what makes it so monumentally valuable beyond the dollar value. It conforms to realism, honesty, and emotional truth."
BOYHOOD,14 March 2015,8/10,"Which way do you want to look? Factual? Sure, let's stick to that. Boyhood—13 years of filming made Richard Linklater an apparent and obvious winner of '15 Oscars although DGAs preferred Alejandro (quite rightly). DGAs retained their legacy on 22nd February when Alejandro outdid Linklater for Birdman.With the exception of Boyhood's direction, nothing in the movie is slightly appreciable, maybe cast's far-stretched loyalty and expectations, but that doesn't amount to anything. Even direction was pretty straight-forward if you look at it.Boyhood is enjoyable only to a certain extent, and after that, you start rubbing your eyes, shaking all ""sleep"" away, and partly, trying to comprehend if the boy's really growing or is it the booze (that can be taken as a complement). There's nothing to praise the movie for except Patricia Arquette, Richard Linklater, and Lorelai Linklater (Oops I did it again!). It's likable at first, but at the end of everything, you start to question yourself—is it the movie, or is it the filmmaker's abnormal effort? We all know that Linklater is famous for his ""Before"" trilogy, and consequently, for his inclination to stick with his projects for long period of times (Before Trilogy was completed in 27 years, each sequel filmed and released 9 years after the prequel, something isn't it?). And I am still grateful to his idiosyncratic and unconventional product, but frankly, the movie doesn't have a good plot. It's uncommon, no doubt, but not good. But then the question is, why didn't The Tree of Life take the Oscar back in 2012 when The Artist (quite comparable to The Grand Budapest Hotel) won the title? The mere fact that Linklater spent over twelve years in making the project is not the forerunner of brilliance, rather of devotion. If you look at it, Boyhood was fragmented, with no legitimate discourse following through. Everything was just happening with time, with no ""drama"" involved. While this was considered as a baffling directorial endeavor, it didn't really have anything to do with direction, rather just sticking with the script, not losing interest, and picking up cameras at every other birthday of Ellar Coltrane.Boyhood, I reckon, wanted to tell a normal story, that didn't have twists and round-about(s) like conventional movies. It presumed that its conventional story-telling would be deemed eccentric and praised for its realism. I have to say that it got that successfully. But was this conversational narrative better at improvisation than all other nominees? Sadly no. Boyhood failed to have a long-lasting impact—ever-occurring goose-bumps. Intense dramas like The King's Speech, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Reader, Chicago, Life of Pi, 12 Years a Slave, and idiosyncratic comedies like The Wolf of Wall Street and The Grand Budapest Hotel were able to communicate their point; there were morals of their respective stories. With Boyhood, this wasn't the case. I couldn't figure out what Linklater was trying to do. He was exceptionally well with his realism in the Before trilogy, but here, it all seemed meaningless. I sure had nostalgia, and craving to experience my childhood again, but it was everything that all of us already long for; it isn't a new dimension that was brought open to us. The impact that winners like Forrest Gump, The English Patient and 12 Years a Slave had on me could never have happened if Boyhood would have won. Birdman, however, has left me puzzled over its bizarre finish, in a good way, of course. I'm so pleased that despite every predictor's incessant attempts at indeliberately modifying my predilection, I was firm. Look what my sound judgment has bestowed me.As for editing, well it sure went through a lot of it, given the time span it covered; Linklater had to see which segments made the story more legit, unbroken, and sensible. But that's what everybody does. Linklater had to spend more time on it because of the far-stretched circumference he had bound himself to.In the end, well yeah I watched it, reviewed it; let's just move on already."
BOYHOOD,20 March 2021,7/10,"O filme é bom, mas ganhou o Óscar porque é um filme de ideologia esquerdista que foi feito para apoiar o partido democrata americano.
A dicção de alguns atores ruim, dificultando o entendimento do Inglês. The film is good, but it won the Oscar because it is a film of leftist ideology that was made to support the American Democratic party.
The diction of some actors is bad, making it difficult to understand English."
BOYHOOD,8 December 2014,5/10,"I really wanted to like this one even though I had read bits of criticism of the film's lack of establishing anything close to what we as film-goers would describe as standard-agreed- upon-narrative cohesion. Fair enough. There's plenty of movies out there that don't play nice with the rules, if you will, and yet find a way to remain fresh and entertaining. Boyhood, however, isn't one of them unfortunately.Linklater is a talented visionary. No doubt. And tackling this project was bound to be a massive complicated mess...I mean over 12 years, what if one of the main characters died? But as others have pointed out, there's no there there. About half way thru I found myself checking the time - dang, how long is this movie? Interestingly as the boy grows older, his acting skills deteriorate. At one point later in the movie during the ""campout"" scene, I would reckon that he's about the best actor in the shot, but if you've seen this, you'll know that's not saying much!Boyhood is an interesting cinematic experiment but I can't imagine watching this ever again and I can't really recommend it to anyone. It's not that it's necessarily a ""bad"" film, it just sorta strands the viewer in the middle of an somewhat uncomfortably meandering ""plot"" that will never live up to the hype of the technical achievement that was utilized to pull it off."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,3/10,"I struggle to find anything good to say about this movie. Maybe if you're really into the process of movie making and find the idea of filming it over a period of 12 years to be exciting, you'd get your rocks off on it. Sure, it was a bold step to take because who knows if all your actors will still be willing to participate in 12 years, or even be alive! But as a movie watcher who loved Foxcatcher, Grand Budapest Hotel, Lego Movie, Moulin Rouge, Schindler's List and Blade Runner (to give an idea of my eclectic tastes), I was pretty much totally bored by this exercise in indulgence. It might have helped if more than two of the cast were capable actors. As it was, the combination of lack of story and really ANYTHING happening, made this an exercise in endurance for me, the watcher. I found myself constantly checking to see how much of the 2 hours and 45 minutes was remaining, and fast forwarding a few segments because I had better places to be. The best scene in the whole movie, for me, was the contraception discussion and for that, I elevated it from one star to three. I sure hope this does NOT win Best Picture at the Oscars because that would be a big insult to ALL the other contenders."
BOYHOOD,22 July 2014,9/10,"The story follows a boy's childhood, from age 6 to 18. I find it interesting and somewhat admirable to film this over 12 years. The narrative is straightforward and the story is very down-to-earth and real. The main themes are family, love, bonding, difficulties, finding direction in life, knowing who you are or could be. With a running time of nearly three hours, ""Boyhood"" didn't feel a minute too long. The acting is okay, Hawke and Arquette at their best, and the children did a good, believable job as well. It will certainly not appeal to everyone, but I really liked the humble simplicity of it."
BOYHOOD,7 August 2015,10/10,"Boyhood is excellence in realism, the film's Scope, narrative and acting is top-notch, this is a show-stopper for both the film-industry and as well as myself, there is no other drama film like it, here's why.The film follows a Mason, a boy from the age of 6 to the age of 18, through a 12-year cycle, every year they experience fun, serious business and Family issues, With each year, his Family changes and having a different Apartment each time, the ending is great With him getting to college, making friends and that's basically it.The film's direction is stunning, filmed in 12 years, wow, i cannot believe it. Each scene sparkles With glee and depression. The acting is a outstanding achievement, Patricia Arquette is fantastic as well as Ethan Hawke. The Scope is brilliant, each sprawling setting goes through a lot to the plot.The narrative is the highlight of this Movie, having a nearly 3 hour Movie With so much Depth and character Development, that it's a miracle from beginning to end.Boyhood is the best film from 2014 and a outstanding achievement in film history, acting, characters, Scope, narrative and it's realism and length makes it a Perfect Movie for both Movie fans and drama fans.10/10"
BOYHOOD,25 October 2019,2/10,I went to see this because it has 1000 on Metacritic so I was excited.I stopped watching after the 5th existential angst monologue.
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,10/10,"Richard Liklater is known for his simple yet full of life movies, it's always about a group of friends or a couple or in this case an individual and he always succeeds because he somehow manages to drag into the film mostly with his realistic look at life it's just like magic you actually travel into the movie and you live the moment with the characters in the movie, you actually hang out with them smile for their jokes and cry for their losses. actually in Liklater's movies Dazed and Confused, the Before Trilogy, waking life and now this there's always that déja vu moment, because the characters experience the same stuff that i as a viewer experienced when i was in their position whether it's the last day in school or the girl i met once in a train or things i used to do as a teenager. and let's not forget his philosophical touch which adds more depth to the movie, speaking of depth i think Boyhood is one of the deepest movies i have ever seen, it follows this kid as he grows up to become an adult in such a unique way never depicted on film since the dawn of filmmaking , we don't need to go through the process of explaining the making of this movie because i'm sure that everyone that visits this page is aware of it. but is this movie just about this kid growing up? no it is not. it is actually a close look at society in that period of time (the 90s in this case) through the eyes of a very normal kid, who is by the way someone that you might even never knew if he was in the same school with you, he is not cool and sexy and stuff but he is however not dumb as most of the kids born in this generation (no offense). one of the reasons this movie is brilliant is how realistic it is, being born in the 90s i shared a lot of the stuff this kid goes through in this movie and yes Linklater got it right from high-school to video games to music to cinema and even politics. I read in this movie's message boards that some people didn't like the movie because of the main character as he is just not that interesting and he didn't really have a sense of humor and that kind of crap but as i said above this is the story of a very normal boy and i believe not everyone was a Ferris Bueller when he was young but somehow it matters for some people if the main character is cool or not heck they judge the movie based on that but does it really matters, why can't you guys just take it for what it is this is a story of a specific kid let's assume Richard Linklater chose a boy randomly and unfortunately he picked up Mason, so really get over it if you really think that of this movie do the world a favor don't ever tell anyone on IMDb your opinion about movies anymore. in fact one of the things i liked about the movie is Mason Jr, he had a unique point of view about everything and he was an artist, and as he grows up we see him making is own unique personality by learning from his past mistakes and standing up for what he believes in. another point i wanted to make before i finish my review is the cinematography, i mean when the events are taking place in the 90s the movie looked from the 90s the colors the camera angles the lightening in fact it reminded me of his movie TAPE but by the time we reach the 2000s it simply changes and it's now a movie from that period of time, it gave this movie a sense of time because apart from Mason's aging the movie doesn't really give you a heads up to weather we are advancing in time. Finally, this is a well executed movie full of nostalgia, it drags you inside like other Linklater movies only this time is very special, the directing is brilliant the acting is top notch and the dialog is very real, so if you haven't seen it what are you waiting for?"
BOYHOOD,8 July 2019,8/10,"A staggering and successful attempt at capturing the early years of boys. A movie spanning over 12 years in the production will always be something special, and there is no question that Richard Linklater has made a groundbreaking film in this genre.Boyhood follows the boy Mason from his early kindergarten days to his first steps into adulthood. Throughout the years we follow Mason, his mother goes through several breakups and divorces. Something that is bound to have an effect on children. Mason's biological father, whom Mason's mother had departed with before the movie's start, comes to visit every other weekend and takes Mason and his sister Samantha out on different events. From the beginning it is obvious that Mason's father has some clear parenting issues and one might perhaps understand why Mason's mother left him. At the same time Mason's new stepdads seem much nicer at first. Though all this change later when they all turn out to be drunken control freaks.It truly makes a great point about our life and society, when towards the ending of the movie, Mason's mother and father's lives have taken very different turns. His father, learning from the mistake he did with Mason's mother, develops through bonding with his children a sense of parenting and manages to gain some control over his life, while also finding a partner to stick with. Mason's mother on the other hand, keeps trying to find a good man, and all of them turns out to be horrendous. Towards the end his mother is exhausted, feeling that her life has been a complete waste of time. This greatly illustrates the harsh environment women sometimes find themselves in and how men more often than not can be idiots. Mason's father can simply learn from his mistakes and start again with another woman, while Mason's mother has to go through it all again with another man.All of this is deeply and profoundly made with a lot of thought. Though where the movie falls short for me is the story of our main character. As any young human being, Mason goes through various stages of his life. Having long hair, being emo, painted nails and earrings. Something that all parents must be above all things is supportive. None of Mason's stepfathers were that. Having his hair shaven off at the barber and complaining about his earrings and painted nails. Though we see later how this will shape older Mason, I feel the movie fails at showing his momentary emotions. Not once throughout the film do we see Mason actually cry, and I do not for a second believe a person goes through their teens without shedding a tear. It feels like a missed opportunity. While the movie is exceptionally well made, it feels like it focuses more on the events circulating Mason rather than the effects it has on him. I would not have minded this film being 4 hours long, as it was joyful to watch all the way through, just so we could have been showed more sides of Mason.On the technical aspects of the movie, it excels even further. The acting is truly remarkable, with the best performance coming from Ellar Coltrane (Mason), that I believe was Oscar worthy. Furthermore, Linklater knows how to get what he wants from the actors in every scene. Because they all seem supernaturally realistic, without being dull. On this aspect the script and dialog must be noted as well. While not being the most eventful like a Tarantino or Coen movie, this movie's dialog is so brilliant just for the fact that it is not. It absolutely nails conversations between teenagers, as well as adults and between adults and teenagers as well. Needles to say, the cinematography, production design and the rest is spot on, and the movie also needs to be hailed for it's unprecedented achievement in having the same actors do the same movie for 12 years. Have that in any movie and its bound to be good. The only part I feel the movie dissatisfies in, in the technical aspect, was that the scenes often felt too short, like there was no time to grasp the events that just unfolded. Finishing the movie it is hard to pick a ""favourite scene"" as there barely were any long enough to consider.Conclusively, this movie is nothing short of brilliant. Though in some ways a let down, not because of what it was, but because of what it could have been. It truly could have been the perfect movie."
BOYHOOD,23 October 2019,5/10,I like the experience. Its very different. But i dont like the story or anyother part of this movie. Starting was good and after few minutes it lost its beauty.
BOYHOOD,18 February 2015,6/10,"I do give credit to Linklater for this project and breaking cinematic ground with using the same cast and filming over such a long time period. I just wonder what reviews this film would have got if the cast wasn't the same all the way through. Because, to my mind, there isn't too much else behind this gimmicky facade besides an average movie.The plot is literally a boy growing from the ages of 5-18. And that's it. There's a bit of marriage break-up and domestic violence in there (both of which are portrayed very well by Patricia Arquette) but otherwise you're going to see nigh on 3 hours of a kid going to school, going bowling and going to college. That said, I wasn't particularly bored by the film. I just wonder what all the fuss is about.I just don't see how this film gives much to the run of the mill movie-goer. The raving seems to be that the film is relatable and celebrates the normality and banality of family living situations. I just don't get it though. I'm 28 years of age so have experienced the live show of family quarreling and parents break up. Mrs Doubtfire was a more poignant depiction of family break up for my money.I actually think this film has exactly the same problem as Birdman. This film was created for Awards panels and the Academy and not for the person who works all week and pays their $15 to go and enjoy a movie on a Friday night.If you can enjoy the film and can enjoy it for a feat of cinema, then good luck to you. I didn't hate the film and I wasn't bored to death. I just think there's a bit too much attention being paid to the thin veneer of the fact that it's done with the same cast, and not enough attention being paid to the chasm of nothingness beneath."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2021,9/10,"I still can't believe this movie is real. richard linklater made a film that took 13 years of shooting as you know it even further after the before sunrise trilogy. He met with the characters every year, and at the end, a very cute movie came out in which he describes how a child grows from the age of 5 to the age of 18 in very fine details and his unique funny language. Watching the character change every year and the fact that everything is very real makes the movie fascinating. When the director decided to shoot this film, he did not know that the before sunrise series would continue, and after seeing that he could shoot this movie, he decided to shoot Before Sunset.The director has spoken about his childhood a lot while writing the film. Since he has lived in Houston since he was born, he presented how a child will grow up in Texas under such conditions that the 163-minute film can be watched almost without getting bored. The shooting of this production as a masterpiece for american indie cinema without any help or sponsorship of Hollywood makes it even more special. I can say a nirvana point for cinema lovers. Meanwhile, it will determine the continuation of the film, the manhood, according to the audience reaction of the film."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,8/10,"While I am excited that Richard Linklater is finally getting the recognition that is quite overdue, the awards for ""Boyhood"" also inevitably trigger a flurry of polarized reviews, giving it either a ""10"" or a ""1"", with hyperbole in either direction. Unfortunately it is a movie that requires reflection over some days, so gut reactions based on awards competitiveness are out of place. You, as the reader, are browsing through multiple reviews of ""Boyhood"", so I will try to raise some slightly different observations: -As for style, narrative, and pacing, ""Boyhood"" falls more in line with Linklater's 'wandering slacker movies': ""Slacker"", ""Dazed and Confused"", ""Waking Life"", and the ""Before..."" trilogy. It is a series of episodes, some with colorful Texans, others with philosophical conversations, and others simply capturing the moment.-It is a very Texan movie. Who needs more shots of New York and Los Angeles? Aside from the Texan pace and character (which may annoy people from the Northeast), Linklater spends his time in the Houston-Austin/San Marcos corridor, capturing life as urban Texans experience it: no cowboys, no deserts, no rodeos. We do get red-and-cream college campuses with water fountains, wide avenues, hip bars and diners, parties with eccentrics, green grass, buildings that are no more than 100 years old, your average suburbs, and the occasional foray into the beautiful parks of South Central Texas. And yes, when out of the cities, there's brief interludes into guns and bibles.-It is a powerful experience as a time capsule. With the lack of narrative suspense (other than the outcome of the experiences with the step-fathers), the biggest driving force of interest is to see what the actors will look like next. At times it is natural, at other times shocking, like the protagonist's sudden awkward change into a 15-year old (as happens to all boys), and the vastly changing looks of Patricia Arquette. But in addition we get the 00s decade on film, as it happened. This is unusual as all movies that examine a previous decade depend on recreation, using the worst fashions, stereotypes, and highlights as determined by pop culture writers. Here, it is naturally captured as it is experienced by average Americans: internet children, 9/11, George W. Bush, Harry Potter, the unstable economy of the early decade, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the housing crisis, Barack Obama, and iPhones. It is accompanied by an alt rock soundtrack that uses music of the moment, rather than historically mismatched assorted hits. Finally, it is revealing as few have bothered to examine that last decade, feeling it empty and uninteresting.-We do not only see the protagonist grow up, but we also see the parents grow up. They both struggle with taking the leaps towards responsible parenting and establishing a family home, while trying to develop themselves. The impact of parenthood on identity is played out, quite well.-In the collection of experiences, there will be some that different people can identify with, and others that they do not. At times you might find yourself agreeing more with the parents or step-parents. teenage version of Mason is hard to root for, but this is natural: most teenage boys are not the jocks and nerds depicted in pop culture; they are awkward, annoying, have self-esteem issues, alternating between mumbling and bravado, make poor choices, and focus on a few key details of their appearance while ignoring basic hygiene of others. It is hard for adult to relate to them, or even like them, and vice-versa.All that being said, is it interesting? Most of the time, yes. There are a few scenes that could have been cut out, and time periods that could have been whittled down; they drag on too long and do not contribute much, particularly in the last hour.I should clarify that this is not a ""nothing happens"" movie. I detest the pretentious film theories that a good movie is ""where nothing happens"" and ""it captures life as it is"". Most of these film theorists do not live 'real' lives or work tough average jobs (nor, quite frankly, leave the seat of their couch that much), so perhaps they need this. But for me, most of these movies are terrible, featuring very uninteresting characters and conversations, and I would rather walk outside or interact with my friends than watch them. I prefer my cinema to be in the tradition of the Lumiere's ""Arrival of a Train"": show me what I cannot see for myself, or show me the ordinary in a spectacular way. I like my escapism and my stylized direction. I will take a Marvel Studios movie any day over another silly Lars Von Trier movie or dull Eric Rohmer movie. I laugh at the trailers for the 21st century Godard flicks.All that said, I did find that ""Boyhood"" has some engaging narrative, but in episodic pieces. ""Stuff"" does happen. Most of it is driven by the experiences of Arquette's character, with the protagonist as the perennial passenger in the back seat of her story. There are some points in which not much happens, and it is more a 'slice of life' experience. These are a mixed bag: some offer the highlights that I raised in the previous points, but others are too unfocused and uninteresting. Some of the spaces in the narrative are rescued by Ethan Hawke's father character, who is usually entertaining. A week after seeing it, I am still digesting it all, trying to evaluate how I felt about it overall, similar to my reaction to ""The Tree of Life"".Last thing to note: I've never been the biggest fan of Patricia Arquette's character, but she impressed me here, particularly with her ""I got tired of having my head smashed into a wall"" scene."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,,"Its nice to see that movies can still be critically acclaimed by the media and still be enjoyed by the general public. Boyhood is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It had to believe that a project like this could be pulled off over 12 years. Ellar Coltrane was great throughout this movie. It would be neat if this movie is the only thing he does. He really shows what its like to be a growing male. I found many aspects of his life that we similar to events in my own life. The one problem I find with his character, Mason is that he gets a little too smart for me later on in the film and I really don't need to hear any in depth conversations about the meaning of life and such. Young people don't really think like that anymore, or at least not mass quantities of them. Ethan Hawke was great also as the father. I'm going to say that this is the best thing he's ever done. Ethan Hawke is a bad that you wish everyone had. Richard Linklater has pulled off a movie that has captured a point in time and although it may not be relevant forever it will be one of the most significant movies of this period of time. Linklater even did so while casting his own daughter with little experience in one of the lead roles. I would be 100% happy with Boyhood winning best picture this year and I wouldn't be shocked if it does."
BOYHOOD,2 December 2016,5/10,I will start off with the positives why I gave this movie any rating at all. To start off I enjoy and respect the project. I enjoy the attempt to create a unique movie with a unique style of taking years to film the development of one actor instead of using multiple. I also thought while the majority of the movie was boring and uneventful I thought their were some glimmers of hope. I also admit I like Ethan hawke and thought he did well so they deserve credit for that as well as the mother she did a good job too. Now the negatives. To kick off how mainly uneventful this movie was. Not much really happened I mean you had the stretch with her second husband the professor I liked that whole part but overall it seemed like they were filming pretty normal everyday activities and gives the viewer little reason to stick around. Another negative was how negative this movie was in general. The boy turned out to be some negative like hipster emo person who has a shitty view on the world and life in general. The kid is dull and does very little real acting. They try to show that he is like a hidden smart kid who doesn't talk but all I see is some uninteresting annoying negative person and I disliked that about the character progression. Especially when the father seemed to have influence on the son and the father was a really upbeat passionate person you would think that's what the kid would develop in to. The movie also failed to explain some parts like the whole husband that was the military guy. It seemed like everything was going great and then the kid and him got in one fight and w never saw the guy again like what happened with that. Overall the movie was a long boring journey of this kid who has a bunch of bad things happen to him and then just doesn't really say or do much throughout the film.
BOYHOOD,10 May 2020,8/10,"When i saw the movie length i discouraged a bit, but actually despite nothing particularly extraordinary happens, the movie flew along easily.
Maybe because it's a film about a part of life i've already lived, maybe because it's extraordinarily simple in the best meaning of the word.It's a very natural movie and natural it's the way it' acted, brilliantly.Moving in some parts, very well shot, beautiful photography, a very brilliant and true film about life."
BOYHOOD,4 January 2015,4/10,"Linklater has created a movie project on the premise of filming over 10+ years, where viewers are supposed to see characters transform themselves into something else. Unfortunately the result never happens. The character development is basically non-existent. The only real change we see in the movie is with Ethan Hawke's character: He changes from trying to win the Mom back at the beginning to finally moving on and finding someone else and finally being happy with himself. But what about the other characters? The first scene we see in the movie is Mason staring up into the sky, wondering about himself or his life. The final scene in the movie is Mason staring out on the hike with the girl, wondering about himself or his life. Throughout the movie Mason struggles to establish himself and a purpose or even enjoyment in life. There was no transformation, no development. And what of the mother? She started as a recently divorced single mother and ends as a recently divorced single mother. She remarried, all to guys that could never satisfy, let her down, or were abusive. There was no transformation of her character over the entire movie, either. So what of the actual movie? Well, Coltrane's acting was something I'd expect to see on a CW network TV series show. And Ethan Hawke's character never had the time or writing to really exercise his full potential. The cinematography and editing were all average, almost budgeted. Screenplay? If I had read the screenplay without seeing the movie, there's no way I would be urged to see the movie. It felt tired and strained, like it had been done before: Showing merely snippets of everyday life. Unfortunately the acting and character relationships aren't strong enough to support this attempt. By the end of the movie, some viewers feel tired and cheated. The film's more intimate scenes all felt as artificial as the idea of an aging cast. There was no magical transformation or deep-hearted, moving piece of life. There was just typical life. So why the hype? Well, that's easy. There's only one logical answer: Relatability. Some viewers found immense relatability and recalled their own childhood. Unfortunately this by-product of the film doesn't mean we should overlook all other merits and praise it; otherwise one would be no better than cult movies where loyal followers automatically praise regardless of substance."
BOYHOOD,21 April 2015,7/10,"Boyhood follows Mason Jr from the age of 6 to 18 with 12 years of filming in between showing the struggles of coming from a broken family with a variety of characters and the implications that has on his character and outlook on life.At first I thought this film was quite good and originally gave it an 8/10 but after discussing it with a friend I soon realised there was a lot they could of done much much better. What I did like tho was the the acting, soundtrack and the idea of filming it across 12 years. The acting was very good from most of the cast there was no standout actor or actress who was was poorer than anyone but people like Ethan Hawke (Mason Sr/Dad) who for me stole the show in every scene he was in, he brought a sense of ease and experience to the screen you didn't get from for lesser known actors. Marco Perella for example who gave who gave an incredibly good performance, left you shocked and disgusted. Both Ellar Coltrane (Mason Jr) & Lorelei Linklater (Samantha) were great, Lorelei especially when she was younger playing the annoying sister did a really really good job. The soundtrack was brilliant it dipped a little at the start of the final third of the film but I still went to go listen to it after seeing the movie which I rarely do, (I spent all the next day listening to it and am listening to it now while writing this review) it was filled with songs I grew up knowing and hating. A young Lorelei Linklater imitating and singing famous songs from Britney Spears and High School Musical stick in my mind and remind me of when I was younger. The idea of a movie getting filmed across 12 years and watch the cast grow is a very good one and completely original. Sadly tho they missed opportunities that only comes from making a film across a 12 year span and I'm gutted, it could of been done so much better. The first and one of my biggest annoyances was the cuts when they wanted to move forward a few months/years it was done with one quick cut that seemed rather unexpected, just when you thought a big fight was gonna happen or something dramatic was gonna be witnessed they just skip over it, next scene the problems gone and something else has taken its place. I think a smarter way of doing it is cutting it into a few main scenes and played music over the top so we would see the main things happen (Fights/crying/leaving) without stretching the film too much. Or even after they filmed it across 12 years they could of just done a time lapse of the events that followed. Just a couple of suggestions I thought of that would of been better than the cuts they did do. This also ruined the actual story of the film in the fact there isn't really one even the Plot Summary on IMDb is vague and just filled with complements to the actors. The quick cuts would fast forward a few years and soon you realise he suddenly has this, to me, quite odd outlook on life and he then in every scene talks about different conspiracy theories about computers and human life which would of been really cool and interesting if we actually saw his progression to become like that which I don't think they did, not enough at least. They tried to show big parts of a young boys life in a few scenes of him and friend looking through a lingerie catalogue and looking at online porn but they didn't even touch on anything else like what is said behind closed doors when they are annoyed after a fight with there parents and all puberty stuff got missed too. I was surprised due to the lack of anything actually happening story wise I thought they would of added more big moments in a young guys life but they didn't I can't understand why. Overall it was an alright movie with an original way of story telling (filmed over 12 years) mixed with a solid soundtrack and very good acting sadly it missed a lot of elements that could of made it great. 7/10."
BOYHOOD,31 July 2021,3/10,"I wanted to like Boyhood, a highly experimental film watching the childhood of a boy. After all, this film is a technical masterpiece, one that was filmed for twelve years and was made with love and care. The shots and film quality improves each year in the movie's timeline and it's fascinating to see. While I think the acting in this is largely passable, the parents are easily the best characters, people who went their separate ways and continue those ways.But I also hate this movie. I think Boyhood suffers from a pretentious and shallow script, stereotypical and flat characters, slow pacing, and the aimless plot renders the story boring. And to top it all off with a lead character, who is very uninteresting and expressionless; he rarely emotes and his acting gets worse over the years. And I heavily disagree with the message of the movie: that life is about nothing. To which I find utterly baffling and contradicted by the film's own events.But with all this being said, I do understand why someone would love this movie and the elements I just bashed. It all comes down to perception and taste. But I personally feel that a film about childhood has been done more in-depth and more maturely in different movies like Lady Bird and Seventeen. Other people like (even love) this movie, yet that's alright."
BOYHOOD,13 November 2019,6/10,Interesting story but the movie is pretty forgettable since it doesn't have a very strong impact on someone's mind. Would never watch again.
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,7/10,"The world of cinema is mostly about lying to the audience. That's what George Melies based most of his films: on the magic tricks that were possible because of the medium. To this day, there are very few films that don't use special effects or even makeup. But this movie does away with aging special effects because the aging is real. The director chose to film every year with the same actors and explore the life of a boy as he grows up and becomes a man. This film's power comes from this honesty that would not have been possible by filming it in a normal way. One can notice subtle details about life that changed as we watch this movie. The story itself is good with the normal tropes of growing up but it does feel disjointed as we don't see everything these characters go through (the totality of their life). Some interesting characters just disappear from the film and life of the characters without many mentions later in an unrealistic way which is disappointing from a movie that prides itself on realism. The dialog and acting is realistic and phenomenal. This film is impressive and unique for what it set out to do: film every year for 12 years."
BOYHOOD,16 December 2014,,"Boyhood is a great film, it feels incredibly natural, you just don't think of this as a movie, but as an ordinary experience that can be seen in the real world, this happens, it feels like you're in the story, which is also accomplished due to the dialogue being so genuine. The acting is perfect, like I said before it feels incredibly natural, you don't even see the people as actors, but as real people, I thought the best parts of the movie were when Mason was young, it didn't even seem as if he was acting! God so damn natural. Coltrane gave an amazing performance, so did the rest of the cast, with special props to Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke who were incredible. The directing is amazing, how Linklater didn't change during the 12 years of film is really awesome, he was able to keep the calm tone of the movie for the whole time. The only cons I saw were that as Mason grew up he kept spouting nonsense, he became really philosophical and stuff, I get that he didn't know what to do with his life, and people go through those phases but still, great performance though, obviously. Also, the film gradually became slower and slower, and I know it's interesting to see, the kid growing up, but sadly it just got less and less interesting to me. It's also not fun, like at all, you feel good watching it, but it's just dead.Boyhood is one of a kind, in and out of the screen. I give it an 8.6/10."
BOYHOOD,28 December 2014,2/10,"Seriously, 100/100? For this 3 hours of ""nothing at all happens"" as several other reviews put it?I just gave it an extra star because acting and casting is good really. But that in no way compensates for the fact it is a film that is like common real life: goes from nothing to nothing, most of it is filled with morons, boredom and nothing else.We don't need movies to look at that, we have it every day, quite unavoidably anyway. So just ignore the hype and save your time for better things, if movie, then you can find ones that at least have an attempt at having a plot -- really even one with holes has more entertaining value."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,10/10,"I have waited a few days before writing this review just so all the thoughts provoked by it could be written properly. So here goes nothing.Movies have found ways to bring a lot of people together for a lot of different reasons. Whether it was to escape from real life or to keep real life from escaping us. There has always been something more or less magical about the work people present to the movie going public. Then there is Boyhood.This 12 year experiment from the same guy who made Jack Black into a lead actor, does a fair amount of things to make this arguably the best piece of cinema ever made. Yes, above Pulp Fiction, above Shawshank Redemption and even (shoot me down here if you want) above The Godfather. There is the obvious nostalgia that comes in as a person in theory not far away from the relation of Mason, the boy we see grow up before our very eyes. There are the emotions that aren't necessarily overacted and to Linklater's credit, chose not to and it works. He chooses to show the moments we all have lived with. The talk with Dad, the talk with Mom, the actions of siblings, the things we don't really think about unless we really reflect on what we have done in the past.The acting isn't real crazy either with the exception of Marco Perella who plays an excellent a-hole stepfather. Patricia Arquette does her job and does it well along with Ethan Hawke but depending on your opinions, may not like these characters due to their actions. The true heart of the acting comes from Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater who you see grow not only as actors on a screen but as human beings and as a younger person, it hit home harder than a Mayweather punch. What makes it all hit home will depend on the viewer. If you're a child of divorce, it'll hit home. If you're a child who did the normal rebellious things you did as a child and teenager, it'll hit home. Yet it's not just the big things (relationships and such), it's the little moments that make this movie truly special and in comes what makes it above the rest.Movies have always had an emphasis on the big moments. Whether it's the big climatic change, the acting that wins Oscars, big explosions etc. Boyhood finds a way to make cinema so close to real life that there is no need for the big moments. Much like life, it flew before your eyes, the years merged and if you're not careful will hit you with an emotional roller coaster that not even Toy Story 3 could match (though it is close). Now comes the narcissistic part of this review.For almost 6 years, I have been looking for the ""perfect film."" The film that gives real life it's just deserts and doesn't try to do anything more than just tell a great story. Aside from the pop culture references in this movie, I can honestly relate to about maybe half of the 12 years shown. Immediately after watching it I reflected about what I missed in life because I was afraid to take chances, refusing to live for the moment. What made it worse was that as a person who was raised by two of the nicest people on Earth, I didn't appreciate what I had, ever. What made the feeling worse was that I needed a movie to tell me what I should have known all along. If a movie can create this much inner though along with enjoying the small things in life. It's done it's job and then some. Linklater definitely did and unless someone does another 12 year project, it'll never be matched again."
BOYHOOD,27 July 2014,8/10,"I was nervous going in because I wanted Boyhood to be good. In fact, I wanted it to be spectacular. I've been a fan of Richard Linklater's career since I watched Before Sunrise (a viewing of Before Sunset quickly followed) back in 2010. His ability to capture an experience, a culture, a generation, and a life and translate it into film in such a way that is utterly beguiling, yet doesn't feel manipulated is staggering to watch. News of Boyhood reached me around this time last year, and before I knew much about it, I was hooked. A film from Richard Linklater about a young man growing up around the same time I did? And 12 years of filming were dedicated? It was going to be spectacular. So much for nothing in life being certain.Allow me, if you will, to avoid the part where I colorfully unpeel Boyhood's dynamics, hinting along the way how well it fairs against everything I've seen. IT. IS. UNBELIEVABLE. The script, the execution, the profoundness, and seamless integration of time are nothing short of astonishing. Subdued in nature as it may be, Boyhood is a vivid, captivating, all-consuming assault on the senses. Not only that, there is a deep seated quality to everything it does. And the viewer is absolutely at the core of the experience. Each element has been created and tuned to allow you to express yourself anyway you wish. And that amazing focus has produced a breathtaking film. From a technical standpoint, it's everything I've come to expect from Linklater, only finished to a higher standard. Boyhood is a film about life. The script has no rising action, climax, or falling action. There is no plot driven by a narrative driven by a goal. Nothing feels manipulated. Linklater's directing is level-headed and controlled, with quick cuts to whoever is talking and a lack of camera motion for a truly first-person omniscient feel. You are observing, but not fully knowing. And the cinematography... was there even a cinematographer? Boyhood's sets look so painfully boring because everything looks so natural, the background fades and allows 100% of your focus to be on the characters. Despite a silent car ride home and very much conducive analysis, my brain is STILL buffering from the mind-blowing quality of it all. I wonder how I will view my words when this high subsides. My final scattered thought is this; The best moments in film are when it comes across something; a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things that you'd thought was special and particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you've never met. And it's as if a hand has come out and taken yours. That is what Richard Linklater has done. Boyhood is a great film. More importantly it's a great film from Richard Linklater. Maybe even the greatest. and his career is here to stay."
BOYHOOD,4 December 2014,7/10,"If I were to be cynical I would say that Boyhood is overlong, bloated, meandering and painted with the broadest of narrative brushes, I'm not going to. It would be pointless for me to not be open to liking any film that peaks my interest. I don't like cynicism for the sake of it or for furthering your own agenda.It's not my cup of tea but I most certainly do admire and respect it. While certainly not chock full of operatic cinematic theatricality I found it to be quite enjoyable at many stages. Given Richard Linklater's sensibilities it would honestly be hard for anything he has done or will do to top Dazed and Confuzed for me personally.Overall, Boyhood is a story told from a purely observational perspective. It's ambitiously unambitious, exceptionally unexceptional but that's precisely the point."
BOYHOOD,12 September 2014,7/10,"Boyhood; a fairly entertaining movie. But it was just one of those movies were you get so connected with the characters and think,""Oh, I don't want this movie to ever the end."" But when then ending comes around, your thinking ""Huh? What? Who's that? What did she say? How did he reply? Damn, I mustn't have been listening hard enough."" That was definitely me after this film. The movie was filmed over 12 years; so we could watch the character's life from five to eighteen years of age. We see the hardships of the boy,As he tries to cope with growing up, seeing his father, watching his mum remarry about three or four times, and his sister. Seriously, you wouldn't remember the details either if you were sitting in the most uncomfortable seat in the movie theatre. As you watch this, it starts to become suspenseful and scary, especially when Ethan Hawke's character grows a mustache (BWAAAH!!!!!!). You get connected to the characters, yet later you may have trouble trying to figure out what's happened off-screen. Usually I do't like movies like this; but this one was an exception. So overall, if like movies like movies like 'Finding Neverland' (2004) then you will definitely like his heart warming twelve year epic (even if the ending really sucks). You definitely won't regret sitting in an uncomfortable chair for three hours either (just joking people, just joking...)."
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,10/10,"I had very high expectations for this movie and they have been met...no exceeded. It's simple really... just the life of a Texan kid called Mason filmed over 12 years- from age 6 til aged 18. That itself is so astonishing yet beautiful to see as time unfolds seeing all the characters age- not just Mason but every single actor is the person. We see the ageing by haircuts, growing taller,growing facial hair, divorces, new babies etc.The best thing about this film is, as you watch them trying to find their place in the world, you just care about them a lot. Even though the characters are actually ageing the events happening are fictional but it never feels that way; it feels so natural and not acted. This makes it so relatable and it especially resonated with me since I am only a year younger than Mason. So I remember old brick-like mobiles and box TVs, Facebook to iphones and how I didn't realise how quickly things were advancing.I'm not even exaggerating when I say I could not stop thinking about it. Literally after I watched it, before I went to bed, when I woke up and even the next day.It kind of made me quite emotional but not in a sad/crying way but in some inexplicable way. I think all ages including parents, kids, teens can identify with it. As it show the struggles of everyone and even made me understand a bit better what my parents go through.I've never seen anything so beautiful, humane and warm. I honestly feel enriched after seeing it and I never say that about films. It is 2 hours 45 mins but I was so transfixed that I didn't even notice and it could have been longer and it would not bore me. Definitely Oscar-worthy or should,at the very least, be nominated."
BOYHOOD,26 July 2015,6/10,"Hey guys it's quinn C from YouTube and today let's review...Boyhood, the 12 years in the making movie that was actually going to be called 12 years until it was realized that everyone would confuse it with 12 years a slave, stars a fictional family as they grow up from tee children's childhoods until college. That's the setup, now lets rantFor those of you who don't know, screen junkies recently did an honest trailer for this video, and the top comment, left by your truly, was that boyhood is the movie that everyone loves, but deep down hates. And really, that is how I would describe this movie. From a critical view, it's definitely an achievement in its own, but there is just so much I don't like about it that it sort of weighs the movie down for me, let me explain.One thing in the honest trailer that was noted, which I think we can all agree on, is that if this movie was only made over the course of a few months to a year at most, it wouldn't be that good of a movie. Now for me, the one thing that I love most, besides action galore, is a really firm story, and boyhood just doesn't have one. Granted, it had a theme about maturing, and I know it's supposed to show how this family and really culture grows, but as a FICTIONAL family, there is no reason that some sort of ark can't be created. Literally the movie is the family fitting in to the times, the mom getting married and then getting divorced, and the step dad just being awesome (at least for me, he was my favorite character by far). Just something to add flavor would have made this film so much more intense and interesting. Like imagine if they had a dog, who dies at like year 7, that would have been engaging as hell and would have provided actual change to this family. Hell I watched time cop the other day and every character changes more than this group does, at least personality wise, which is sad if you think about itSomething that really needs to be addressed though, and the reason that this film should not win best picture, even though this film is indeed very good in a critical sense, is that the real time growing up gimmick has been done before. For those of you who don't know, I believe back in the 60s a series of films known as the 7 up or simply the 'up' films, have done this gimmick but with real people. Every 7 years, they check in on 7 people, real people, and it is witnessed how some have achieved success, and some haven't. And these films, I don't think they do anymore, but these films did come out every 7 years. Granted not 12 years like boyhood, but it's more consistent with real human beingsSo with that in mind, why should boyhood get best picture. In all sincerity, the film I reviewed last time, the gran Budapest hotel, I believe to be a superior film. If you have a weak story, with a gimmick that has already been done, then why should this film win. For acting, whiplash, night crawler, hell gone girl, could be argued to have better acting. For directing, simple, interstellar. And yes I'll discuss that film in Much Much detail next time. So yes, the cast and crew, as well as tee directing, great job, but what makes a movie great is a great story and message. Lets take an obvious one, citizen Kane. An amazing story of a man growing up, when in the end his happiest days were in childhood with his family. Gret message, great story, incredible movie. Boyhood, a film which it's tough to even prove what the message is, seeing as you can just as easily argue that it's about raising a family as the message was to grow up; the story was weak, and it really wasn't an incredible film, seeing as the gimmick has been done before. So overall thoughts. In every way that I understand why people think this film is good, I just see it as trite. And I know, it's remarkable that they kept this group around for 12 years, and seeing this family grow, to be honest, at the time, was really cool. I really did love the parents, and they are truly fantastic in their roles and are super likable. But I've had a few months now to digest this film, and so I'll put it as plainly as I can. Besides the clear, obvious fact that the 12 continues years were filmed flawlessly, what makes this film better than the others made this year. I'll point out the ones people rip on. Expendables 3: lets be honest, way more fun movie. Planet of the apes:more engaging charters, story and arc. Godzilla: it was awesome. And that right there is the problem with boyhood. Besides it's deserved praise, going longer than each individual up film ever did; I have never heard someone watch boyhood and say, that movie was awesome. For that reason, which ultimately is how you should scale how much you TRULY enjoy a movie, I'm sorry guys, with a score of 7.1, this is I believe the second lowest rating I have ever given a filmIf you guys enjoyed this review, be sure to check me out at Quinn C on YouTube. I constantly review movies and James Bond as it comes out, and every new viewer would be much appreciated. Again you can find me at Quinn C on YouTube, the one with the James Bond emblem. Please be sure to check me out and thank you"
BOYHOOD,20 April 2021,8/10,"This movie is quite profound and worth the watch if you're into films that have real meaning, but that's not what my review is about.I see not just a couple, but an overwhelming number of reviews that insult Ellar Coltrane's acting skills. I have to question the intelligence or perhaps sanity of the people who have written these reviews. The character of Mason(Junior) is the most accurate portrayal of a teenager I have ever seen. I really don't know what they expect, have any of you people ever encountered a teenager? Do you not remember being a teenager yourself?Mason Junior is aloof, quirky, thinks himself special compared to others... he reminded me of most of the male classmates I had throughout school. I think people are too used to 'Hollywood' teenage characters, which are not at all in line with reality. Ellar did a fantastic job of playing something 'real'."
BOYHOOD,11 November 2014,7/10,"I only watched this last night so i might need to go back and revisit this one! Went in with high expectations as a fan of his older work which is always a dangerous thing.The hook - filming this over 12 years - I think works against the film in many ways, making it seem rather disjointed in the editing. I wonder if even having title cards showing the dates would have helped, so you aren't playing ""guess how old they are"" for the first 5 minutes after each jump! The main things that spoils the immersion - immersion normally being what Linklater is so good at - were knowing well the indie music choices (because most are bands i already know and like but i think won't capture a time nearly as well as say Dazed and Confused did). Then the clumsy long pauses of the camera on gadgetry (oh look an ipod, what year did they come out. ah an imac, an iphone - is this an Apple advert?!). Even the ensemble scenes didn't always feel right, for Linklater, you expect more? If you put this next to something like Blue is the Warmest Colour, which was mentioned in the forum, it really doesn't hold up too well imho.Hawke is natural as always and most of the best scenes are between him and the kids. There's a couple of moments of dodgy child acting early on but the kids turn out alright, in all ways.Still, there's important stuff (about growing up, coming of age, mortality) to think about and it's probably better than 90% of the movies out this year."
BOYHOOD,21 March 2015,4/10,"I think that boyhood is made with the American audience in mind. It's more American than Captain America and war movies like American Sniper. The way Mason's childhood shaped and led to bigger things was alien to me. Which should have guaranteed me a fun watch. But a movie of alien people who themselves are ordinary in their own mind and in the mind of the director is boring. The message this movie wanted to translate is purposefully ambiguous, which is itself a tired old trick that made millions for filmmakers during the years, intended for people who don't know better. When you've watched a documentary about the Masai, you've seen everyone one of them.Boyhood had a sort of happy ending because Mason is a success story, he's young, handsome, and down to earth. The last few shots of him with that girl were significant. If Mason could stop rambling about meanings in life, he could have a normal manhood. But at least it's unlikely he'll make the same mistakes as his parents. It's a fact that in the film, Mason is repeatedly, cheerfully told he's an accident. That was one of the things that confused him. For some reason, the director decided to film a series of songs strategically placed in the movie, so that the lamest ones are at the beginning - Ethan Hawke is NOT a singer - and the polished songs are at the end. I think the saddest thing in the movie business is a director trying to share his musical taste with his audience. Always reminds me of Elizabeth Town, remember that?Working class America is so violent and coarse and disruptive. I guess there's messed up stuff in any society. As a film, Boyhood will dazzle most teenagers who watch it. Now I'm not saying the movie's fans don't include adults of all kinds. It does. What I'm saying is if you find Boyhood groundbreaking and profound, then you're naive and exploitable easily and have a gullible mind. You are all of that, if only as a fan of cinema."
BOYHOOD,5 February 2015,10/10,"I had read that this movie was shot over a span of 13 years. The first thought that came to my mind is how did the director be so patient in shooting this film. Even though I am a fan of the ""Before"" series of Richard Linklater, I thought that since this has been shot over a span of 13 years, the continuity in the film would take a hit. But the director proved me completely wrong.This is mature story of a boy growing up with troubled parents and the way he goes through his middle & high school days. As the years progress in the movies, Ellar Coltrane progressed as an actor. By the time the movie comes to an end, you are seeing the film through his eyes. It is as though you are in his brain and going through all the pain, trouble and confusion he is undergoing on screen. Lorelei Linklater (The director's daughter) has given a neat and thorough performance. Ethan hawke in this movie has proved that he is one of the under-rated actors of Hollywood by giving the father role his best shot. But the limelight of the movie is Patricia Arquette as the Mom. The way she has brought out the problems of single parenting, troubled marriages, endless love for her children are heartfelt and surely deserve an Academy award. This movie is a must for anyone who enjoys good cinema and these kind of movies come only once in a while. So don't miss it. I am giving it a 10 star rating just for this bizarre idea and vision of the director."
BOYHOOD,30 December 2014,6/10,"Director Richard Linklater (Dazed And Confused) creates a risky concept movie with Boyhood. The story is not all that special, it's a typical coming of age movie, but rather the risk factor comes from the fact that the movie was filmed over a course of 12 years using the same cast of actors. Amazing considering anything could of happened to the actors in that stretch of time. The ""boy"" in the title is Ellar Coltrane, who plays ""Mason."" The viewer watches as he develops from a boy to a young man over the course of the film. Ethan Hawk and Patricia Arquette play his parents who are divorced and share joint custody. Hawk does a great job at playing the hippie-esque father, where as Arquette plays the repressed housewife who has taken in a new, abusive lover. The DVD is nothing to write home about in the way of special features, Q&A with the cast and a ""Making of"" is all there is. Makes sense considering the movie is almost 3 hours, a lot to fit on a BLU- RAY/DVD combo. Check out Boyhood for yourself and watch something that probably won't be attempted again."
BOYHOOD,17 May 2020,9/10,"When we were young, we could pay attention to everything around us, family, friends, life
When I grow up, I have more things to deal with, and I gradually mature.
The teenager is going to grow up, all around him is full of changes, all traces of growth, the sky around me is changing, and the person you love has his own life.Think about the way forward, but what is life in the end?
Are we always pursuing a dream or a casual talk?
Blindly want a state, blindly want to be a person, but neglect the process, the life, the struggle
The beautiful youth years are also lost by us inadvertently
Many years later I remembered everything before
Sadness, silence, crying, and calmness
Life still has to continue
In the memory, there was the young man holding his mother's hand
Don't worry about growingOne day I suddenly realized that I really grew up, my mother is old, my father has his own life, my sister is no longer with me, everything is different, and I am not a child anymoreBut everyone will grow up
Facing this world
Become someone who doesn't want to beThat teenager is not like a teenager
Lost and lost
What should I do in the future?When we really realize the next stage of life, everything in the past is old, and we are really uncomfortable when we go all over the world and rush to the pastMaybe all we have done is to go back to the past, back to the previous feeling, a family, no one left, in the innocent era, warmth and love, enjoy the best belonging to the best timesAll the past events have become a story
Are all lonely children
Can't stop the years
Hope hello
Will we still go together in the future?
Hope it will always be the moment"
BOYHOOD,5 August 2014,6/10,"Making this film is a truly spectacular feat that won't be matched for years to come, but let's talk about the storyline.The beginning was really well done, seeing this young kid sitting around doing nothing felt really organic and peaceful. He was just doing what a young kid does, it was honest and made me look forward to the rest of this movie. Unfortunately the themes started to feel a bit cluttered, putting clichés on the front line that ended up not doing much for me.It felt like it was filmed over the course of 12 years. Not because of the clear growth of the actors, but because it seemed like someone kept changing their mind on what this movie should be about. The kid grows up to be this boring pothead with blandly rebellious views on social media and human nature. It just kept feeling more and more forced the longer the movie went on. It was a gamble for Richard Linklater to hope that this kid grows up to be a great actor, or even moderate, but it didn't pay off.Overall it was an impressive achievement and thank god Richard Linklater made this movie because for the next director that wants to try this experiment out, they can watch this movie and know what not to do."
BOYHOOD,20 April 2016,9/10,"'Boyhood' is not presented as a fake documentary, but the dry, chronological presentation of various episodes in the life of the movie's subject over the course of 12 years does make it seem like one at times. The strength of the movie, besides the various performances, is how familiar these various episodes, whether happy, awkward, comic, tragic, or mundane will feel to the viewer. The important moments are not especially emphasized over those less so, and taken individually, most of the scenes seem fairly trivial. But the sum is greater than the parts, and well illustrates the movie's central theme of life being a series of random moments interspersed with the occasional milestone that you share with the family members, friends, enemies and other people that come in and out of your life."
BOYHOOD,16 September 2014,8/10,"I just returned from the cinema and am beyond speechless. This film had positive reviews, and I was not disappointed at all. Boyhood shows how from a boy throughout the years becomes a man. Mason Evans Jr., the main character, had to deal with many perils in his life, such as repeated divorce of his mother, alcoholism of his stepfather, breaking-up with his girlfriend, quarrels with his sister, and so on. Boyhood is the best film of the year. It leaves you breathless until the very last moment. The character description is so much brilliantly made, that when Bill, the second husband of Olivia,Mason's Mom starts to throw glass on everyone around him, you cannot help but yell out in pain, too. And when the broken Mom of Mason's packs him up for college, she opens up to him and complains of what kind of life has she had so far, and cries afterwards, you want to reach out in comfort to her. Director Richard Linklater has made a great job, this gets under your skin. Best acting performances: Ethan Hawke as Mason's Dad, Mason Evans Sr., Patricia Arquette as Olivia Evans, Mason's Mom, and Ellar Coltrane as Mason Evans Jr."
BOYHOOD,24 July 2014,10/10,There is not a fault that you can declare with a film that was shot for 12 years. Kept the exact same cast. And delivered a powerful movie of a boy named Mason. Its great to go and criticise movies but there was a moment that I could flaw this film. With the unnoticeable changes of years it provides you with so many segments that create such power moods that you can relate to as a person growing up. I call this a feel good film. It has its funny moments and quite frankly was enjoyable all the way through. There are dark scene that were delivered quite perfect that really left me pinned back in my seat. After watching the trailer it was fair to say I had already classed this movie as 'Beautiful' and it sure was indeed. Finding a movie these days to please you is quite a difficult task whereas this movie has a simple plot. Growing up. How you deal with yourself and what you will come across. The movie really makes you feel as though you are growing up with it. Adapting to the really likable characters is consistent. There is a lot of movies that have blew me away this year and by the forgotten director in my eyes. Linklater has really shown up to me and provides a movie that will feed your every instinct in what you love about a movie. 'Boyhood' is beautiful.
BOYHOOD,6 March 2017,9/10,"Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood' is a brilliant film about life and the struggle to find meaning. It follows a family through a twelve year period as they endure situations and tackle obstacles together. The main technical aspect of the film is a very controversial and memorable one as Linklater hired his main actors and continued to follow them for twelve years thus adding to the realism of the feature adding much poignancy to the themes. The overall direction can be considered very naturalistic and simple but there are wonderful shots of natural environments such as the beautiful river that Mason and his father visit representing the beauty of life whilst underlining the insignificance of man's role in the world.The screenplay is a touching study of the meaning of life. There is a great balance of humour and heart-rending dialogue throughout the film. At 165 minutes, the movie is a long one but the pacing was perfect and captivating that I hardly noted the film's duration. The characters each have profound dialogue in which they discuss the journey of which they (and we) are going through and question the reasoning of difficult events.The performances in 'Boyhood' are exceptional. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) starts off as relatively inexperienced and under-developed but matures as the film progresses adding substance to his character's arch. This performance is supported by the excellent Patricia Arquette who plays the mother. Arquette manages to portray the mother perfectly as she undergoes traumatic events that shape her family's life.Overall, I feel that 'Boyhood' is a technically brilliant achievement in film-making. Not only is the process fascinating in terms of the methods used to create the film but it is also a fascinating investigation into time."
BOYHOOD,29 May 2021,9/10,"At a time when TV series are incredibly popular, stretching sometimes over years a plot that, if properly and honestly narrated, would hardly last the canonical 90 minutes of a feature film, it is only refreshing, and a source of hope in the power and future of filmmaking, that a visionary and independent project such as Boyhood found a producer and the appreciation it deserves, with various awards collected across the world, at the Academy Awards, BAFTA, Berlin, Golden Globes amongst others.Orson Welles' The Other Side of the Wind, release 33 years after his death, officially holds the record for the longest movie production time in history at 48 years, but the last Welles' credited film, and few others that took years to finish, differ substantially from Boyhood which, since inception, was thought to be not only filmed but developed over a 12-year period. The only parallel that can be fairly made is with Michael Winterbottom's Everyday, shot over five years to allow for the natural ageing of the protagonists. With Boyhood, Richard Linklater realises what even one of the most innovative and visionary directors, Lars von Trier, only envisioned with his Dimension project, launched in 1991 as a film to be shot for 3' every year over a 33-year period, with a few days of shooting each year, only to be abandoned after only 6 years and released as a 27-minute short film in 2010.Linklater instead was able to reach the end of his project, and thankfully so since the final output is one of the most significant movies of the last few years and leaves an indelible mark on filmmaking. Filmed only few days every year, Boyhood was a true work-in-progress, as the script was only loosely structured at the beginning and left open to be filled with elements of the actors' lives, such as the family background of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and the director himself, as well as adapted to the natural growth of the actors and the world around. Boyhood follows Mason, a boy from Texas beautifully and naturally played by Austin-born Eller Coltrane, from age six till he goes to college twelve years later.With the phantom of The Truman Show hovering above Boyhood, the film is not only a come-of-age excellent movie, as it might be viewed with a superficial eye, but a very delicate and yet deep study of life as it unfolds for most people, and this reflects in the natural involvement that the audience experiences during the almost three hours of the film and the familiarity that oozes from the characters and their developments.Richard Linklater is not new to film projects that have a vision that goes beyond a short-term horizon, as proven by the (so far) trilogy of Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013), featuring as well Ethan Hawke. However, as challenging as that project was, it was still a relatively traditional series, or sequels, while Boyhood is unprecedented and probably the closest thing to the adherence of life and art to have reached the silver screen."
BOYHOOD,30 June 2015,8/10,"Boyhood has been on my list of movies to watch for a long time, due to its love received last Oscar season by critics and fans alike. With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes I will admit, I was a little scared of putting that amount of time into a movie that seemed so simple and possibly boring. What really could of been a poor decision, even though it truly is a good movie, was starting this movie at around 11:30 at night...Richard Linklater's Boyhood watches Mason (and the actor who portrays him Ellar Coltrane) grow up. It really is that simple which shows how truly brilliant Linklater (Dazed and Confused, School of Rock) is as a film maker that I watched this film by myself so late and never got bored. Boyhood depicts many realistic circumstances that many boys go through while going through boy hood. Everything nostalgically glorious from playing Halo 2 on the original Xbox, riding around on your bike with friends, to not so fun things like peer pressure to drink and do drugs and dealing with divorced parents. Mason's biological parents are played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, which both do a tremendous job at being superbly believable. It never shows the two while they are married but the movie uses both the maternal and paternal scope to analysis the parental role in shaping their kids. Arquette is the single mom who has been beaten down by life but dearly loves her kids even as a disciplinarian. Hawke, as the father, is a nomadic father at first who lives up in Alaska and is painted in poor light at the beginning of the film. But throughout Boyhood, Hawke deals as a vital lense into the purpose of this movie: the meaning of life. In one conversation young Mason asks the younger (probably around 2004) Hawke What the point of life, and Hawke replies, ""What's the point? I mean, I sure as S*** don't know. Neither does anybody else, okay? We're all just winging it, you know? The good news is your feeling stuff, you got to hold on to that."" Most of the meaningful take away quotes are similar to this, in asking what is the meaning of life or what should or am I doing with it? The achievement of filming a movie over 12 years and it ending up so smooth and fluid is an innovation we have never seen before and the most impressive part of Boyhood. The transitions when Mason would get a little older and older were refreshing and breathed so much life into this movie. There were no big jumps, which makes it amazing Linklater got through 12 years in less than 3 hours. Another real strength, which I mentioned a little earlier, was the cinematic relationship Mason had with Hawke and Arquette's characters as his parents. It felt so real and never did anything in Boyhood feel forced. Arquette won the Oscar for best supporting female role, which I didn't fully understand why until the next morning when I woke up (which was late because I started the movie so late). She seemed a 100% capable of being one of my friends parents, and she made a severely interesting character, same with Hawke. These really are normal people that the actors make you root for them so bad because of the realism in their performances. The only thing I didn't really like (used like for a reason, liked but didn't love the film like most people) was Linklater's grimness of life that he over emphasized. Let me explain...not with the circumstances because I know stuff like that happens all the time, but with the characters. Mason and his sister Samantha aren't what I would call a normal boy or girl. I think Linklater did this to be able to put a more philosophical touch and narrative on the movie, so I completely understand,but I think he used kind of a clichéd cast of kids that didn't go with the realistic older characters. Very minor critique because I completely understand why he did it and still was drawn and invested into mason and Samantha. Boyhood has language throughout, sexually suggestive scenes and drug use.Boyhood may of come up just a bit short of the modern masterpiece stapled to it by most critics, but Linklater made a nostalgic, innovative and realistic portrayal of boyhood, even if it over focused on the more grim aspects. Watching the movie so late was a gamble, but it surely paid off.Check Out all my reviews at: https://reviewsbycaleb.com/"
BOYHOOD,21 August 2016,8/10,"The most critically acclaimed film of the 21st century ( If you care for aggregate site ratings) is... good. Not great, but it does have some brilliantly realized moments- especially in its first hour. The film has inconsistent acting and writing- very much so in its final hour. Yet, Boyhood has a very organic quality to it that closely mimics the passage of time. It's a quality that is hard to ignore, as it is rarely done this well in film. Boyhood's first 75 minutes are pure magic. Realistic, well written, and richly detailed. If this Film was only 90 minutes long it would be getting a 10. The film begins to buckle under the lofty ambitions it sets out for, and ends up putting its head a little too far up its own ass. While I understand that a lot of teenagers do become sophomoric and pretentious like Mason does as the film climbs to its ending- it becomes annoying when every second scene is pseudo philosophy delivered poorly by high school seniors. Linklater seems to encourage these sentiments in the later sections of the film, which is disappointing, as the more subtle moments in the first half were kind of what I was expecting for its full running time. I guess I was naive and a bit too optimistic to think that the film could keep up the movie magic it had on display in its beginning sections for nearly 3 hours. Characters fall in and out this film just like friends and family do in real life. It was sometimes done well, and other times seemed like they forgot to film more scenes for certain characters in the 12 year production of this film ( I'm talking about the maternal grandma character who has one scene early in the film and is never seen again). The sister character has a big role early in the film that naturally gets smaller as she goes to college and is less a part of Mason's life.The acting in this film ranges from great ( Arquette, Hawke) to almost terrible ( Lorelei Linklater). I thought the kid that played Mason got better as the film went on ( even as his character become more insufferable) while Linklater's daughter obviously lost interest in the film and was lazing about in her role late in the film (probably why her part got smaller as the film went on). The writing got worse as the film wore on. It becomes very on the nose in the latter parts, as Linklater clearly got bored and was rushing to get the film to its abrupt ending.8 out of 10 for a noble film that was too ambitious and too strenuous to keep up the brilliance of its first half."
BOYHOOD,2 February 2021,10/10,How do i release this cinema satisfaction in my vein? I will never look at the things with the same way anymore.
BOYHOOD,8 July 2014,10/10,Boyhood is an excellent movie that was filmed for 12 years having to deal with a boy mason from 5 to 18 which is played by Ellar Coltrane which he deserves an Oscar. Richard Linklater Directs and writes probably his best film since Dazed and Confused. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette do an excellent job in this movie mason's dad and mom. Richard Linklater's Daughter Lorelei Linklater stars in this movie also as she plays as Mason's Sister Samantha. Richard Linklater needs an Oscar for this Excellent story about a boy Mason growing up through the eyes of him. Boyhood is a classic that will be up their with the Godfather.
BOYHOOD,22 March 2015,1/10,"Practically no plot. It turned out to be different than what I expected it to be. I thought it would give us an idea of what Individual Human Development was really about. But really it was nothing. All you do is see all the characters grow up. That's all that really happens. Nothing interesting or anything that relates to us through adolescence. That's what I expected the movie to be about. But it was really boring. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I was not even an hour through the movie and I just thought ""There's still almost two hours to go?"" that's when I decided to get up and leave. And I'm disappointed for saying this because I really didn't want this movie to turn out bad."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,9/10,"This film will become a classic for future generations. Many touching moments in this glimpse into what feels like real life.It spans 12 years in life of a contemporary American family through the ups and downs of bringing up children, broken relationships, struggles about jobs, education, digital world and coming of age. There are many references to culture, music, politics and events that are fresh in our memory so the movie immediately connected with me.We first meet Mason when he is 6 years old. He literally grows in front of our eyes until the film ends when he is 18. Superb acting from Ellar Coltrane is accompanied by great performances of Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and Lorelei Linklater.There is really no big plot or climax, just a series of moments throughout the years, that shape Mason's life. He watches his single mother's choices and listens to his father's wisdom while he faces the typical challenges of adolescent life. The dialog with Ethan Hawke is excellent.I hope that Richard Linklater will do a sequel at a future date, just like the three ""Before"" movies which I also considered brilliant. The story of Boyhood was well told and deserves a continuation."
BOYHOOD,31 August 2014,2/10,"I only have one word to describe this movie: pointless. The traditional cue to a film crew, prior to shooting, is ""Lights Camera Action!"" Well, here, someone forgot to call for action. The film is 165 minutes of banality, without any artistic value. The camera work is simplistic. The dialogues are superficial babble. Merely showing the everyday life of a typical US family is not cinema: it's a home movie.True, I forget. This was filmed over a 12-year period. This is the only slightly distinctive feature of this horrible movie. This extensive period of filming reminded me of Nikita Mikhalkov's outstanding Anna: 6-18, that I had seen in 1994 when it came out. While Mikhalkov painted a stunning and compelling picture of the evolution of his daughter in the faltering Soviet Union, Boyhood is a long and boring vacuum."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,10/10,"Surprisingly enough, all the overwhelming publicity and the relevant unfulfilled expectations unfortunately suffers a bit as a barricade for the overall success of the film with the mainstream audiences. People will understandably be curious about what might be hiding behind this immensely positive reception that 'Boyhood' has received from critics all around the globe, and of course, if the film will answer the big mysterious question of the day: was 12 long years really that necessary?Despite all these expectations and the film's sky high level of ambition it's basically a perplexingly small and intimate film, with a story that is quite far from what the publicity might seem to tell you. 'Boyhood' is not an attempt to be a tension filled and intense drama about a boy's complicated upbringing, but rather a film that tries to capture life's realistic and most precious moments all the way from child to adult. The film is about moments in life, not necessarily periods, and there are no annoying writings that pop up on the cinema screen along the way, to provide information about where we are in time – because that is completely irrelevant – as an audience we should feel the moments, not be informed about them. This film is consequently not just simple pretentious and pitiful nonsense with ""style over substance"", even though some might be tempted to believe just that. The style here is to strengthen the substance of the story, not overshadow it.For a film with such a youthful title as 'Boyhood' it's a surprisingly mature expansion of Richard Linklater's wide talents in story telling, which appear smarter and more sophisticated here, respectively, than in previous works – a great and astonishing pleasure to attend! The film is even maintained on a natural and comfortable level throughout, and despite the 165 minutes of playing time, the film is never boring since there's always a constant evolution in time, with the characters, and in the outside world. And because of that it's not an obligation to have been a boy to be able to relate or enjoy the film's undeniable qualities. The focus of the film is as much on what happens around Mason, such as the evolving technology, culture and politics.The film's true midpoint in all this is, however, still the main character's life and upbringing and there are both dark and light periods to discover in Mason's life. Usually it's the actual story of a film that provides the thread of coherence from start to finish, but in this case it is a person, in which 'Boyhood' succeeds exceedingly well. One can say that there are a few well-known clichés to find; such as the father who comes and goes, the mother undergoing numerous divorces and relationships, and bullying by school pupils as well as by the strenuous siblings at home. But then one might also conclude that all this has become clichés for a reason? It's something a wider audience will understand and relate to themselves, and counting 12 years of dealing with adolescence and adulthood boiled down to a running time of 165 ""short"" minutes, we can assume that it's hardly unknown and incomprehensible situations we wish to be portrayed in this film?So please do overwhelm us with the honest childhood and what we remember most from the time period of the film. Fill us with the wizarding literature recitation in the pleasing company of Harry Potter, the old nostalgic video games and consoles, earlier versions of well-known computer brands and other gadgets and the joy of the time when technology wasn't as dominant – and that's exactly what director Richard Linklater does so astoundingly well. 'Boyhood' is a film consisting of periods, experiences, moments, life, development, maturity, and more. If only one is engaged enough then you will also become interested enough in the character's life as time passes by. You feel with them, and you understand them. Linklater almost has the power to make his audience feel like some sort of a passive parent, who sit securely and a tad restless in the cinema seats, while their cinematic adoptive son is being sent out into the big world... And it has to be said, that is something that requires great humanistic understanding and especially great talent.Certainly one of the most fundamental elements of a film of this caliber is based on the visual and editing aspect. It is important to have a natural approach to every scene, and the camera must be present in the film but without being a distracting factor. Furthermore the technical aspect mustn't feel like a pointless provision of moments but as a part of them. The atmosphere must be caught when it's there and not least in the right way.With 'Boyhood' all these mentioned factors are certainly not absent. There has clearly been thought about every single element throughout, especially in regard to the editing which liquidly moves its focus from one periodic milestone to another. The transitions are a mixture of perfect image composition and editing, which contribute to the natural shift from past to future. As an audience you're quickly and easily becoming immersed into the story and you'll rarely notice the longstanding gaps that occur between scenes.SHORT SUMMARY: Richard Linklater has planted twelve fruitful trees and let them take root in life's most treasured moments. He has maintained his focus throughout the process and ultimately once again proves his worth as an innovative master of the art of film. If even possible, this is the director's largest and most far-ranging project yet, and quite possible his most intimate and complete film to date. A masterpiece that is completely its own and which I hope will be seen and loved again 12 years from now. A film about the passage of time deserves to be taken up again as time passes by, and 'Boyhood' is certainly no exception..."
BOYHOOD,12 December 2014,5/10,"I would give even less if not beautiful camera man work. Needles to say - don't go into movies to watch it - unless you want to have a good sleep.Good points: - good camera work - idea of filming the same actors through 12 year periodSad and Bad: - dull story of usual children and usual adults. - way into adultery - no intrigue - no action - no good humor - just dull story that was filmed over 12 years.Sorry, but I don't see this film as a nominate for international awards."

BOYHOOD,23 December 2014,3/10,"Ward Cleaver was a feckless slacker and knocked up June and fled to Alaska leaving June with an 8 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. June moves house to be near her mother who will 'help' so she can go back to school and finish her degree and get a better paying job. She marries her professor who is twice her but has a nice big house and two children who are about the same age as her own. He turns out to be an overbearing and abusive drunk. They flee. She then becomes involved with a well meaning prison guard. I think she leaves again but I may have dosed off. Meanwhile we see the Beaver character have 'quality' moments with his real Dad who has broken his heart because he sold the cool muscle car that he promised him in the third grade to buy a minivan to accommodate his new family. This must be his transition to the 'real' Ward Cleaver as he now wears a suit and tie and works for an insurance company. The Beaver wins 2nd place in a photo contest after spending all his time in the dark room in the age of digital as he has artistic depth. He wins a small scholarship and goes off to college as far away as he can get as long as its still in Texas. His Mom, in saying goodbye recounts all the milestones in her life and bursts into tears as she realises that sending her youngest off to college is the last one. All that is left is her funeral or so she tells him. She appears to have gained weight and will be moving into her mother's tiny apartment. He arrives at some college in the middle of nowhere, meets his dorm mate, his dorm mate's girl friend and her room mate. They take mushrooms and go hiking. The friend of his new room mate's girl friend and he are watching as the room mate and girl friend howl like coyotes and yell stuff. The friend of the room mate says, ""You know how people are always talking about 'seizing the moment'?""Yeah."" He says ""Well, I think it really the other way around."" He agrees sort of.The End.Appendix: Briefly seen are the following. Beaver gets a bad haircut. He checks out lingerie ads in a catalogue. He's teased by mean boys. His friend shows him internet porn. Big kids give him a beer. His girl friend dumps him because she likes someone else who is older and perhaps less boring.The 3 stars are all for Patricia Arquette without whom the movie would be completely unbearable."
BOYHOOD,9 September 2014,10/10,"Sometimes, I see a movie that is not like anything else I have ever seen. A list of these films for me would include Gravity, Inception, (believe it or not) Les Miserables, and Flight.I guess I'll be adding Boyhood to that list as well.However, unlike the other films on this list, what makes Boyhood unique is not its story, its characters, or its themes: it's the production. As some of you may know, Boyhood was shot in less than fifty days over twelve years with the same cast and crew. Talk about a gamble. There was no telling what would happen if one of the principal actors just suddenly died or if the director's own daughter, playing Mason's sister, decided not to be in her dad's movie anymore. Thankfully, the entire cast and crew stayed together for all twelve years of production, making one of the most unique films of all time. Without this method of production, we wouldn't have the unique story, deep characters, or the rich themes present in Boyhood.So, what is the unique story of Boyhood? Believe it or not, the story in itself is not unique at all: the film's plot consists of a traditional coming-of-age story about a boy (Mason) growing up with a constantly changing dysfunctional family unit. However, the specifics of what Mason would be interested in and what challenges he would deal with were developed throughout production, making it appear like we are not as much watching a movie as we are real life. Director Richard Linklater said that he was ""totally ready to adapt the story to whatever he (Ellar Coltrane, the actor who plays Mason) is going through."" This really shows in lots of little moments like when Mason being bullied or when he starts hanging out with the wrong crowd. Yes, these may appear to be a little clichéd, but they are perfectly placed in the grand scheme of things.That is another area where Boyhood really succeeds. It has this second, more complex layer that underlies its seemingly simple story and characters. Most of the characters may seem archetypal at first: Olivia, the single mom struggling to make ends meet; Mason, Sr., the absentee biological dad who just seems to want to have fun. However, they change drastically throughout the story, with all of them undergoing many transformative experiences. For example, Mason, Sr., really gets his life together by the film's conclusion. I can't go into many more details because they could spoil the ending, but I can tell you that there are countless examples of this second, deeper layer to Boyhood.The acting of this film is also incredible and natural. Granted, this is to be expected with the production method of the film. However, both Patricia Arquette as Olivia and Ethan Hawke as Mason, Sr., do award-worthy work. Arquette shines through in many of the more jarring scenes, especially when dealing with an abusive, alcoholic husband. Hawke, meanwhile, is a chameleon, constantly reminding us that his character is not who we think he is. The rest of the principal cast is highly deserving of acclaim as well, as Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater do phenomenal work, never once letting us believe that they are not their characters.Thematically, Boyhood will resonate with almost everyone who watches it. Why is this, you ask? Simple: it is dealing with the universal process of growing up. It also covers both genders well, as we watch Mason and his sister Samantha grow up simultaneously. The process of growing up deals with many themes in itself such as sibling rivalry, addiction, dysfunctional families, teen substance use, sex in high school, and going off to college. I don't think that any other movie covers all of these in one sitting and does it this well.Boyhood is the best film I have ever seen. Period. There's a lot of technicality to it, but what makes it a winner is its rich themes and beautiful construction of Mason. It is one of the very few films in which we feel like we are watching real life and not a film. And that's the reason to watch it."
BOYHOOD,13 January 2015,10/10,"Richard Linklater has proved himself to be our primary guide to cinematic time travel. Whether it's in his Before Trilogy which captures the arc of a relationship over a decade or his lighter fare like Dazed and Confused which looks back on our teenage years through the lens of nostalgia, he has shown an uncanny ability to demonstrate on screen the subtleties of how time affects us all. Boyhood, which was shot over twelve years, following characters as the actors that play them literally age, is Linklater's magnum opus. The persistence and determination of the all involved in the production is admirable and they deserve the attention they are receiving, however what is more remarkable is the film itself. A film so modest, light, and carefree and yet so powerful, Boyhood is the antithesis of the modern Hollywood blockbuster (Interstellar) characterized by their pomposity and heavy handedness. Here is a film that never claims it is telling us anything and yet in the end tells us everything."
BOYHOOD,13 July 2014,10/10,"By some miracle, the run time of this movie has proved to be the exact same length as that of the forth installment of the Transformers franchise. Having slogged through nearly three hours of robots hitting robots shot from a camera permanently fixed between the thighs of our lead female protagonist a week earlier, Richard Linklater's latest contribution to modern cinema was a more than welcome reminder that visionary filmmakers still exist, and that the actual run time compared to how long the run time feels speaks much of film quality. Boyhood documents the early life of a boy called Mason, beginning at six, then continuing all the way through middle-school, high school and eventually his move to college at eighteen years of age. Although the story line is fairly simplistic and one might argue, unadventurous, the sheer ambition of the director is reason enough to hand your money over; shot over twelve years with the same group of actors, audiences can experience the true evolution of a character like never before.However as Linklater said himself, if the audience see this merely as an experiment, then he has failed at his task. The movie has its own story to tell. The aforementioned criticism of an overly simplistic plot is what makes the story so identifiable not just for young people, but for adults as well; the film could easily be called 'adulthood' or 'parenthood' or even take a more generalised title of 'Life' - Linklater understands people, and is therefore one of the few modern filmmakers who understands the importance of well-rounded, interesting and relatable characters to tell a story.When watching Boyhood, you don't think of the ramifications, the possible pitfalls and how difficult it must have been to make. You instead choose to enjoy it at surface level, only truly appreciating the sheer brilliance of what has been achieved after the film. This really is a once-in-a-lifetime film and therefore a once-in-a-lifetime experience for anyone watching it. Soon to be a modern classic, this is a picture that will be looked back on as one of the greatest ever made."
BOYHOOD,16 July 2014,3/10,"When I first heard of this film I thought, 'Wow, this actually sounds really good'.Unfortunately this is where I disagree with the majority of critics - this film was not good. It starts off quite well, but from there it becomes far too preachy and I ended up paying more attention to the change in characters appearance than the actual story.The film is far too long and at times, lets scenes drag on and on, to the point where people in the cinema actually started talking to each other rather than listen to Mason give his overreaching speech on humanity. I don't think i've disliked a lead as much as this one in a long time. In terms of the other cast, they're easily forgettable - the second husband, what happened to him? his kids? I had expected a ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" experience but was left disappointed. As great as it was having the same characters for 12 years, 12 years should've produced a much better story than this."
BOYHOOD,13 January 2015,1/10,"I usually love slow burning character driven movies where the plot moves at a pace that dictates character development and depth.Then I realised that there was still over 1 HOUR to go.AND NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.......and NOTHING looks like it will happen.And I don't care what happens. JUST MAKE IT STOP.So I did......I stopped watching. Now I am relieved.Because MOMENTS AGO.......I turned into Peter Finch and began raving.I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.What is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie.I DON'T care what happens to the BOY, the MOM, the SISTER or that DAD.I am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality fantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty.I HATED THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
BOYHOOD,29 August 2014,2/10,"When I heard about this movie over summer in China, I was so excited that I prayed it would still be in theaters when I came back. And it was still in theaters when I came back.But it's NOT worth 99% on rotten tomatoes or an 8.8 here. And it's not worth an Oscar nomination. I'm just glad they didn't take it all the way.Just because you took 12 years filming this doesn't mean you get to geta 99% RT and an 8.8 IMDb without deserving it.And honestly, I don't agree with any of the people saying how we should appreciate their efforts. Look, the director gathered the people around once every year for like 3 days or something, to film a script that was made up impromptu. There was no effort in planning this film. They practically didn't even pay anybody to write a script. Also, judging from how abysmal the acting was (I didn't even feel that Arquette deserved her Oscar and Hawke deserved his nomination), I don't think they gave much effort at all. And come on, the budget was 2.4M... One episode of the big bang theory beats this. The best I can say is that they had patience. But I don't think you can make a bad film good just because they refused to recruit more actors and employ CGI to do the aging effects.Okay let's talk about this movie. It had no plot, other than showing us ""look, he got taller, he cut hair, he grew back hair, he's drinking, kissing a girl, breaking up with a girl, going to college..."" Look, I know this film is supposed to be about everyday life, so I wasn't even expecting an epic storyline, but this is too boring. Modern Family is about everyday life, and you see the kids growing up, but there's something worth watching in the episodes. The only purpose of Boyhood is showing you, look, the kids grew up and the parents got wrinkles. While I can appreciate how time flies, how kids grow taller and adults grow wrinkles is really not worth making a movie about.I grew up almost in the same time, I think I'm 2 years above the boy... but Mason's journey didn't click with my teen life at all, and this is coming from a Harry Potter fan. Maybe other people can relate to this, but even if you do, it doesn't exempt this movie from having no plot and no meaning. Also the movie shows you some historic moments, just for the sake of saying, ""oh look, we're at 2008 and Obama's running for president"". I get it, you want to time stamp this, but what the heck does it have to do with your story?And for everybody who's saying ""but that's how real life is"", NO, this is not how real life is. Things happen in real life. We make mistakes and we learn from them and correct ourselves. We grow older not only physically but also mentally and spiritually. We have aspirations and we work towards them. We have a purpose in life, besides whining and wondering what's the point. And we have relationships that are romantic and memorable. It's not just about getting together and separating without even bothering to learn their names.And let's look at the characters. They're all very unlikable and extremely one dimensional, or even zero dimensional. The only traits on both stepfathers were their abusiveness. The mother was just there to make bad decisions and wonder why her life is so miserable in the end. The father was just a hipster. Mason was simply whiny and passive, and I don't even think Samantha had a personality besides her selfishness. I've never seen a lead cast that's more boring and unlikable in my life. I don't remember myself ever judging on appearance, but these characters really have the worst hair style choice I've ever seen, and Mason's languid and feminine appearance really bugs me. Why would you design a character like this? What purpose does it serve? Anyway I heard that the actor is gay, and while it explains, it actually makes it worse. I have nothing against the gay community, my best friend is bisexual, but actors need to be their characters instead of themselves in their films. So please hide your gayness when you're playing a straight character.So that's pretty much it. If you want to pay money to just watch the cast age, go ahead. If you're actually looking for something inspiring, don't expect to find that in boyhood. It's pretty much just a timeline with a bunch of messed up one dimensional characters and abysmal acting talents. The opening with the Coldplay song was the only good thing about the movie, it went insufferably bad after that. So I'd recommend buying Coldplay's records than watching this movie."
BOYHOOD,28 November 2018,10/10,"For those people writing how ""boring"" this movie is, and saying that ""nothing"" happens, are missing the whole point of what a movie is supposed to do.A movie is an emotional roller coaster, whether that follows from some gimmicky story or contrived plot is totally optional. Linklater does this completely on the rocky turbulence of growing up itself, in a way, boyhood is dramatised to relate to the aspects of growing up we can all relate to. Maybe you didn't drink, but you got your first car- Boyhood does its best for the viewer to relate themselves to such a picture.If you cannot comprehend this fact then the movie will lose all meaning to you, and you have rejected even participating in it before allowing yourself to take it in. In this way, you haven't really watched the movie. You're just waiting for it to end.The pacing in this movie was excellent for the most part, except maybe towards the VERY end, where it ends on a Hollywood, hopeful emote (wish it could've ended with a hug goodbye from the mother we grew up to sympathise with and love!)Otherwise, this movie really does its best with excellent writing and dialogue to bring out the essence of childhood and adolescence out of your deep consciousness again, not so you can be judged by them, but so you can dance with them- in the same way the pictures in the film dance with all the memories."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,7/10,I am watching this movie right. And I am halfway through it. And I think Ethan Hawke is really annoying. Anybody else? He always sounds like he needs to clear his throat. And he's too perky and jazzed up. Maybe it's the facial hair that makes him look annoying. But he's too enthusiastic. And he sounds like he has a cold and needs to clear his throat. But it's like he's trying to hard to be cool. Really annoying to me... anybody else? It's a really raspy voice. Very annoying. Anybody else? He always sounds like he needs to clear his throat.

BOYHOOD,12 August 2014,8/10,"There is some novelty to watching the actors literally age on-screen, but Boyhood's real charm is in taking you back to those seminal moments in your life and experiencing those emotions again. (For most of us, it'll be Mason falling in love with Sheena.) Suspending disbelief and empathizing with these characters is just so darn easy. Though it's quite good, the two-hour and forty minute running time means that there are more than a few moments where the action on the screen simply isn't compelling, but it doesn't take away from Boyhood's wonderful moments.In closing, I'd say that if you enjoy indie films, Boyhood is going to be right up your alley. If you don't, it might be best to netflix it."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,7/10,"Every now and then, you come across a film that you see with a group of people, whether it be friends or family, and you all exit the theater and you're all discussing how, in one way or another, something in that film was relatable to your life. Few films can accomplish the task of not only capturing history accurately but capturing the way people felt during that era that they lived through. Richard Linklaters' Boyhood may prove to be the one film that has been able to capture a particular era in time in which every person who views it can find some familiarity and nostalgia from more than any other.Filmed over the course of 12 years, we follow the growth of Mason from ages 7 to 18. We watch not only him change before our eyes but also his family and society around him. Mason begins as a rather stoic character as he always seems to be locked into his own head as we watch him go through life wondering what he's thinking. As he grows older and experiences more of what his life has offered him, which is a series of drastic ups and downs, is when we see him begin to open up and express himself and use those past experiences to help shape who he wants to be.You not only see the growth of Mason but of his family members as well. We watch the progression of his mother (Patricia Arquette) and father (Ethan Hawke) from young, immature, and unprepared parents to being grounded, responsible, and emotionally present for their kids. Children of divorce can relate to the pain of not being able to share your life with both parents and the confusion of how you're supposed to act towards one or the other based on how one Any parent can watch their growth and see similar mistakes that they made as well as similarities in how they put themselves back together.There are so many slight details in this film that can jar your memory and bring you back to a different time of your life, whether good or bad, almost as if it flashes before your eyes. It allows you to see how far you've grown as a person and how the things in your life have influenced you and made you who you are today. One thing that I always take into account when I decide how good a movie is is the re-watch ability factor. There are so many ""good"" films that you only need to see once but know you'll never watch them again (The Kings Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave to name a few) and then there are films that have that ability to either bring something new or regenerate that original enjoyment you had the first time you saw it (Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Saving Private Ryan). Boyhood has tremendous re-watchability (my own word) potential because feelings of nostalgia never get old and being able to reminisce, even if it's by yourself, is what makes the film truly special."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,5/10,"For starters, any movie that is 2 hours and 45 minutes long had better have some action in it or it runs the risk of losing the audience. For me this movie was at least 45 minutes too long. The beginning showed promise but along the way I found more to dislike than like. First, I have to say that I really liked Patricia Arquette in this role. She seemed so natural as the mother who deals with bad marriages, single parenthood, and a life that didn't quite go the way she had hoped. She never overacted once and I related to her emotional states. Two things bothered me about the film, once is the boy's sister. rude and impertinent from the start I wondered how that behavior was left unchecked. Its like no one tried or cared enough about her to intercede and set her straight. Second, the boy himself grew increasingly unlikable with his laid back, mumbled manner. I found it harder to care what happened to him.I judge a movie by the question ""would I ever watch this again""? The answer would have to be no. I didn't hate it, but it was too long and too annoying. I'm not even sure I would recommend it to most people. However, I am sort of glad that I saw it as I did relate a lot to the mother and her plight. I don't know about boyhood but it certainly put some perspective on motherhood."
BOYHOOD,7 September 2019,4/10,"What are the chances of a child actor growing up to be a good actor? We all know the answer. Someone put all his eggs in one basket, and this basket was a regular charming seven-year-old who - like most - ended up as an awkward teenager. Great if it were a documentary. But it's not. Ellar is just smiling his way through the second half of the movie, and laughs in every line. Nothing he says is beliveable. Fun concept but doesn't work irl."
BOYHOOD,26 March 2016,6/10,"First, let me just say that the very concept of filming the same people over the course of 12 real years for a project like this should be commended. The very idea is unique and the result does not disappoint. It was so fascinating to watch this young man grow up before our very eyes! Now, down to the ugly truth. The movie was a failure. It told a hard story about a rough life for a young man to endure. At times, I found myself bored and wondering if the 3 hours that it took to watch someone else's life would be better spent on mine. As he gets older, you start to think that this movie is finally getting somewhere. The movie is starting to feel like you've been through so much and things are going great. Then... all of a sudden... they end it. Its not a happy ending, nor a sad ending. Its just an ending that leaves you with questions and assumptions that will ultimately never be answered or validated. This movie will make you throw things in frustration while you ask yourself, ""What the hell kind of ending was that?! It took them 12 YEARS to come up with THAT ending?!"""
BOYHOOD,28 January 2017,5/10,"""... a scintillating, sizzling explosion of cinematic fireworks; a dazzling, dizzying, break-neck roller coaster ride that leaves you breathless and thunderstruck.""That excerpt from a review would apply to a typical Ingmar Bergman offering when stacked up against Boyhood.Boyhood, of course, is not an action packed film, nor is it an exciting one. It is best described as the work of a great painter. No, not Picasso or Modigliani, but more like Bob from Bob's Painting and Drywall. Bob may do a wonderful job on your walls, but I don't expect you'll want to spend much time sitting in a chair staring at his final product.Yes, this is a well made film, and some of the acting - particularly that of Ethan Hawke - is fine, but what can you say about a movie that serves up such original lines as ""I'm glad you were born"" and ""Don't forget to floss""?I should also mention the performance of Ellar Coltrane who plays the main character Mason. Coltrane's lethargic acting immensely adds to the soporific qualities of this film. He really could have benefited from a few cups of espresso before stepping in front of the camera. In fact, I also recommend a good shot of caffeine for anyone intent on watching this.Writer/director Richard Linklater apparently uses Turtle Pacing Technology, a revolutionary new technique wherein a film that takes twelve years to make somehow also manages to make the audience feel as if they have just spent an equal amount of time in their theater seats.This new technology should have been nominated for a Scientific and Technical Award Oscar. Incidentally, the Academy's Sci-Tech awards are no longer broadcast on television due to the fact that they are ""too exciting"" according to Richard Linklater.So if you are in the mood for cavalierly tossing aside nearly three hours of your adulthood, then by all means have a look at Boyhood."
BOYHOOD,15 October 2016,4/10,"I think the only great thing about Boyhood was technical: the characters actually truly aged. So the audience was free of the customary burden of suspension of disbelief which accompanies the usual makeup or cast-changes that provide ""aging"" in other films. As pleasurable as this was...Aside from that, I also liked the film and it's cast and their acting, but I think none of those things remotely deserved a best picture award. I'd love to see real aging in a film that did.I imagine for many it was that film. And I imagine for a few, the pleasure of being free of the burden of suspension of disbelief intoxicates their assessment of the film.I'll note that I'm a big fan of the director, and frankly I think it's far from his best film. The ones I like more, ""Waking Life"" and ""A Scanner Darkly"", I *also* loved most for something technical(!); their rotoscope animation made them seethe and quiver with an inner energy: in them I loved feeling a view into reality usually reserved for the duration of a psychedelic trip. (But compared to ""Boyhood"") that technical accomplishment, for me, went far further in elevating those films."
BOYHOOD,28 September 2014,10/10,"Movies have been around for over 100 years now. Every year there are around 8000 films produced. Most movies are really bad, but some are also very good. I've always appreciated movies that are like experiments in film making. That's why I love directors like Darren Aronofsky, David Lynch and Jaco Van Dormael. These experiments can take years to make, but the result is always amazing.When Boyhood was announced in 2007, I forgot it nearly instantly. This was because at the time, I had only seen two movies from Richard Linklater. School of Rock and Fast Food Nation. While School of Rock was one of my favorite movies back then, Fast Food Nation was not really that great. So the years went by, but when the trailer was released in 2011 I remembered the project.So for three years I've been looking forward to Boyhood. Today, when I went with my family to watch the movie, I was so impressed. I had very high expectations, but the movie was even better than I expected. What a movie it was. Boyhood is a movie about a boy growing up, from the age 5 to 18. As you probably know, Richard Linklater spent 12 years making the movie with the same actors. Only by thinking of that, I'm impressed. I don't want to tell anything about what happens to the boy (Mason) during the years in the since then it won't be as fun to watch, but it is for most part a normal life. That is what makes the movie so special. The plot isn't special in any way, the dialogue is not so special anything but the whole experience and the actors is what makes the movie so good. Ellar Coltrane, Ethan Hawke and especially Patricia Arquette did a fantastic in Boyhood. Some superb directing by Richard Linklater didn't hurt either.I felt like Mason many times during my childhood, and I'm pretty sure everyone did. Boyhood is a movie that everyone should watch. It's a future classic that I hope will win the Oscar for best picture! Very good job Richard Linklater, I can't wait for your next big project."
BOYHOOD,21 August 2014,9/10,"It was truly delight to watch this movie where you can easily relate to each aspect, stages of your life until you become the young adult. This movie is all about how little things in life is so important and counts towards the person you become. I'm from India from a middle class background but still I can feel the same closeness with this character which makes me wonder how everyones life is so closely related and no matter where they came from. Here, all credit goes to Linklater as he chose all those moments which are very close to everyone's heart.That ability of his collect all those moments and convert them into 165 mins long movie is a work of genius.Until now I have seen his movies which generally span over a 24 hours or so. with this feature he has not only challenged himself but in that effort gave an original piece of art which will be remembered as one of his best masterpiece till date.Looking at the cast I couldn't help saying how beautifully Patricia Arquette played the role of Mom. She is the heart of this movie where every emotion originates and ends .Truly she puts up great performance which in my opinion calls out for academy to take a notice of it.The other performance from Ethan Hawke, Ellar Coltrane,Lorelei Linklater were also noticeable and awesome.The soundtrack of the movie is mix of songs released in these 12 years which also helps to brings some memories if you know them.An original, unique, artistic, beautifully crafted limited edition movie is limitless in all ways."
BOYHOOD,24 December 2014,9/10,For some people including myself you tend to be able to relate to a lot of the events in Masons life as he continues to age. The nostalgia that these relations create can bring both good and bad memories up and impacts like no other film can. I have to say a lot of the tough situations mason had to endure (drunk stepfathers) I can really relate to and I could feel the strong intensity in some of those moments. However not everyone has these same experiences and thus not having that nostalgic effect.So basically your enjoyment of the film is really all a matter of how much you can relate to it. Heck at one point in the film Masons journey took a different turn than what mine did thus ending the ability to relate and from there I could see why some people hated it but the way I looked at it to enjoy it was that either way I was watching the life of this person and being given the opportunity to see this new perspective.When I lost the ability to relate with Mason on his journey i started to almost dislike him for certain things for some reason. When I watched this film I didn't feel like I was watching a movie I felt like I was going through life with Mason. Others may not be able to do that but I was fortunate enough to experience it like this.In conclusion this is a really love it or hate it type movie. If you can relate to some experiences it can be very enjoyable but for others it can seem very boring and pointless. I can really see both sides but I definitely enjoyed the film and In those final credits I nearly teared up because I just realized what I had experienced. This is hard to explain but if you understand then you obviously get what I'm saying. I hope you don't waste 165 minutes of your life I hope you experience this film the same way I did if not more so. I hope what I said is helpful thanks for reading my review.
BOYHOOD,10 October 2019,9/10,"I get why this film isn't for everyone, but personally, I was exactly the gloomy 'boring' kid Mason portrays, and maybe that's why it worked so well. This film does a great job at showing life as it passes by, and I particularly love how the parents are included with their own struggles. I was left pondering life a lot, and that's an achievement. There are enough movies with exciting concrete plots, but not every movie benefits from it. The realism of the mundane in Boyhood is what makes it work. It's very relatable, and rarely feels scripted at all."
BOYHOOD,28 September 2015,,"I have no clue what I have just watched, this has to be the most pointless and forgettable movies of the year . Yes I get what the selling point of the movie is, it was a coming of age movie that followed a boy into adolescence over the span of 8 years. Yes this is novel and a producers deserve praise on this front. But there was literally no storyline.Don't be worried about spoilers either because there are bloody none. If this is the storyline's we make movies of these days, then i might as well just film myself over the span of a day going to work, star bucks and then returning home. But who the hell would want to watch such an uncompelling boring movie?. Well apparently the hipsters who gave this an undeserving 8/10."
BOYHOOD,17 April 2016,1/10,"I sat through the entire long runtime of almost 3 hours, did not break a smile, was not exited at any point, I did not know what was going on. In fact, I did not feel any connection to the story what so ever. If anything I was 100% lost. I had no idea what was going on at any point in this movie, the story was just so complex with too many characters, too many stories, to many problems at the same time. Its like getting the first 2 seasons of a T.V. family comedy that no one knows about and packing it in a movie, but they took out some episodes so you don't know what's going on. and they took out all the funny bits. Throuout the first bit of the movie, I didn't learn the names of the main characters, I couldn't even figure out who they were. so when they all grew up (I think that's what happened) I did not know who anyone was any more, and so I started from square one, trying to figure out who's who??? This movie just sucked and was a complete waist of time!! do not watch"
BOYHOOD,23 August 2017,10/10,"Linklater has done some amazingly arty things throughout his largely unheralded career as an indie filmmaker. From plot less party triumphs to cartooned dreamscapes, he's tried a vast number of approaches and ideas to rejuvenate and enhance and upend Hollywood cliché. ""Boyhood"" is arguably his sweetest attempt, and certainly his best in terms of coherence and amicability... it's impossible not to relate to this simple story about an off-beat boy named Mason growing up in suburban America. His sister too is a marvel, especially when hitting her early teens (after which she turns mediocre and takes a backseat to the star, her younger brother. Mason is consistently easy-going throughout the 12 years of filming, almost irritating so until he finds his passion in photography. Technology intrudes and progresses too, but not in a way that jeopardizes the storyline. His dad (Hawke) is an enviable father figure who spoils his kids on the weekends, and his mom (Arquette) shines as a complex mother who's got issues that she never allows to overshadow her life or that of her kids. Seamlessly integrated from start to finish, it's as though all movies are built this way when in fact it's such an original that viewers will likely need to remind themselves that it took over a decade to put this work of genius together. It's one drawback is a heavy hand hammering home a hippy mentality - very few people who live the hippy lifestyle have it so good. That being said, it's definitely worth investing two hours of your life on. The characters become infectious and you wonder how those 12 years went by as quickly and as quietly as life itself."
BOYHOOD,3 September 2018,2/10,Take any kid in your neighbourhood right now that you see playing outside or having fun with his friends and then imagine him growing up to when he's 16.. that's how interesting and riveting this movie is...
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,8/10,"Is there a more ambitious or unforgettable film as Richard Linklater's Boyhood this year? I think not.Having generated enthusiastic hype and unanimous critical acclaim, it's easy to want to abstain from it and be pessimistic about this film, but why shouldn't it be subject to the critical acclaim that is has generated? It's true that, had the film not been shot over a 12 year period, it probably wouldn't have generated the amount of buzz it did; however, the film is still a great film and it still would have obtained the amount of critical praise that it has– the whole 12 year shooting aspect just makes it all the more a special and enchanting movie going experience (one of the most enchanting I've ever had).I don't imagine I can add to (or say) anything about the film that hasn't already been said about it before, but I will tell you how (when I saw this in theaters) about mid-way through I just started to cry (at a completely non-dramatic part, mind you), because I was so captivated by, not only the experience of watching these endearing characters mature, but by how the film was making me reflect back to my own boyhood and the small moments in life that are special (my favorite being the early scenes of Mason and his sister). As a side note, I am of the same age and generation of the ""boy"" in ""boyhood"" (Ellar Coltrane), so it was nothing short of a cathartic and intriguing walk down memory lane. This film defines a generation of, not only kids, but parents as well. Be it the Generation X product parent who's not quite matured yet, or the parent so preoccupied by their parental role that they become victim to a selfish-disillusionment of marriage and family. Neither of which is portrayed in a patronizing way, but merely as depiction of a part of the maturation process within the life of a child. The film is somewhat long (160 something minutes I believe), but there's never really a dull moment; for this reason, the film is quick to realize when one storyline is burned out and, like real-life, isn't afraid to quickly change direction while keeping the same overall feel and tone of the characters. By the end, you've completely forgotten that you've watched a fictitious film. Instead, you feel as though you've watched a documentary about the life of a real-life family over the course of 12 years. You forget Ellar Coltrane is playing a character, and you forget that everything on screen came from a script. This is what filmmaking is all about: Attempting to achieve something that others haven't, attempting to embrace that which is embraceable, and achieving a level of enchantment to take you to another world and forget that you're separated from the story by a glass screen.Boyhood is many things... It's a great film (one of the greatest possibly ever made), it's a film that will stand the test of time, it's a film everybody should experience, and it's (by far) the best film of 2014. Above all, it's a one of kind film- and don't let anyone tell you differently."
BOYHOOD,6 January 2021,7/10,"I think it is a great concept, but I actually got bored. There are a lot of famous people and the director is good, but after watching at the beginning I somehow stopped caring. I really like the idea as I said, I just think it was too long and there were parts that just became banal. Most of the acting was good, but again there were parts that got lost and the direction good, but not always helping the actors toward the end."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,4/10,"I would say that I appreciated the effort in filming a movie over the course of 12 years, but it actually didn't seem like much effort was taken to create a seamless movie. Sometimes the kids hardly change in appearance and the movie just jumps to another storyline without ever resolving the conflict from the last scene and you're left wondering what the heck just happened. Other times the kids have obviously had a growth spurt and you're stunned because they just shot up 6 inches from one scene to the next - again, with no real resolution from the last storyline. Often times people talk about story arcs, well this movie has 12 beginnings to arcs with no real climax or resolution - with the possible exception of minor storyline involving a worker at a restaurant. In summary, this movie is comprised of 12 loosely coupled scenes being passed around as a movie. You have more continuity watching 12 episodes of Seinfeld than you do with this movie. I really wanted to like the movie because I want more films that try to be different - but this just wasn't my cup of tea."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,10/10,"I saw all the 1 star reviews before I decided to rent this movie. I wanted to see the movie because they filmed the boy for 12 years, so I figured I'd get it. Surprisingly, this movie is not a one trick pony - as evidenced by its best picture win. It draws you in very quickly. This movie is about an intimate view of a family you soon fall in love with. Think of it more like a Forest Gump that doesn't take itself as seriously in that it has a continuing story line, like a teen movie mixed with an epic drama. There is no simple plot line, like, we found out the mayor stole the deed to the land because oil was on it! But it's about seeing the world through the eyes of someone else for a while, and you come out feeling like you know yourself a little better in the end."
BOYHOOD,19 July 2014,7/10,"Like many of Richard Linklater's films, Boyhood will will continue to inspire controversy and enjoy notoriety for many years to come. All serious film-goers will see it and discuss it. Many will love it. Some will not.As a member of Richard Linklater's Austin Film Society I was predisposed to like this film a lot. The uniformly rave reviews from festivals and major media film critics set my expectations at the highest level.I loved the director's earlier, pioneering masterstroke of experimental technique, Waking Life, and his uncanny ability to bring complex, fascinating characters to life on the screen, as in Bernie. I'm not a big fan of his slacker films, but Boyhood bore the promise of what I saw as the best of Linklater's filmography: applying an unprecedented and challenging creative methodology to a story about the evolution of characters over time. Wow!My wife warned me that I was setting myself up for disappointment. She was right. The film turned out to be a lengthy, disappointing, mockumentary about the evolution of a slacker. The production values were uniformly good, earning an A for effort, but the narrative line meandered aimlessly as moderately interesting characters aged, a C at best. Overall, a B minus. (7/10 stars)Over the course of 12 years Mason, a thoughtful, energetic, and charming little boy turns into a passive, whining cipher who walks like a zombie. His mother serenely makes innumerable bad life choices but unexpectedly implodes as her youngest leaves for college, while his estranged father evolves from slacker to relatively responsible adult - about 10 years too late to have any redeeming value to his son. Linklater's daughter, Lorelei plays Samantha, an almost unremittingly insensitive and obnoxious child, even as a twenty year old. The principal adult actors, Arquette and Hawke, as well as the supporting cast of step-parents, friends and relatives did a highly professional job, portraying complex, multi-dimensional characters who grew and changed over the course of the film. Sadly, the ostensible focal point of the exercise, the boy, devolved into another irresponsible slacker. According to a local interview with the director, Lorelei asked early on if her character might be allowed to die, ending her participation in the creative endeavor. Perhaps she anticipated the lack of universal acclaim for her father's most recent effort - a noble experiment, but to some, a disappointing result."
BOYHOOD,17 October 2015,7/10,"Boyhood has to be the most highly overrated film of 2014. Though the story is good, it's not great. Boyhood follows the life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college. The film is too long and drags. Though the story is unoriginal, what sets it apart is that it was filmed over the course of 12 years.The girl who played the sister was fun and energetic in the beginning, but lost her flare really fast. She, in my opinion, was the worst character in the film. Patricia Arquette did a great as the mom, but who really impressed me was Ethan Hawke.Overall, Boyhood is average. The story didn't hold my attention throughout the film. Boyhood was a bit too long and would have been more effective had it been shorter."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,6/10,"Whilst I admire the technical achievement of editing what must have been a mound of material from over more than a decade into a reasonably coherent story, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a television soap opera. In a series of episodic scenes we see Mason Junior and his sister growing up fairly gently through the usual challenges of childhood, his mother go through a series of bad choices for partners and Mason's father change from being a flighty ne'er-do-well into a responsible family man, albeit not with Mason's mother.It's all very pleasantly done, even the supposedly tense and confrontational moments, and it's beautifully shot, but I was fidgeting in my seat from an early point and the film never really held my attention.The unusual background to this film is remarkable. However, the film itself is not."
BOYHOOD,15 September 2015,9/10,"This movie is about life of a man. The story begins the time he is 6 years old, and he gets old. One actor has played for 12 years, so we can watch his growth in details and sympathize with him. It is very novel because the filming continues for many years on and off. Therefore, we can follow his growth easily.The main character is gentle and timid, and becomes a little strange. His parents divorce, so he must move to the place that he can't meet his friends. After, his mother marries new man. He gets a new family, but this new father causes a big problem. Also, he experiences his spring of life such as love. I like his ties with his former father. They are best friends, and the scenes of them warm my heart. In conclusion, everyone must sympathize with this movie and doesn't know what to say."
BOYHOOD,5 September 2016,4/10,"Boyhood was praised to the high heavens when it was first released, scoring a 100% on rotten tomatoes and earring 6 Oscar nominations including best picture and many critics labelling it as the best film of 2014. And I fail to understand why, yes the gimmick of watching the same group of actors grow up together in one piece of media is intriguing, but that's all it is: a gimmick. I admire the commitment and that's all. Another positive are the performances of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette who are Bon fantastic and really pull of the emotional Punch that film is lacking in every other aspect, Arquette truly deserved her Oscar. My problems are berry thing else. He main boy is bland and completely lacking in personality, notice how I didn't refer to him by name, beanies he's so bland and forgettable. The film claims to be a character study of this boy yet we know nothing about his personality only what's happened to him. And we never see how this stuff affected him, he seems more like a bystander in his own life's do this film than our main protagonist. I can't comment on his acting as he does what is required of him which is stand here and look blank. He only develops a personality once he goes to college and then he becomes and annoying, pretentious douche who's trying to hard to be philosophical yet comes across and a pretentious moron. The actress is playing his sister is terrible and she dosn't even get better as she gets older, she remains annoying and wooden throughout the whole movie. As far as the gimmick goes, well if I wanted to watch the same group of actors grow up together I'd watch Harry Potter. Those films are far superior and actually have characters interesting enough for me to want to follow and invest in them."
BOYHOOD,13 January 2019,10/10,"Richard linklater does something with time. With Before trilogy, He makes moments timeless. And with this, he makes us realise how fast time flies by. And what is life. It's a simple story about a boy till he turns 18: so the title. Richard's films doesn't aim to offer entertainment, but to show reality and a little magic. Boyhood tells you to not worry about life's purpose. The childhood moments are soo relateable!
I just loved it. I even cried the morning after I watched it. It made me think of my own life differently. Thank you for making this movie!"
BOYHOOD,13 January 2019,10/10,"People qho give low ratings think that there is no content. Nothing is happening in the film. There is no build-up, no conflict.
But that's the point. It's not meant to be like that. Otherwise it would be another commercial film; A guy with a problem to solve. Or a guy wanting something and getting it/not getting it.This film takes you on an experience of growing up. What changes occur during that time. How do kids react to parents at teenage. How changing father and homes affects them. How they think about life. How one usually grows in high school. If one is able to grow up and handle their own life? That's the content! It's a film about growing up.If you still think there's no content in the film. I can't argue. These are just my thoughts and I am happy to think it has content. You might have a different taste in films, go find another film."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,6/10,"I just got home from spending good money and time to watch this stinker. I truly don't understand any rating above a 6. I can handle no plot, but no character development or learning along the way or some revelation or commentary about life other than the moronic one at the end? Please don't waste my hopes for something good. Also, as a man who works his tail off to support his family and allow his wife to stay home to raise kids that say ""thank you"" as opposed to the knuckleheads in the movie, I found it appalling that every significant man in the movie other than the photography teacher was an arrogant pontificating loser and half of them were abusive drinks. What was the point of this? I wanted to throw up every moment Ethan Hawke was on screen. His meaning of life speech was pathetic and I can't understand the reason for putting it in the movie other than to re-enforce what self- aggrandizing asses men are. Why go through all the trouble to make this movie and sucker people in to watch a big ""So What?"" If you go to movies to be inspired, emotionally moved or presented with another viewpoint to ponder, you probably won't like this movie. Sorry, I just don't get this movie. I rated it a 6 because it is not terrible just really mediocre, including the acting. To bad the director was stuck with actors who got worse over years, not better."
BOYHOOD,26 December 2020,1/10,"This movie was beyond boring. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen..but nothing did. It was so boring and it was so long. This movie had such great ratings and such great reviews, I thought for sure it was going to be awesome. It was not. I wish I had the three hours of my life back. What a waste of time watching this movie. My life story was more exciting this plie of garbage. People really need to stop giving high ratings to undeserving movies. If you want something to help you sleep, watch this."
BOYHOOD,23 September 2021,3/10,"I empathise with the 1 star reviewers because this was a non eventful 2.75 hours.Twelve long years of filming produced a very sedate offering. Imagine a soap opera centred around a woman and her two kids, failed marriages, and career focused cliché narrative. Then imagine 12 years of this soap opera trimmed down to just under 3 hours but with all the whys and hows removed so you are just left with one great big what.The critics who celebrate this movie seem unable to get over the long term nature of the movie project and think that 12 years of filming can make up for no plot and a boring story."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2016,7/10,"""Boyhood"" was hailed as the cinematic event of the year – a classic American coming of age story, shot throughout a decade, in the hope of creating the most accurate representation of growing up there has ever been.Let me start by saying: Yes! Its technical achievement is impressive. You feel the characters age on screen and how the relationships change and evolve - or don't. Whether the film would be getting as much praise were it not filmed over a 12 year span I don't know. The fact is the achievement in itself is impressive, but the film is far from perfect. Linklater seems to rely a bit too much on his unique technical stunt and, while there's drama in ""Boyhood"", the film feels somewhat aimless in its direction. This needn't be a particular problem, but when you're sitting in a theatre for almost 3 hours, it can become a bit frustrating. Of course, the aimless and arbitrary nature of life seem to be one of the main themes and goals of ""Boyhood"", seeing as a lot of the praise it got was due to Linklater's skill in portraying life as it truly is. Most critics, and people who appreciate the film, justify it by saying ""Look! That's how life is."" Well, thankfully, my life wasn't like that. There wasn't any domestic violence in my home, but the scenes that bothered me the most were the long winded speeches where other characters preached and enlightened the young Mason. I never found my life or personality to be defined by that one or two moments of revelation. You struggle every day, making your own choices. Sometimes you make the right one, but most of the time you make the wrong. But, if you're really lucky, when you make the wrong one, you learn - you grow up. By having these very key and definite moments of change the film felt heavy handed and, even worse than that, it felt fake.The fact that I cannot relate as easily with the film as others is probably one of the reasons I did not adore it. I liked it. I thought most of the performances were quite good (particularly Patricia Arquette) and I was engaged throughout most of it. Yet my expectations were so high that I just couldn't help, but feel somehow let down by the end of it. ""Boyhood"" might not be the best film of the year, but it's still impressive and it definitely warrants your attention."
BOYHOOD,19 August 2014,10/10,"Director Richard Linklater worked on ""Boyhood"" over the course of 12 years, shooting intermittently bit by bit each year the same boy until he grew into adulthood. It is a work of tremendous patience, labour and love. The film is shot in a very direct manner, in which you are basically a voyeur of this young boy's perspective as he gradually learns life and his confused thoughts on what that all means. Linklater manages to be detailed without being overly ponderous and accurate without being drawn out. The pacing is so well done that even though the film is a little shy of three hours you won't even notice the time passing. Take the story as it is and let it unfold to you and you will be rewarded greatly by a story that contains both heart and substance. ""Boyhood"" is a peak into the human soul, littered with life lessons and universal truisms that apply to all humans without ever being preachy or dogmatic. It offers a lens to self-reflect on your own childhood and thoughts on life as well as others in this shared and interdependent world. Go into this movie with an empathetic heart and an open mind and I guarantee that you will experience something as magical as a giant mammals that lives deep under the ocean with massive hearts the size of cars you can swim through. Unfortunately, the one drawback is that there are technically no elves in this film (You'll understand after you watch it). This was perhaps the most honest film I've seen so far this year; and I will probably need some more time to soak all of it in, but this might be Linklater's magnum opus."
BOYHOOD,24 September 2014,10/10,"Okay. I admit, I looked at my iPhone to check the time, more than once. I will also confess that it took me awhile to become really involved with what seemed to be a rather mundane fly-on-the-wall peak at a single mother (Patricia Arquette) and her two kids. Dad's absent. We don't know where he is What else is new? Flash forward a year or two. No voice-over or ""2 Years Later"" on the screen to lead the audience by the nose. First reaction: ""Whoa, what amazing casting! Those kids are older, and yet look exactly like they would have a couple-a years down the line. Maybe they found two sets of acting sibs to play the kids as they age"" Arquette, too, was aging.This happens several times. And, by now, I'm wondering what the trick is. Arquette is going through a pair of marriages to abusive drunks, while moving ahead with her higher education. The kids are growing up, weathering their own traumas, bad decisions, and experimenting with more hair styles. Dad's back in the picture (every other weekend), in the form of longtime Richard Linklater collaborator, the contemplative, affable Ethan Hawk.When I finally sneaked a look at IMDb on my iPhone, the running time of 2:45 made me wonder. We were already 90 minutes in and, while the years were flying by on the screen, the minutes were crawling in the cheap seats. Wondering who this new ""Phoenix family"" was that provided so many fine young actors in the title role, I could find but one credit for the role of Mason — a 20-yr-old named Ellar Coltrane. Trivia in Coltrane's bio said that Ellar grew 27 inches and had 72 haircuts over the course of making this film.Holy Moses! A scripted, narrative film that actually waited for the cast to age before continuing on with the 12-year journey through Mason's boyhood. Imagine the commitment, the vision, not to mention the the risk involved in making what is surely an indie epic. How does one adequately laud this achievement? I've very much enjoyed and admired much of Linklater's work. Most recently, BERNIE, part doc, part scripted, a darkly hilarious slice of the small-town Texas the director knows so well. Prior to that, SCHOOL OF ROCK, another Jack Black collaboration. And, so very different, yet still bearing the naturalistic Linklater stamp, BEFORE SUNRISE.I can only hope that the Motion Picture Academy recognizes this feat for what it is: courageous, artistic, uncompromising film making. Richard Linklater deserves an Oscar. Come on!"
BOYHOOD,8 June 2014,3/10,"Every experience is personal and subjective. The film experience of Boyhood was extremely disappointing for me after waiting in a street long queue in the heart of Sydney city. While I appreciate the courage to make a film over the period of twelve years, I felt like I was sitting in the cinema for twenty years. Repeated philosophical jargon and a character who had no clue about what he wanted did not do it for me. Above all, what made me detached from the film was my own inability to connect with most of the characters. They all seemed happy and satisfied with their life even during the times of trouble. The story itself seemed too passive as a result of an easy childhood of the main character. There was nothing special about him that made me care about his story. All I felt while watching a film was that I was watching a documentary about ""How hard it was to grow in America in the beginning of twenty-first century."" It was not. In my opinion, this is a film that was made just for the native English speakers who were born and brought up in a developed country. I could see that others at the cinema were enjoying the film very much from the loud laughters and the applause that followed the end credits. This can arise another doubt that aren't there many films made just for a small community? Indeed there are. So the fault is probably in my decision to spend three hours for this film."
BOYHOOD,26 October 2014,6/10,"At first glance Boyhood appears to be a very unique film. A film shot over 12 years. A new sequence every year was filmed over 45 days in total, nothing like this had been done before in cinema history. It had the potential to not only be an interesting film but also a brilliant look at growing up in the modern age. As is made clear by the character of Mason near the end of the film, life is a series of moments; this way of thinking is clearly how the director wanted this narrative to be shown. It plays off like a series of short films, each sequence is its own entity however linked through the passing of time. This leads me to one of my major issues with the narrative; the filmmakers chose a generic life story filled with all the trials and tribulations of a bad soap opera. It is understandable why they did this, in an attempt to make it more relatable. However it backfires into looking like nothing more than lazy writing. As the narrative progressed into the third act, the repetitiveness of the story began to become very evident. It felt almost as though the filmmakers themselves weren't sure how to end it, yet the conclusion itself was ultimately satisfying. The clever use of music and news stories in the background of the film helped to define the time it was shot. This is something that will define it more as time moves on, creating an incredibly nostalgic piece. In terms of acting, it ranged from good to questionable. Ellar Coltrane did a superb job portraying the thoughts and feelings, wonder and angst, highs and lows for childhood. However to no fault of his own, the script made the character at times nothing more than an archetype to send preachy messages to the audience. I felt as though I was being beaten over the head at times with this, subtly was evidently thrown straight out of the window here. Lorelei Linklater was fine as Samantha, yet quite forgettable. The scenes where she was on her own, some of the worst in the film. Ethan Hawke was excellent as the distant but loving father. Strangely enough I felt most connection to his character than any other. The rest of the cast as said before served their purpose, no stand outs however. Boyhood is a film I may return to one day, perhaps in many years' time I will learn to love this as so many others do now. Yet for this time being it remains an impressive piece, interesting for the fact it was filmed over such a long period of time. But taking that away from it, the film has nothing spectacular to show."
BOYHOOD,26 July 2014,7/10,"Writer/Director, Richard Linklater, again applies his artistic style of keeping every scene real to every day life, with plenty of real humor, real feelings, real drama mixed in, allowing you to attach yourself to the experience of watching this film unlike no other, entertained NO LESS, as any level of tears and laughter you experience will prove that. It leaves you with plenty to think about, as the dialog itself is styled in the director's trademark of providing the characters engaged in insightful or philosophical topics --this brings about the experience of walking out of his movies drawing your own conclusions. As to how much enrichment you wish to take from Linklater's movies, it's up to you -- but no doubt, you WILL feel and you WILL take something --- hence, the beauty of his films.Best compliment: As long as this movie is, at 2 hours 45 minutes, it could have been even longer and Richard Linklater's movies will still keep you interested. Worst thing to say about it: It's a movie that shows the process of growing up, sure, but chosen from a viewpoint of a family struggling with very specific issues, as if that is the ""typical"" presentation of a family, I don't think so. But perhaps if a more common family had been chosen, that doesn't have alcohol, drugs and divorce issues to contend with, the mass movie goers might find that boring to watch, I don't know? The stand-out brilliance of this film is it's pioneering approach of 12-years of filming a single movie! Amazing. And great to watch, just for that alone.The performances of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette (playing the role of the parents) are excellent. These two steal every scene, and award worthy for ANY award-giving institutions out there --including Oscar. The main character of Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, with a project like this, could have had the production team faced with an older actor later on who might not have had the talent to act as a teenager (little could they be sure of this at the start of such a lengthy project) but he can act. His performance actually improves with age --leaving you liking the character even more by the end of the film. All I can ask is what original work do you have planned next, Linklater? Because, like your Before Sunrise series, A Scanner Darkly and other one-of-a-kind original movies, I very much look forward to your next project. I sense a lifetime achievement award for this director's film making. Those filmmakers of the likes of Woody Allen have NOTHING on this guy."
BOYHOOD,19 July 2014,9/10,"Linklater is certainly one of the most talented working directors today, and likely the most creative too. His latest film, Boyhood, may not quite attain the levels of Before Sunrise (or whichever ""Before"" film is most preferred by the given viewer), but it is an incredible work of art, soaring high above the now-quasi-traditionalist modern indie cinema.Boyhood is not the first film of its kind. The Seven Up series follows kids in a documentary style and a new film is produced every seven years with an update on their lives. Francois Truffaut has accomplished a similar effect to Linklater in his Antonie Doidel series. There are surely examples of other films, with the majority of them likely experimental in nature, that have similar filming styles as Boyhood. But where Linklater's creativity lies is not in how Boyhood is constructed necessarily; the ""gimmick"" of the 12 year filming only aids to the film by giving it the necessary dramatic growth. There have been multiple ""indie"" film movements over the history of cinema; neorealism and the French New Wave may even be classified as ""indie"" for their desire to break through political or artistic barriers respectively. The current indie movement, however, attempts to have a somewhat more shallow purpose, that is, to simply make un-Hollywood films. However, this limits the films themselves, as this promotes the same mundane formula that Hollywood does, despite having a different audience and end goal.This is where Boyhood transcends the indie drama and, to a lesser extent, all indie films before it and possibly after it. Constant placement of raw, real, dramatic scenes in traditional indie flicks seem to mimic typical Oscar bait scenes pumped out during the latter part of the year, and while Boyhood does have drama, it is very toned down. To assume that Linklater's placement of subdued drama is an attempt to mask the real world is entirely nonsensical; in fact, Boyhood feels more real than nearly every other movie, without even attempting to truly ""be"" overly-realistic.Linklater has attempted to create a film of feeling, a feeling that is ever-so-common today but ever-so-rarely filmed. In many films today, about pseudo-conventional, white, middle-class Americans, their tragedies in life are given almost astrological significance within the confines of the film (Silver Linings Playbook, as an example).There are some other films, particularly Margaret, which use other factors (shots of the city, with the characters as a microcosm for society) to give importance to the message. Boyhood is different; Boyhood captures the melancholy feelings that many people of the current generation are likely to identify with. Some bad things happen, some not so bad, but really nothing all that life-threatening. The lead character is a bit of a cynic, convinced he has the world figured out - or he is en route due to his nearly-objectivist attitude - yet is clueless about the future, placing an emphasis on the present.Perhaps this is how Linklater felt while filming Boyhood; the style changes over the course of the film, from pop-culture touchstones to more focused inter-personal relationships. Just as the characters mature, so does Linklater, fine-tuning his detour away from the populist indie movement which he nearly helped define. Have we found our new, American Jean-Luc Godard? Is Boyhood to Dazed and Confused as Weekend is to Breathless? Only time will tell."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,4/10,"Rating Based on Criteria:Sound: 1/2 The soundtrack reminds us which alternative rock songs were popular over the last decade.Acting/Characterization: 0.5/2 The children grow up to be bad actors, while the adults give decent impressions of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette.Script/Writing: 0/2 The script captures what life would be like if you were surrounded by dull people and reality was a few borrowed milestones from your favorite after school specials. Visuals: 1/2 Occasionally, the characters commune with nature and the scenery is pretty.Concept/Plot/Theme(s): 1/2 A filmmaker receives overwhelming praise for devoting 12 years of his life to a thoroughly disengaged and uninteresting character. He earns a point from me for completely bamboozling his audience. Total: 3.5/10Rating Based on Gut Feeling: 4/10 This is a coming-of-age story in which no one on screen really matures and the audience ages considerably watching them.Final Average Score: 3.75/10"
BOYHOOD,24 July 2014,9/10,"BOYHOOD In cinema it is rare to see the word gimmick used in any complementary phrase. It's usually more like ""That guy doesn't know how to tell a story, he had to use gimmicks to get it done."" Well, director Richard Linklater likes gimmicks. In his first feature ""Slackers"" he creates the illusion of continuous action to tell his story of Austin Texas oddballs. As one character moves off screen, a character from the background moves into the foreground and that character takes over the movie for the next ten minutes or so and then the process is repeated for the next character and so on, so that it appears as there is no break of time. It netted Linklater considerable critical praise and a nice chunk of pocket change to boot. Lesson learned: gimmicks can work.In ""Boyhood"", Linklater gives us a family saga that spans 12 years. There is the father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) the mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette} the two kids Mason Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) and his older sister Samantha (Lorilei Linklater who I believe is the director's daughter). The gimmick here (if it can truly be called a gimmick, and I think I would argue that it isn't) is that the same actors are used to portray the respective characters for the entire twelve years. Not a particularly big deal for the adults, but the kids-- in Mason Jr. case he must age from 6 to 18. How do you do that? Especially, if you intend to chronicle each and every year? Well, in order to keep continuity and maintain audience credulity you would have to wait for the kids to grow into their parts and as a consequence the movie would take twelve years to produce. And that's what Linklater did. Gimmick? Creative Choice? Dramatic device? Whatever, it is interesting don't you think?The film is set in Texas and opens with the family already in some disarray, Olivia and Mason Sr. are divorced, and Olivia is trying to make it as a single mother with a crappy job trying desperately to make it all work. Not surprisingly she's frazzled and just about on her last nerve. Mason Sr. does finally show up, apparently he's been in Alaska, and now wants to reconnect with his children. It's all too much for Olivia, so she decides to move to Houston with the kids, to be near her mother and start this all over again.So we have a ne'er-do-well father and a stressed out mother. Typically, Hollywood would take this to dysfunction and maybe even to depravity, but not Linklater. No, the refreshing theme of this movie is that despite the ever changing circumstances, the family, all of them, are steadfastly determined to stay functional as a family, and as individuals. This is a story of people, human beings, trying to make the best play of the cards they were dealt. We see all of this through the eyes of Mason Jr., an observer, and a stoic. He never has to doubt the love and commitment of his parents even if their ability to provide is limited. He seems to carry with him a since of duty to the family himself. That duty is to grow up, hopefully into a decent human being, with a full realization he's going to have figure out a lot of things for himself.I can't say too much about the acting individually except give it the highest compliment I can, which is in every case (even the supporting players) it's believable, empathetic and relatable. And it has to be. It is the only way to hold the attention of the viewer for the two hour and forty minute length of the movie. There has to be a moment or moments where the viewer (as I did) can look up at the screen and say to oneself ""Oh yeah, I know exactly what that's all about.""Much has been made of the 12 year production of this movie, perhaps even overshadowing the movie itself, but I don't think any of that should make any difference to the viewer. What the viewer is concerned with is what happens within the four corners of the screen. What Linklater has given us here is a rather large slice of life where it may at first glance appear that nothing remarkable or extraordinary happens, except that we watch a boy turn into a man firmly ingrained with the qualities of family, perseverance, duty, endurance, and a wealth of experiences which will make him as prepared as he can be for life's challenges. That's pretty remarkable."
BOYHOOD,10 November 2014,10/10,"If Boyhood isn't a true cinematic masterpiece, I don't know what is. It is poignantly moving, artistically stunning, and philosophically thought-provoking in terms of how we view our lives and experiences over the span of time. The fact that it was filmed with the same actors aging over the span of 12 years makes it that much more of an extraordinary viewing experience. Boyhood doesn't mean to be intrusive or overly dramatic in its presentation, but rather the details of growing up. It shows that we may consider trivial may have real meaning, and there is truly nothing like it. Richard Linklater captured my heart with the ""Before"" trilogy, and Boyhood has only furthered my adoration for his work. (for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)"
BOYHOOD,16 November 2014,9/10,"Simply put, BoyHood touches your soul and will be one of the best movies you'll ever see.I was a bit skeptical when I first heard of a movie that follows the same actor as he gets older. What makes that unique when compared to watching the kids of Harry Potter or Zach Morris grow up on the big or little screen? It's cool the director stuck to his plans over a 12 year period  but really  is it worth the hype?Abso-freaking-lutely.Ellar Coltrane's character Mason was an outstanding young man to follow throughout the movie. There is a great power to seeing a kid grow up on the screen without the need for specialized make-up, CGI or casting similar-looking actors. And while it's fascinating to see Mason – and the other characters – naturally age before our eyes, the storyline is the engaging glue. You feel the hurt, the happiness, the awkwardness, the rage, the hope of life over 12 years. This is a genius and genuine movie that will find it's way into your life days, weeks and I'm sure years to come.While the movie is technically long it doesn't feel like 165 minutes (you'll soon learn my distain for movies that can't seem to master the art of editing). In fact, you'll wish this a franchise for us to follow Mason for the next 40 years. Go see it, buy it, talk about it  this is why we love going to the movies."
BOYHOOD,18 August 2019,10/10,"This movie does an incredible job of keeping the characters relatable and not feeling fake. There are a couple of cliches such as drunk ex husbands, and the emo son. But overall the story is simple and the film is beautiful"
BOYHOOD,22 October 2020,6/10,"Well done and good acting but really not interesting.
Facts of everyday life. Is that what you want to see in a movie? Look at yourself in a mirror then. I was not able to watch till the end. Boring! Boring!"
BOYHOOD,1 August 2015,10/10,"This movie is excellent from the beginning. Young boys childhood of his friends, he mother relationships which didn't go so well (Ordinary Europe family). Very good acting, lots of efforts in this movie, lots of emotions, drama, true life. This family just had a divorce, mother was young, but still she loved her kids and wished them all the best. As we see two of the men were drunk addicted men and didn't find any true connection with their non biological kids. The story is great, the acting is perfect. Patricia Arquette won an Oscar... She deserves that... So I don't understand these ""critics"" who say this movie is some parody... Guys please if you are adopted, If you are some rich daddies kids please don't do any critics in this movie , because you don't even realize what is the life... I'm very disappointed of these so called critics who say this movie is boring... Your life's are boring... You will never understand what real life is..."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,8/10,"'Boyhood' is a twelve year epic following Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his life from five years old to eighteen years old. Through Mason's years he is faced with the many hardships any normal boy growing up would go through. With help from his mother (Patricia Arquette), father (Ethan Hawke) and sister (Lorelei Linklater), Mason learns valuable life lesson for his future. 'Boyhood' writer and director, Richard Linklater is best known for his works on the 'Before Sunrise' series.I must say this is quite an amazing film. It is amazing how Linklater perfectly depicted like life of a boy growing up. From the innocence of young child, to the awkward teenage years, transcending into college as an adult, it is nothing short of fantastic. For Linklater to have made this film, twelve years in the making with the same actors really is something special. I think this is something a lot of people can appreciate and relate to while watching this film.Ellar Coltrane does a pretty well job throughout this movie. To be involved with one movie for twelve years is crazy, and it takes a lot to take on a role like that. Coltrane really did well and you could really see the improvements to his acting each year he grew. Patricia Arquette also did great in this film. Her role as a mother growing with her child, witnessing the milestones and going through hardships of her own really was touching. Ethan Hawke was back again to work with Linklater and I think when he was in this film he was great. There is a noticeable change in his character throughout the film and I really loved his character and what he became. Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter was also in this film and it was really interesting to see her go through the process of growing up along with Coltrane. I think she did a great job as well. There were some other minor performances in there as well that were done very well, overall great acting by everyone.One thing I particularly liked about this film was seeing all the crazes at the time the scenes were filmed. From Gameboy Advances SP's, to music that was in at that time I really enjoyed that aspect of the film and I believe audiences will too. It really made me think back to my childhood and growing up and made things really relatable for me. Going along with that, the score was alright, nothing special, but I did however like the soundtrack. The cinematography was pretty great, really pleasing to the eye. Along with these pros there were some cons to this film.The editing in this film was done pretty bad. There was hardly any indication of what age Mason had grown to unless it was briefly mentioned in the dialogue. This was really hard to follow because in some cases Mason would be doing certain acts and you would think he is a lot older, and then it is revealed that he is years younger. It is understandable that this would be a long movie, being filmed over a twelve year span, but I do think it was unnecessarily long. While I enjoyed most of the film and could put up with the two hours and forty-five minutes, there were people in the theater struggling to keep up and wanting it to end. 'Boyhood' is an interesting movie and some people will be fine with the two hours and forty- five minutes, but it could have been trimmed downOverall, 'Boyhood' really is a great film, and is it is pretty special. Just the fact that this film was filmed over a span of twelve years makes it special, but there was so much more. The way it depicts the growth of not only a boy, but mother and father as well is truly fantastic. There are lots of great morals to be learned from this movie. I do not quite know as of now if I can see this film becoming a classic, due to its limited release and I do not know if it will (or is deserving) of any Academy Award nominations. While 'Boyhood' is a great film, it is not for everyone and people need to understand that. I am giving 'Boyhood' and 8/10 stars, but given the option, I would have given it an 8.5/10 stars."
BOYHOOD,22 January 2015,9/10,"OK, I'll admit it. This may very well be the best movie of the year. I now understand all of its buzz and praise. When I first heard of this, I knew exactly what it was and what it could be. I just could never shake the feeling that it was severely overrated. Now that I have seen it, it is worth every ounce of praise it got. It was a masterpiece that only could have been pulled off by Richard Linklater himself. His cast was on point every step of the way.The progression from young child to young man, and the trials of life put on that person him were perfect. I'm sure everybody can relate to at least one if not multiple things Mason and his family went through. All around amazing movie for everyone."
BOYHOOD,17 February 2015,7/10,"Shooting a movie over 12 years with the same actors is quite an ambitious and interesting process and Richard Linklater quite succeeded in making the result at least consistent. That is, there is a cinematography consistency between the scenes (which has been shot several years apart!) and the editing is made so that the narration is rather limpid.However, it seems that Richard Linklater doesn't have more than this shooting-process to brad about, and it's like the story he wrote has the sole purpose of supporting this 12-years-shooting, and nothing more. It's 3 hours of the childhood and teenage years of some random American kid. I don't say this is inevitably bad, and to be fair I never found myself bored while watching the movie, even finding some moments particularly poetic. But that doesn't make a story. Random reality is not that beautiful.I still wait for a (to find an already existing?) movie where an actual story and this shooting trick are not mutually exclusive. There is plenty of movies where there is a younger version of the main character appearing in multiple flashbacks, for example. Shoot that over multiple years with the same actor and then I'll recognize how impressive that is. But using this trick to shoot a movie literally about a boy growing up? Man, that's cheating!I might have really disliked it if it wasn't for Ethan Hawke."
BOYHOOD,4 August 2014,10/10,"Wow. That's all I can think after having walked out of the theater after this. This is not only the best film I've seen in 2014 so far, but perhaps one of the Top 5 films I've seen in perhaps 5 years or more. I mean it's almost like you're not watching a feature film, but a documentary. You're literally watching a family grow and age right before your eyes. The film gently reveals the reward as well as struggles of being a child and growing into yourself; As well as showing in equal balance, the tribulations of being a parent. Here is a film that everyone can find a little piece of their own experiences in. In some cases like myself, more than a little piece. 'Boyhood' focuses primarily on Mason Jr (Coltrane). The story begins with Mason at 6 years old. He and his sister Samantha (Linklater) living with their newly divorced mother played by Patricia Arquette. Early on we witness her struggle being a single mom, trying to balance out going to school, working and keeping her children in line. Mason is some what of an adventurer and scoundrel early on. Hanging with much older kids, we see him spray painting bridges, skipping out on homework, and well....just being a young boy. Soon we meet Mason and Samantha's father played by Ethan Hawke. He has been away in Alaska working after the divorce, but comes back and promises the kids that he will be around much more soon. He seems to be a man child, not wanting to take too much responsibility and focusing on making it as a musician. However, we'll see an impressive character arc with him towards the end. The films is incredibly smooth in it's transitions of progressing our characters age. There's no title cards, no dramatic entrances that represent an unveiling; Just subtle, unannounced changes in the characters age and status of life. We see Mason developing into a kid focused on art, and living on the fringe. We also see his mother go through a string of bad relationships with abusive alcoholics. As well as his father wander in and out of the film making his weekend appearances that he's allotted. Ultimately, there isn't much of a traditional narrative; Rather the film is an intimate dissection of human life. In the tradition of all of Richard Linklater's films, these are characters that feel totally real, and you love being in their presence. Linklater is arguably the most humanistic of all American filmmakers, because he doesn't judge his characters. He loves every character he creates. And he portrays them with absolute honesty. And that's definitely the case here. Never has a fictional family on screen, felt so organic. There were so many moments that I had a huge smile on my face, as well as many times my eyes were gathering tears.I cannot applaud Linklater enough for the sheer difficulty of making a movie like this. The film was shot for 39 days over the span of 12 years. Meeting up with all of the actors whenever all of their schedules would allow, with a new addition to the script in hand. The conversations feel improvised a lot of the time, but Linklater has said almost all of it was scripted. Which is no doubt a testament to his extraordinary writing. All of performances are top notch as well, highlights being Arquette and Hawkes performances. They both have character arcs that they pull off wonderfully, and it's almost spooky to see them age and know where they were in that stage of their careers. And what a risk it is to cast a 6 year old boy who's never acted before, and having no idea what kind of man he'll grow to be. What if he grew into a terrible actor? Luckily, Ellar Coltrane grew into a stud, and has real confidence and subtle command over this role. This is the best film of 2014 by a mile, and I don't see anything else other than maybe 2 other prospects impressing me more. 'Boyhood' is a film accessible to everyone. It can be related to in so many ways. Whether it's being a young boy moving from city to city trying to make new friends; A woman struggling to raise her children while also gaining her education to make a better life. Maybe it's the magic of finding your first young love and then losing them. 'Boyhood' hits every note without missing a beat, and it will be a favorite of mine till the end of my days for sure. You owe it to yourself and to Richard Linklater to see this beautiful film."
BOYHOOD,18 February 2015,1/10,"What was ""Seinfeld"" about? NOTHING but it was so cleverly written and casted, it was classic. What was ""BOYHOOD"" about? Nothing and it was so stupidly written, so boring, so annoying...it was close to three hours of complete visual and acoustical torture. It's actually up for Oscars? The fix is in, folks. All it's about is a time sequence study of the same people for more than a decade. As they age, the movie gets lousier until one's bladder tells you the large container of soda is having a greater effect on you than is the picture hence the rest room becomes a part of an escape from the garbage being shown to a lot of suckers like me. No kidding, all this picture is worth is an extended visit to the throne room."
BOYHOOD,16 January 2015,7/10,"Yesterday my run to watch the nominees to the Academy Awards starts officially! I decided to see one of the most discussed film of this year: Boyhood. Richard Linklater and the cast have worked to this movie for 12 years: this is a big innovation in the silver screen. We don't see the succession of different actors to portray the development of a character in the time, or tricks to make the actors look younger or older. This dresses the movie of a untouchable trace of modern realism. And the realism, in my opinion, is the best weapon of this film: the creator choose of not showing a 12 year shocking tale, but simply a boy normal life. This can be appreciated or not, by makes this movie noteworthy objectively. And I think that the director deserves recognition at least. Regarding the cast I like very much Patricia Arquette, the most changed adult actress on the screen, playing a truthful character, active to fight for conciliate her life of women and mother. Another time I cannot say that I'm completely impressed by this movie, but I recognize that this is a big work by someone that have something to say and know how do his job."
BOYHOOD,27 February 2015,3/10,"How I imagine this movie came to be: Richard Linklater presented his script to some studio people and they said to him: Well, you wrote a nice story with every cliché in the book and painful to read dialogue. We like it, but we have like 50 of these piled up here already. So what's the difference? And Linklater thought for a few seconds and said: Well, I would like to make this movie incredibly hard to make and give it an pointless, yet somehow fascinating gimmick. Well, we all now about the gimmick and when you think to yourself, they filmed that years ago, that's kinda crazy. But ultimately it doesn't add anything to the movie, because in the end you could tell me they just casted some kids that look the part and put some make up on Ethan Hawke and you had the same movie filmed in thirty days instead of 12 years. And like I already said, the script has every cliché you could wish for. Divorced parents? Check. New father is a drunk alcoholic who beats his wife? Check? They have to move every week? Check. Bullies who hate on Mason for no reason whatsoever and are only seen once? Check. Camping with Dad? Check. Emo hair? Check. Rednecks? Check. Wants to be an artist and is of course talented, but lacks work ethics? Check. Well, I do realise that something has to happen in the movie and this is a coming-of-age movie (you might say it's more, but I don't see how), so there will be a love story of some kind and school troubles, but this movie just adds nothing new to it. Ultimately the scenario just isn't very interesting or engaging, because nothing interesting or engaging happens. You just see people living a relatively difficult life and grow up. It's just like Breaking Bad, if your ripped the cooking drugs part out of it and just showed the scenes where the family does something mundane. Doesn't sound great? Yeah, it isn't. You might say the story is realistic and I agree, the stuff in this movie could happen. But other than a documentary which would follow those people over a decade, you still know that there is a script and something will happen, but just because it needs to happen to keep the movie going and not because it is destiny or even just coincidence. Maybe that's the big problem with the movie, it wants to simulate life, but life has no script. You might also say I'm completely missing the point of the movie and it has some deeper meaning I'm just not seeing and maybe that is the case, but I think this movie is just unnecessary and bland. But there are also some parts of the movie I like: Ethan Hawke is great in it. Like I already said, the whole idea of filming this over more than a decade instead of using make up and different actors definitely is fascinating, despite being pointless in my eyes."
BOYHOOD,2 January 2020,10/10,In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made.
BOYHOOD,18 February 2019,6/10,"It's funny. As I was getting closer to the end I thought to myself ""This reminds of the Before Sunrise/Sunset movies."" and I look it up after the fact....same writer/director.
From what I've seen Richard isn't your typical storyteller. He's more of a character study type of creator. Problem is the final cut doesn't always equal a satisfying result.The concept is outstanding. Take the same cast and keep them on board for over a decade for the same movie. Tell the story of them growing up (and make no mistake about it. This movie is much more about the kids than the adults)Problem is...there's a lot of cliche's along the way. Some ideas feel thrown in because it feels like they should be. Some ideas seem recycled. Some things just don't add up.I enjoyed it for what it is because it's still a great concept. At the end of the day though it could have been a lot more.P.S. I would have said 7, but knock a full point down for force feeding the politics in. Using them to tell the story of a character is completely fair game but this was more just creator taking an excuse to establish timeline and using it preach instead."
BOYHOOD,27 July 2014,9/10,"To my mind, the title is an important part of a film and, whether we like it or think it suited the film or not, it says something about the lens the director sees the film as a whole through. So to say that it could just as easily have been called Motherhood or a number of other things, as some have suggested, imho misses the point that Linklater chose to call it Boyhood so part of what it means to thoughtfully consider and try to appreciate the film he made is to consider what the film says about boyhood. And this is what i come away with: Mason's boyhood was a wary one. From the time we first see him and his sister go off for a weekend with his long lost dad, we see an already somewhat jaundiced-eye, jaded 6-year-old not ready to throw himself into dad-adoration or even overt dad-longing. He has learned already to associate dad with abandonment and has rightly come to maintain a rather ambivalent or modulated trust, as if he's already learned to rein in expectations of others, especially adults and especially dad and, as the movie progresses and his life takes on stepdads and other male authority figures, we see a boyhood spent growing up in search of a male role model - compounded by seeing mom choose to bring two of the worst candidates into his life as stepdads. Mason comes out seeming resilient but boyhood nevertheless looks pretty fragile, pretty vulnerable to a chaotic mix of messages from adults who are seen to be as confused as (arguably more confused than) the kids. Samantha experiences the same mix of adult male figures but she's not seeking one to emulate as role model. And it's Mason as lead character whose eyes and needs we perceive the chaos through. And it's Mason (and by extension boyhood) that winds up getting a diversity of really messed-up images of what manhood is. And the older boys he deals with all operate on a basis of intimidation, taunting, goading, demeaning, threatening - and where have they presumably gotten those notions of 'manhood' from? The dots could hardly connect more vividly.Irony is that it turns out Mason's own dad - the first male in his life, who mom left cuz he was a 'loser', is the closest thing Mason's got - at least a dad he can actually question about life and be taken seriously, even if dad's insights about life may sometimes leave a lot to be desired (e.g., seeing women as opportunists wanting to ""trade up""). But one advice in particular from his dad seemed incontestable - and reflected Mason's own lived experience in observing how his mom interacted with the men in her life. Namely, in the balcony overlooking the band doing sound check near the film's end, after being bafflingly dumped, Mason hears his dad tell him to remember that only he holds the key to his own self-worth, to not let himself be defined by someone who has dumped him. It's the very lesson his mom took a long time learning at her children's and her expense, letting one authoritarian husband after another keep her own self-worth on a short leash and squeeze the oxygen out of her own and her children's home lives. So maybe that is the ultimate view of boyhood here: If one can escape it with an intact sense of self-worth (seemingly against all odds given the array of confused and/or corrupted adult 'guides'), maybe they can reach adulthood themselves, by mostly holding their own counsel, as Mason so deftly depicts turning inwardly to do, and essentially raising themselves to become the male role models they never quite had. But it seems pretty much of a crap shoot - look at the many boys he interacts with who show signs of having learned only to seek to control others and impose their misery through intimidation."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,2/10,"I didn't have high expectations for this film at all, other than the fact that it had Ethan Hawke in it with one of my favourite directors directing it. However, the film doesn't have the charm and wit of the ""Before"" films. It seems like the one who added them to the ""Before"" series was Julie Delphy after all. I was looking for a witty dialogue throughout the film and was utterly disappointed when the film came to an end without a single remarkable scene or dialogue. The film is visionary, yes because it took 12 years in the making. Yet, it is not anything extraordinary. Frankly, I think that instead of actors, if Linklater employed an ordinary family and recorded their lives without following a script would have been better. With this cast and the story, I didn't know what to make of it. All in all the film is most certainly visionary but nothing extraordinary! You won't be disappointed, if you missed the chance to watch it."
BOYHOOD,19 July 2016,10/10,"Boy Hood, directed by Richard Linklater, and staring Patricia Arquette, Ellar Coltrane, Lorelei Linklater, and Ethan Hawke, is the true very rare stand-alone work of cinema. Along with the director, who appears to have made virtually every right choice, these four actors deserve special mention, because of the dedication it took to make this film, one truly unlike anything that's ever be put to film. Filmed over 12 years, shooting a piece each year, telling the story of an evolving family unit, it could have been a mess, or it could have been just a novelty, but it ends up as a masterpiece.It's called ""Boy Hood"" but I'm not sure at the beginning of the project they knew that was actually going to be the title. It's starts as Coltrane's Mason is six years old, and we are introduced into a world that's multilayered rich, with his mother and sister Samantha (played by the director's own daughter) being equally important, and by the second year the father also comes in to be quite impactful. It's only as the years pass that Mason gradually solidifies himself as the main star. But as certain minor character come and go the core four, their evolution as people and their relations to one another, remain the core of the film.The four performances are terrific, we truly believe we see them grow and mature (the adults going through changes nearly as large as the kids) in part because in real life they actually do, in part because the script leads them along with particular moments and events of life that are allowed to develop, and finally in part to their absolute dedication; so they feel really authentic. We don't get clear cutoffs; the movie, rightly so, never tells the viewer ""12 months later"" or ""8 months later"", and we might slip into another year without immediately realizing, and that's completely fine—in fact it's better than fine, it's fantastic! The changes are brilliantly subtle, detailed without trying to hard, and there are pop culture, political, and other societal references that sort of guide us, but never lead us with a leash. There have been complaints from a small minority of there being no overarching plot, which really an overarching plot would have really destroyed what this movie so superbly executed. It's about life, the little moments that shape who one is, and some of the larger ones we remember forever. Everyone will be able to relate, and most people will quite a lot.There a few words that could have described my feeling upon finishing this two-hours-and-forty-five-minute film that doesn't, in my judgment, have a single scene that's unnecessary, nor any one I can think of it lacking. ""Brilliant"" feels both like it's not enough, and maybe a little presumptuous, at least for now. Given the way it separates itself, how will I feel about this movie in ten or twenty years I really can't say. But of its current standing to me I say firmly it's one of the great achievements of this century."
BOYHOOD,2 January 2015,10/10,"Wow. Just finished watching ""Boyhood""...truly extraordinary! Director Richard Linklater filmed this over the course of 12 years with the same core cast, allowing us to see the passage of time shown from a unique perspective.People either love or hate these type of films because ""nothing"" happens. (It's for the same reason I loved David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"") When seen through a deeper corridor of months, years or decades, we don't seem to recognize ourselves and think we've missed something. We think we've missed moments; in essence, the moments become us and we become them.Through the seizing of moments, we slowly gather glorious memories, we move and grow and change and become. Like moss on stone, these memories bring beauty, warm and substance to our lives and to others. I certainly wouldn't want to live any other way...I'll be ruminating on this film for some time to come... Two thumbs up from me! May you all be seized by moments!--------------- ""You know how everyone's always saying seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kind of thinking it's the other way around, you know, like the moment seizes us."" ~ Boyhood (2014)"
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,8/10,"Before I express my thoughts as to why I love this movie so much, let me get this out of the way: I understand the hate and/or disappointment it's getting. The single mom/son chemistry going on between the main character (Ellar Coltrane) and his mother (Patricia Arquette) is one that one can only fully appreciate if one has experienced it. That being said: I am a male raised by a single mom, and I can safely say this is one of my favourite movies of the year. Every subtle trope about growing up in a mother/son relationship (or growing up in general, for that matter) had us (me and my mother) everywhere from bursting in tears to laughing out loud. It's a movie that's guaranteed to please you if it's recognizable. What it does at least as good as making you recognize yourself in a lot of situations, is providing an interesting view in how your parent perceives things, and vice versa. At the same time, that's the main reason we liked it: it's recognizable. And that's where we can see how the shoe doesn't fit for a huge amount of people, a majority, even: if you don't belong to the specific audience this film was aimed at, it's very probable it does very little to nothing for you. I could go into detail about the plot, but it's easily summarized: it's 12 years in the life of a child/young adult, growing up with his mom and sister during the greater part of the movie. Which brings me to the second reason this movie got the attention it did: the plot element and/or gimmick where they actually filmed the movie for twelve years. Whereas it didn't form the basis for my attachment to the greatly-written characters, it did contribute a significant deal to it. That being said, there isn't a whole lot more I can say about it than that it makes you like the characters more and that it's obviously a novel idea that requires a load of devotion. Anyway, the verdict is that if you happen to be a son raised by a single mom or vice versa, this movie is a must-watch. I'd say it'd still be worth your while giving it a go if you aren't, but it definitely takes away from the experience - and then again, I couldn't possibly say for sure. If the concept of this movie doesn't sound like your cup of tea, though, don't bother watching it: it will not positively surprise you, as it does exactly what it says on the tin, even though it does it incredibly well in my opinion. My final verdict is a 9 out of 10 for the son/single mom combo, and a 7 for everyone else. That brings the average to an 8/10."
BOYHOOD,12 February 2015,,"This movie is completely, utterly, boring. There's literally nothing that happens. It's about a boy living an extremely dull and clichéd life. There's virtually no drama that happens throughout the entire movie, and the drama that is presented is still quite listless and unimportant. In other words, this movie is about as plot-less as a movie can get. It took twelve years to film, and yet, those years span by quickly and dully, one event after the other, with no point or order, just chaotic and random. But what makes the movie so dull was the main character.In the movie, there is nothing bad happens to the main character, nothing to make you connect with him. There's nothing life changing. In fact, the three biggest ""bad"" things that happen to him are that his mother can't find ""the right guy"" (after divorcing his father, she marries her college professor who turns out to become a drunk, and then she marries one of her own college students, who turns out to have mental stability problems due to him serving in the military; both of which she ends up divorcing as well), and his father sells the car that he had thought would be his when he turned sixteen, and his girlfriend cheated on him, which resulted in their relationship ending. Other than this, nothing happens. He literally goes through life showing as little emotion as possible, just floating by, as though he was in a coma, or constantly tired.So, finally, after two hours and thirty minutes, you come towards the end of the movie. The ""boy"" is now an adult who has graduated high school and who is going to be going to college. Upon him packing his last things, his mother breaks down saying that there's nothing more that is going to happen with her life. That her life has just been a series of events: her having her children, her divorcing her husband, her raising her children, her marrying a man, divorcing him, raising her kids some more, marring her college student just to divorce him as well, and finally, her sending first her daughter to college, and then her son. Then she concludes with saying that what comes next is, ""(her) funeral."" To this, the boy, replies that she's off by forty years, ""or something."" Then she says that, ""(she) expected there to be more."" The movie then cuts to him driving on the road to college.When he finally arrives at college, he meets his new roommate, who is friendly and invites him to go hiking with his girlfriend and another friend (who is also a girl). When Mason (the main character) sees that she's pretty, he decides that he'll go. Before he goes, his new roommate hands him a hallucinatory mushroom and says that by the time they reach the mountains, it will have an effect. It then fast forwards to them walking to the mountains and we see that Mason and the new girl are getting along very well. Then it cuts to them sitting and chatting. Across the distance, he sees his roommate yelling into the wind, and he begins to talk to this new girl, named Nicole, about how we need to, ""seize the moment."" Nicole replies with saying, ""I think moments seize us,"" and it shows Mason thinking for a moment, and then it cuts to the end credits.I think what bothered me the most about the film was the fact that, despite it having no order, there was a point, but it wasn't that great of one. Mason, who lived his entire boring life on coasting mode is finally forced to see that if he keeps doing this, he will end up like his mom––just living, but not truly alive in the sense of being satisfied with life. The point is that we need to let the moments seize us, and we need to live. Yet, what made this theme so irrelevant was the fact that there was hardly a moment for him to have ever seized! There was no bad, barely any good, nothing that would have made is life have any significant meaning. By the end of the movie, you ask yourself, ""Is my life really this boring?"" And do you know what my answer was? ""No, there's more drama in mine."" In conclusion, if you want to see a long movie that drags on and on about a boy just living his life, then you'll love this movie. Even though it had a theme presented at the end, in my opinion, it just wasn't enough to save the movie overall. It is sad really, because it was such an ambitious project. But by creating such a dull life where nothing happens, I feel that they wasted those twelve years, because in all actuality, most people's lives are far more chaotic and show signs of actual character development due to things that happen, both good and bad, in their lives. That's what this movie failed to do: deliver on experiences that are worth watching. What's left instead is dull, listlessness that fails to satisfy someone who wanted to be entertained. I wanted to see sadness, hopelessness, as well as extreme elation and happiness. To see someone grow into a great person despite and because of circumstances. What I got was boy coasting his entire life though a movie that has a run time far too long."
BOYHOOD,3 October 2014,10/10,"This film was amazing on many levels. And it's the levels in films that I really enjoy. There is watching and enjoying it on a surface level, but there's a deeper level below that surface through which I enjoyed this film. The realistic acting and scenes and the way they were strung together was like being a fly on the wall in someone else's life. But somehow it wasn't just about them, it was about you as well. It was about all of us and how this experience of life and the struggle between what we thought it would be like and what it really is is something we all share. But what made this film so beautifully brilliant was that it touched on what life could potentially be. Mason was a rare type of person who had the potential to become a self actualized person, and become everything he could possibly be and experience life on a deeper level than his mother or most other people. I think his father was the one who inspired this side of him, his creativity and his potential. Mason could see the beauty in moments, which he captured through photography. He also showed independent thinking at a young age and complained of the pressures he felt from society to conform or follow a certain set of steps. Which is what his mother ended up disappointed in. The ending of the film was perfect in my opinion because it gave a preview into what Mason's future would be like. On his first day of college he meets people who are into finding something more from life, into experiences. The end of the film shows Mason having a very deep experience and I think his future will be full of these moments. And there is nothing less I would wish for anyone. I know he is just a movie character but like I said, it made people think about their own lives and I hope it inspires people to find these unique experiences in life and really get the most out of the human experience rather than ending up crying someday wishing for more. There is more. You just have to find it. I cannot give this movie a rating lower than 10 because it was brilliant and beautiful on so many levels and spoke on behalf of the human experience more than any other film ever has."
BOYHOOD,9 June 2021,2/10,"Actors? Just actors! The movie although trying to have some logic, is very sloppy and actors help it flow. But that doesn't mean you could build a good school with it teaching to have a movie that even nearly tells you something. Most of the movie is filled with garbage lines and there is no way to have the philosophies ""thaught"" in this movie to have any good life experience. The movie is full of stereotypes. I would tell no love has been put into this movie, nothing serious but also boring..."
BOYHOOD,9 December 2016,10/10,"Boyhood was called by some Richard Linklater's masterpiece. I tend to agree with that assessment. Linklater is an odd director in Hollywood meaning he does make some very experimental movies (Boyhood, the Before series) but he also does formulaic films, such as School of Rock, a movie that could've been absolute trash but Linklater made into a really enjoyable film. Well, that being said this is a VERY experimental film that needed a hell of a lot of finesse in filmmaking to make. Editing had to be one terribly difficult thing to do with this movie, as they had to seamlessly put together a story that takes place over twelve years using different looking actors for all twelve years of it. The direction had to be perfect as well for this movie to work and Linklater made it work. He had to give the editor something of a story that he had to film differently every year. OK this is getting kind of ranty, but this is a difficult movie to talk about without getting a little ranty because everything is to be great in order for this movie to work. Every single piece in the puzzle that was Boyhood had to fit together seamlessly for this movie to work, and it works. Those are some of the positives of the movie. Some of the others are the fact that this movie wasn't going for a story that's going to make you say ""Wow that was crazy cool!"" They were going for ""Wow this could have actually been someone's real life story."" While watching it it had a strangely eerie likeness to real life. Everything in the movie could have happened in real life, and probably has happened in real life to someone. That is where the movie really succeeds greatly. It is also where many people have drawn criticism to it. Saying it is boring is ridiculous. It's trying to be boring! It's trying to real life! It's not an escapist movie and if people didn't understand that then gave it bad reviews then they are dumb. The one criticism I have for this movie is that at the beginning of the movie some of the young performers suffered from the general curse upon child actors. Specifically Lorelai Linklater's performance during the first two years were slightly annoying but after those two years I literally didn't see a flaw in this movie. Fantastic. Probably should have won best picture, but that's a different argument. (10/10)"
BOYHOOD,7 March 2015,9/10,"I am sick and tired of Hollywood's inaccuracies in the films they produce. From Amistad's horrendous lies about its stories of slavery to Tyler Perry making me believe that he is an actual elderly black woman, Hollywood keeps pooping out new flicks that focus entirely on the entertainment and not at all on the facts. And it's safe to say that Boyhood was the worst of all. This movie made me so livid that I wanted to cut my freaking cat's ear off! The film portrayed a boy as he grew from five to seventeen years old in front of the audience's eyes. He lived in a mostly happy household with only a few minor obstacles, but nothing too severe that the family couldn't handle it. (Except that one part. The people who have viewed the film will know what part I mean.) Boyhood did not represent childhood in a realistic way, and it especially did not represent my childhood.I was born in a small town in Nebraska on the dance floor of a strip club off the interstate where my mom happened to be dancing that night. Many people took their dollars back off the stage the moment I popped out. I emerged from my mother's uterus with a feeling of ambition. A feeling that I could take the world by storm.However, my father, a flight attendant, had other plans for me. Once I got my basic motor movements down, he had me training to be ""just like your old man"" as he put it. Pops made me train for hours on end, serving drinks and peanuts to family friends and relatives while always keeping a phony smile on my face. By the age of three, I knew the safety procedure speech like the back of my hand. And keep in mind, this was before I even knew the alphabet. Or my own name.All I ever wanted to do was juggle for a living. I once told him about my desire to attend juggling camp for a week over the summer. He replied by saying ""I bet you'd like to handle all those balls, wouldn't you? Stick to flight attending, son. It's a man's job."" I was devastated. The idea of being able to keep more than one ball in the air at a time mesmerized me for years to come. But I could never make my dreams known for fear of what my father might do.Once I graduated from high school, my dad pulled some strings and got me a job as a flight attendant at the nearest airport. He had retired at this point; he said he did it because ""9/11 really sucked balls."" He was so excited that I was following (or should I say flying!) in his footsteps. But the day I was supposed to start the job, I did not make it to the airport, for I was on my way to follow my dreams.I hit the open road, looking for the nearest juggling college. The existential feeling of bliss that I felt from the freedom of being out of my father's control was more than I had ever felt before. But it quickly diminished, for I learned that there is no such thing as juggling college. Amateur mistake, Blake. Amateur mistake.I ran out of money fast, having spent it all on an expensive juggling set I had planned on showing off to all the other kids at juggling college so that I could be one of the cool kids. I hooked for a little bit, but no one would take my body. I have a bad hunching problem and a massive rash on my back, so it kind of looks like molten lava rushing down the side of a volcano when I take my shirt off. I had nowhere to go. No one to turn to. For many a days, I ate garbage from a dumpster behind Burger King, which I know sounds redundant since their food is already garbage. I got food poisoning thrice over the course of a year. Reluctantly, I knew what I had to do. I tucked my tail in between my legs and made the long journey home back to my parents. I knocked on the door and asked my dad for forgiveness.""NO SON OF MINE WILL BE A JUGGLER! NOT ON MY WATCH!"" he yelled.""But, Dad!"" I pleaded. ""You are forever shunned from this household,"" he said with an icy look. Then, he slammed the door in my weary face. I am still homeless. I have no money and nowhere to go. I recently beat a man with one of my expensive juggling pins in a fight over a box of Raisin Bran. It's brutal out there, let me tell you. I figured out this family was going on vacation for a couple weeks, so I am currently squatting in their home. I came to see Boyhood because I rented it on their credit card, and I am also stealing their Internet to write this review.I just needed to get my thoughts on how unrealistic Boyhood was out in the open because I checked, and I didn't see anyone else complaining about this. I mean, c'mon Hollywood. Where was the part about flight attendants? Where were the parts about the boy's love for juggling and his dad's denial of any pursuit of the boy's dreams? Huh????? Because, tell me if I'm wrong, but I didn't catch those parts. It really baffles me how well you Hollywood bigwigs botched this great idea for a movie. Call me when you make a good movie for once. I'm done with this BS.P.S. Don't call me because I don't own a phone. Because I'm homeless. Because my dad shunned me for my love of juggling.Sincerely, Your fellow IMDb user blakelogsdon1"
BOYHOOD,18 April 2017,10/10,"I've seen many movies in my life, some of them masterful and thoroughly impressive, others less appealing, but none could have prepared me for the unique experience of watching ""Boyhood"" by Richard Linklater. Having seen it, I felt utterly overwhelmed by a torrent of emotions: deep affection for having witnessed so much beauty, sadness that the experience is irrevocably over, a deeper melancholy about the sorrows and hardships that life has in store for everyone, weirdly also lightness and elation. If a movie manages to hit you emotionally from so many different directions, evoking opposite feelings while leaving you in a profound state of reflection, it must be great (and of course I am aware that ""great"" is too small a word here). The most dazzling quality of ""Boyhood"" is its naturalness. The viewer is privy to witness the boy Mason (Ellar Coltrane) grow up to become a timid teenager and from there to see him evolve into a stunningly handsome, reflective and creative young man who has his bit of wisdom to share with all of us. 12 years of bittersweet development, of building up connections and breaking them off, of memorable scenes and unconscious day-to-day routine, of shaping the relationships with the most important persons in your life, these 12 years are fabulously captured in about 160 minutes.In the beginning, it may be irritating to some viewers that nothing ""big"" is happening: no great drama is staged, not the usual sex & violence-crime-story we have grown accustomed to being fed. It shows how Hollywood has shaped our viewing expectations, how we are used to consume clichés and stereotypes. Director Richard Linklater lifts us out of this false film universe and rewards us with real life, compressed ad fast-forwarded. However, that does not mean that the movie feels in any way rushed. We still have enough time to get to know Mason and the people dearest to him; his mother (Patricia Arquette) who undergoes a dramatic transformation from housewife to independent psychology lecturer, his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) who has a certain waywardness about her that we also find in Mason and his flippant but affectionate father (Ethan Hawke). The fact that this movie was shot at certain periods over a 12-year- stretch singles it out from all other cinematic attempts at capturing a longer personal development in a 2-3 hour film. This boy Mason is real and when he's a teenager and later a young adult, it's still the same actor and not just someone who resembles the other actor. The 2017 Academy Award winner for Best Movie, ""Moonlight"" tried something similar in portraying the life of a black homosexual from a poor family at the three stages of boyhood, being a teenager and adulthood. Yet, no matter how much the movie was ""on message"", the actors playing the main character Chiron didn't even look alike. Thus, the whole movie didn't feel right. Here, we don't have that problem. All of it feels smooth and natural, which makes it virtually impossible not to empathize with Mason when he encounters the first bumps in his young life, when he suffers under the regime of alcoholic, bad-tempered stepfathers, when he is impeded by self-consciousness and shyness as a teenager, when he asks the big questions as a young adult and desperately seeks answers that provide him with a compass for life. All these experiences are universal, everyone has made them one way or the other and we know that they don't come with cheesy dialog lines out of a 19th century drama.What Linklater had in mind when he embarked on a project of such magnitude that demanded extraordinary discipline and a lot of time, was to capture life in its purest form. This clarity in his ambition pays off multi fold as it allows us to focus entirely on the characters and not be distracted by the often irksome question of which message the director wants to convey with this and that. Moreover, this astonishing film about existence surpasses the existentialist reductionism that many find expressed at its best in Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot"": there the characters are engulfed in an existence beyond hope, spending their days waiting for someone who never comes. There's a whole array of movies out that transport the same existentialist loneliness and disillusionment (take ""Kids"" or ""Ken Park"") and leave the viewers with a feeling of gloom. By contrast, ""Boyhood"" ends on a decidedly hopeful chord – there is change (for the better) all around us, we just need to allow ourselves to give in to the moment."
BOYHOOD,18 December 2015,,"There he is. We look upon Mason's six year old, prepubescent face. Of course we know this is the beginning of a fictitious story, gradually this face will be shaped and matured, not from prosthetic makeup but from an element that is so often misused in cinema, time itself. Mason lays there looking up at the sky, his mind already taking shape. This is just one, mundane moment in this young kids life but then, that's just what Linklater's Boyhood is all about, life in every sense of the word. A series of moments in the vastness of time, no real beginning and no real ending.Essentially an experimental work in a fictional narrative, Richard Linklater's Boyhood is rooted from his experiences as a father himself. By shooting the film periodically for twelve years, he wanted to capture a divorced mother and father raising their young son and daughter, while letting the unexpected events in each individuals life keep the film moving along. Many people criticize boyhood for lacking any real ""story"" or purpose but isn't this something that works in the movie's favor?Linklater's maturation as a filmmaker lends the film much needed restraint, with a low-key, laid back aesthetic (a style he uses frequently), he shows much confidence in his process for such an ambitious film. As we move along, the characters are shown to remarry, have additional children or just keep growing older. Mason's father seems to have outgrown his days as a music loving drifter to a minivan driving husband and father. His mother keeps getting involved in hallow relationships with other men, she seems wed to an idealized future that she has never had. Patricia Arquette is great playing the role of a single mom who at times suffers from abuse and disillusionment. Maybe none of the characters get what they thought they were going to get from life but if you take the good times with the bad, it's worth every second and you get the sense that Mason, his mother, his father and sister wouldn't have it any other way.Of course, some modern audiences are likely to dismiss Boyhood. In an age of hyper-aesthetics and tent pole franchises, American cinema has primarily established itself as an action oriented media over the past few decades but Boyhood is a different breed. Linklater draws his influence from the quieter voices of classic European cinema (Bresson, Rohmer, Dreyer; etc), something that separates him from modern directors. He handles his characters with a gentle touch and doesn't overuse an ounce of sentimentality. Perhaps the film also does work best if one is familiar with Linklater's other ""walk and talk"" films (the Sunset trilogy, Slacker), the style can be abrasive at first and almost irk you with the constant philosophical monologues but this is not just pretentious rambling. While viewing the films in tandem, the characters in these films seem to represent something much bigger than themselves.10/10. With his latest achievement, Richard Linklater has perhaps transcended the boundaries of cinema. Today's filmmakers have a lot of catching up to do."
BOYHOOD,11 September 2018,7/10,"Anyone who has seen any work from Richard Linklater knows what kind of a filmmaker he is. He waited between years to complete his ""Before"" trilogy and with Boyhood he has gone a step further and actually filmed the actor in real time. The real time extent here is a staggering 18 years and the coming of age aspect is enhanced by this fact alone. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play the parents of the lead and the young actors, especially Ellar Coltrane is exceptional. This is a must watch for all cinema lovers."
BOYHOOD,27 May 2019,7/10,Perhaps one of the most powerful movies the history of film. What sets this above all others is its ability to transcend the screen and bring the viewer into the life of mason.There is something for everyone in this movie.
BOYHOOD,25 July 2020,1/10,"This movie was recommended to me after watching the masterpiece that is ""Moonlight"". Was not worth it. Boring, just giving a little props for telling a realistic story but nothing remarkable happens. Bad choices were made, boo hoo. Everyone makes those in a while. The movie ended up being a waste of time. Over hyped."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,10/10,"Rarely, you would come across a movie that transcends countries, generations, cultures.A movie that is so inherently universal, has everyday emotions, a family like yours, well that is boyhood for you.Linklater has the knack of picking stories that are always around us. He not only writes,but creates a story like the before series.With boyhood, he set on a journey that would last for 12 years, a journey which no one in movie making has ever thought of.There are no characters in it, there is just a family with whom you spend these memorable 12 years. There is a boy who has friends, loves growing hair, hates when somebody cuts them down, starts drinking secretly at an early age, gets home late and is scolded like u r scolded by your dad, has a mom who loves her unconditionally, supports them at every stage, a sister who is loving and caring yet minds her own business, and above all a father who is more of a friend.The performances by everyone are exemplary especially patricia and Ethan Haque. The movie is going to win Oscars hands down. Linklater, patricia and ethan all deserve their awards. The boy ellar would be remembered forever.This ain't a movie. Its an experience and a beautiful journey of growing up. Loved it."
BOYHOOD,3 February 2015,10/10,"This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. I don't give credit easy and let it be known, out of all the movies I have ever seen, this is the only one that received a 10/10.The first thing to applaud here is the fact that the movie took 12 years to make. The same actors were used throughout and the movie had a really low budget. With that said, it felt like it was all shot once without any inconsistencies throughout. The theme and message the movie portrays was uplifting, touching and felt real. In many ways, it felt a little like watching a movie about my own life, how you go through phases growing up, how there are difficulties in your family, financially and/or emotionally. Uncertainty about life decisions, trying to fit in, trying to be your own unique person, trying to make a success out of life, growing older and making sense of everything that has happened up to this point and time.This movie has no glamour Hollywood effect, it has no massive budget and no special effects. And that's what makes it great. It's a movie that tells a story that almost everyone can deeply relate to and it does not try and sell itself. That's all it is."
BOYHOOD,1 November 2014,7/10,"I have seen a lot of Linklater movies, the ""Before sunset/sunshine/midnight"" trilogy is one of my favorites. I have a lot of respect in his work. ""Boyhood"" is an interesting movie, it is very realistic and the way that actors are growing in real time before us is something that we haven't seen in the screen. But the duration of the film is much too long, the story isn't boring neither so interesting too, we can't empathize with our heroes because they seem detached and, as the movie was heading towards the end, it was getting hard to watch, consider the 3 hours. This movie captures a lot of things, the little things, i can't express it in English language but i get it. This movie captures life and this is amazing, however, when i watch a movie, i don't want to watch life, i want to watch a movie, an interesting story , something to escape from reality. There is too much reality in this movie and i understand that many viewers find that amazing. As for me, i found it a little boring."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,,"So boring. My wife and I could only watch about 3/4 of the movie before we turned it off, and that was after almost stopping half way through. I would have given it one star, but Ethan H. was pretty good. Unfortunately there is no story and nothing much happens over the course of this movie. It was just pure tedium. I wish I didn't waste my time on this. I only watched because it was getting such good reviews and Oscar buzz. Seriously, don't bother with this or Birdman for that matter. Two incredibly boring flicks getting huge coverage. Oh, and did I say didn't care for this boring film? There 10 lines. Oops 9 lines. So boring. I don't want to add spoilers, although honestly, what possible could be considered a spoiler in a movie with no story?"
BOYHOOD,27 September 2014,8/10,"I didn't go to the cinema the first day Boyhood was released because from the title and the poster, I see no story. This film turns out to be very similar to my own boyhood. Domestic abuse, Harry Potter... Even as a Chinese transfer student, I recognize a lot of things from Mason's boyhood. And this movie taught me to look at anyone as a person who had a full experienced ""boyhood"", and those experiences pushed the wheel of ""growing up"". At many occasions, other audience laughed but I didn't get the point. I'm sure there are many nostalgic details that pull out people's empathy. My problem with the movie is Mason is never alone. And I think Loneliness is a part of a standard boyhood. (Maybe American boys never be left on their own... But I don't know that much.) I feel like Mason is always surrounded by mom, dad, sister, friend, girlfriend... But never at one moment he was truly left alone and truly lonely. There are some magical moments such as At the Harry Potter party and his step-dad throwing bowl at him. All of these moments happened exactly in my own personal boyhood and I think that audience of other ages could also find spots in this film to empathize with. I lost focus at the three quarter point of the film. But at the end of the film, Mason said something that I have been thinking about recently (at the age of 19). The amazing part of this piece of work is that the camera doesn't only captures the growing of a boy (along with his hairstyle), but also captures what he thinks about at different stages of his boyhood, and that is what made this work a great movie for me."
BOYHOOD,2 July 2017,8/10,"(Spoiler Alert) No there are not twists or climatic situations where you expect something huge to happen. This is a movie more like your life, more subtly wasted through time, often with a couple of family problems where you are a mere observer. The younger ones, as usual, observe and astonish on how disturbed older people are, and probably ask why. The movie is soft, and familiar, but its brilliance is exactly at that point, where it's more real than other movies which depict events bigger than their real aspects. Often biggest problems go on in our lives when we are just do not care much, and it goes by as if nothing much happened. Boyhood is a typical teenage life in a nutshell, not much flavor or ecstasy, but some honesty."
BOYHOOD,23 December 2014,9/10,"Might contain spoilers without any warning. Read at your own risk. Well at the time of writing this review This is the best movie I have seen that came out in 2014 (I have not seen Birdman yet). This is a movie that almost anyone above 15 can watch and connect to in one way or other. The movie is a great experience. You feel like you are growing up with ellar Coltrane (forgive any misspellings). And towards the end when Patricia Arquette is boxing up stuff and recounting the end of an era it really hits the spot. You feel her joy and sorrow at the fact that her son and daughter are finally on their own. She doesn't whether to be happy or sad. Great Acting, Great direction there is no scene in the movie that feels unnecessary (Well except the Obama campaign that they could have done without). Do watch the movie and would make the movie experience doubly better if you watch it with your mom."
BOYHOOD,11 November 2014,8/10,"""Boyhood"", one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie gave me an unique experience that I will never forget.It makes you feel warm,stupefied,emotional,breathless... It makes you feel like a HUMAN. In Linklater's masterpiece, you witness The growing of Mason, his lost of innocence,his adventures, his first contacts with violence and death, and of course, his perspectives on life changing as he grows up. To me the best moments in this film are when he talks to his parents and he realizes that life is not what he expected, the life will not ""give him protections"", that he will have to deal with the world alone and on his own way. The directing his amazing and the shots are perfect, once again Linklater focuses on the same theme as the Before Sunrise,Before Sunset and Before Midnight: THE TIME and THE MOMENT.All this movies are about time and seizing the moment, grab the emotions... The acting is brilliant, the main actor(Coltrane) is getting through the same phases as the main carachter (Mason). This new technique gives more realism to the movie and allows best interpretations and substance.Final Conclusion: Go to the nearest theater and see ""Boyhood"", you will grow as a human being and you will be more fascinated about life and everything around you. 9.5/10"
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,4/10,"This movie is yet another reminder that I may not be doing the best job at being a snobby film student. Honestly? I couldn't even finish watching it. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen by any means, but it's just so... boring. And honestly, there really isn't a harder kind of film to criticize than the kind that bores you. If you like a film, you can talk about how great the performances, the direction, the writing and such are. If you hate a film, you can talk about how incompetent it is, or what it does that annoy you. If a film is hilariously bad, you can talk about the ways it's bad and why they're funny. But if it's boring, what do you say about it? Ethan Hawke's good, so it has that going for it, but besides that, you don't exactly get excited at the opportunity to tell the world, spreading the word for all to hear, loudly proclaiming ""meh."" I don't think there's a story worth telling, it doesn't hold my attention very well, I don't really care what happens to anyone in this movie, it's not engaging, it's not exciting, all I can really do is go in circles with variations of ""I do not find the events of this move particularly interesting.""Frankly, if there is any emotional response it gets out of me, it's slight annoyance at the fact that the reason I find it so boring is both deliberate and the reason so many others love it. It's an average kid with an average life. Lot of people call it an introspective look at childhood and growing up and blah-dy-bloo. Fine if you do, but it really isn't something I care for."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2014,,"I was looking forward to this film not only because it sounded conceptual and innovative and showing great commitment from the crew, but also because of the hype, the great reviews, the positive response from the public. Maybe I had high expectations and maybe I thought it will be thought provoking, moving, intelligent and engaging. Sadly, it was nothing of the sort. I don't mind that the film has no plot, however the stories, the dialogue, the characters are simply flat - as if the products of a stoned mind. There was nothing profound nor authentic in any of the 'deep' lines served by the characters. Some of the scenes were painfully cringing and cliché - like the one where the builder from an ethnic minority speaking with a strong accent returns at the end of the film as a manager of some restaurant (it seemed) and thanks the mum for being an inspiration.Unfortunately, not a believable cinematic experience. Shame."
BOYHOOD,21 December 2014,8/10,"This was a interesting presentation of a real to life coming of age story.It is not full of trauma drama or frenetic action as some seem to expect for any movie to be good. It is not a reality show either, per se; as some make it to be. You actually see the same kids age naturally 12 years to young adulthood along with their imperfect parents who are trying to grow too.There are differing types of genera; sad few seem to understand such, but such is what makes the world go around and the visual arts what they are. If you did not enjoy the movie; maybe it has less to do with the movie and more with your choice and wrongheaded expectations! One needs to have expectations relevant to the movie they are seeing and seeking such genera that you want and not demand rehashed cookie cutter movies that meet the all to common hyperbolic types made to often these days and which is why we see so many remakes of the same old scripts and _______ VI etc.It is your right to not like it; but to be ugly do to you choose the wrong format for your taste is sad and deflecting. At least someone tried something new and original. We saw the same kids grow from childhood to young adulthood and same adults age naturally for the most part; changing naturally and not some hokey makeup or CGI effects. People come to need to much to quick nowadays and again could not put their electronics down and watch the show instead of annoying other paying customers with needless frenetic pawing at at such items and further distractedly lighting up the theater like the Starship Enterprise. The childish manners by adults whom seem to think their fat belongs in my seat or their legroom includes my space or everyone is to pickup after them as if they are some spoiled child has gotten ridiculous and contribute to why so many now seem not go to theaters anymore. It is time theaters throw rude and intrusive patrons out and ban them if need be and I know they can see such since they use night vision to monitor for lewdness and catch people recording the movies.No I am not some old bitty. I am in my 20's and wish my peers and elders would set a example for the kids and stop blaming them when they emulate their elders own bad behaviors. If the kids are a problem it is their parents and those around them fault and no one else's; as well it is not our responsibility to raise your darlings or to correct their bad behavior they learned from you or you tolerated. You make them you raise them and stop sloughing them off on society to raise for you!This movie shows some of that and how parents make repeated bad choices and then the kids suffer and society pays. Yes I know life is unfair all to well, better than 99% do. Yet stop repeating same mistakes and creating kids you can not care for; especially when you can not self-care. Raise yourself right and then think about kids; by what I saw in the theater and see daily, few so called adults are ready for self management , much-less raising kids.PS: They do offer lesson on etiquette, civility and manners and sex education too by the way; often for free! Try them and maybe you will realize you were lacking and did not know it you were not as mannered as you thought, nor understand the proper way to self-care so as to protect from pregnancy and diseases... STOP THE CYCLE OF IGNORANCE; PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY BEGINS WITH YOU!"
BOYHOOD,3 November 2014,7/10,"Good Movie, I like how the making of the movie lasted 12 years to follow up the Characters changes accurately and realistically. It shows the progress of a young boy to the beginning of adulthood. The acting was great production was good, and of course the Directing.I've never seen a movie made this way, very original concept and script. Each year was represented accurately of how it happened, I mean very great. I can see other people rating this a 10 or a 9, but I rated it an 8 because it's not my type of movie or not my genre favorite, but other than that people should watch this movie I strongly recommend it. I personally think it's the best movie of 2014."
BOYHOOD,8 February 2015,6/10,"An extremely well planned movie that has a one of a kind 12 year journey. The movie was good, however a lot of it seemed like it was trying to fill a minimum length of time. Arquette's story was very wash, rinse, repeat when it came to her marriages and wrong choice of men, she had 3 partners in the movie and all the brake ups were for similar reasons, the partner was mean to the kids, took control, did something bad to Arquette, blah blah blah. Coltrane's acting from the start, to when his voice broke, was very good but when he became a teenager it all slipped away and it seemed like he was getting less enthusiastic and was starting to lose his charm. There was lots of long, talky scenes in the movie that could have been compressed, these scenes made the movie quite boring and dragged it out. Overall the movie was good, but wouldn't have been if not for the 12 years thing, if your looking for something to put on in the background of your dinner party then this will suffice. It is far too long and could be shortened to about 2 hours while keeping the same story."
BOYHOOD,7 January 2015,10/10,"I'm only about 15 minutes removed from finishing this film and already I want to set aside time in the next few days to watch it again. When you first hear that a film was shot over a 12 year span you think that this is basically the entire selling point of the whole movie and that, novelty aside, it must not be very compelling.Speaking personally, I was incredibly skeptical that there could even be a movie that could actually follow the life of a young child (in this case, a family) into adulthood so seamlessly. For starters, what are the odds that these children would turn out to be good actors? What kind of writing depth can they achieve when so many variables can change at any moment? What could possibly even happen in a 12 year span that could leave you with any sense of closure? It's such an abstract concept that it seems almost impossible to get right...Truly, though, it does get it right. It's an amazing, amazing film. If it weren't, I certainly wouldn't be wasting my time writing such a long review.And some of the criticisms of Boyhood being plain or uneventful are just so baseless in my eyes. It doesn't require any high level of emotional intelligence whatsoever to appreciate the magic of this movie, which becomes so present within the first 30 minutes of the film. I think that as we get older we forget what life really was like when we had to grow up and mature and find out who we are as people, and the internal dialogue that comes with that during our formative years. Instead of this film being some kind of biopic, I feel that it really digs deep into the subtlety of life and how it feels to be pulled along as a child into somehow finding enough of an identity to carve out a life for ourselves as adults. This film didn't miss on any of that, and it always remained true to it's essence. I would recommend it very highly...To any and all people. To me, it's one of those films you just have to watch. If for no other reason than it will make you consider life a little more deeply. And for anyone thinking it just shows some Disney side of the maturation process, don't be fooled -- it's very real. It has every element of life that most kids face early on and it never hides any of the language or the harsh experiences of real life to leave you feeling more hopeful. It just flows along with the same rhythm you'd expect if you were observing any child growing up in today's society...Some innocence, some guilt, some peer pressure, and eventually a crossroads that will define who you turn out to be. Definitely a 10 star film! No question."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2016,6/10,"Nice. Typical, in the best sense of the word. It can be the life of any of us. Typical places without falling into clichés. Very well taken. You really get the feeling that takes a lifetime in a few hours. Drama, joy, experience; life itself. Great performances. It is a very good work, because it is not easy to portray the life. Well it covers everyone and all ages. It is easy to watch an afternoon one morning or night, rain. With a Coke. Or eating. Or at any time, but with time, because it is a bit long. You can see a little now, and a little later. Or divide it into three parts, and look at three different times of day. 7/10. Good movie."
BOYHOOD,24 December 2019,4/10,"I cannot understand how someone can rate this movie with 10 stars. ratings seem just so out of place these days. If someone likes a movie, it gets 10 stars. If someone dislikes a movie, it gets 1 star. Where's the point here? Same applies to this movie. Unfortunately, lots of people out there like to get bored to death!Yes, it´s a great idea shooting a movie over a couple of years to illustrate how a boy grows up and becomes a young man, but that´s all the greatness you will encounter while watching this never ending story. There's not much happening. Actually, there's nothing happening at all. Most characters feel flat and two-dimensional as there is no character development. Honestly, I did not feel any emotion while watching this movie, just the relief when it ended. However, there are far worse movies out there, so 4 stars for this one seems legit."
BOYHOOD,10 February 2017,7/10,"While Boyhood was both new and interesting, the film lacked some key elements that caused it to fall short of the mostly outstanding critic reviews. To begin with, it lacked a constant plot. While the movie's story line was supposed to follow the life of a boy as he grew into an adult, it seemed more like a documentary rather than a movie, as there was no rising action, climax, or resolution, which made the film seem flat, and unexciting. The characters were also strangely difficult to relate to, even though the entire film was meant to document real life struggles and issues, with the main protagonist taking on a quiet and aloof demeanor throughout the majority of the movie, which caused him to feel more like a supporting and static character, rather than a dynamic one, despite his physical changes. After all this though, the movie was definitely groundbreaking, and I give the director and producers props for creating a completely new type of movie."
BOYHOOD,16 July 2018,,"Anyone who has seen any work from Richard Linklater knows what kind of a filmmaker he is. He waited between years to complete his ""Before"" trilogy and with Boyhood he has gone a step further and actually filmed the actor in real time. The real time extent here is a staggering 18 years and the coming of age aspect is enhanced by this fact alone. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play the parents of the lead and the young actors, especially Ellar Coltrane is exceptional. This is a must watch for all cinema lovers."
BOYHOOD,30 December 2014,9/10,"Wait! I am going to watch a three hour movie about a family not named Corleone, where nothing blows up? no one gets shot? Where nothing happens except a view into the life of a family just like yours and mine. And I will enjoy it? Who would have thought. A beautifully done concept movie where the actors come back for twelve years to chronicle the life of a young boy from age 6 to 18.The family experiences just about everything we do, without excess. And after all isn't real life more interesting, and more moving, than fiction.My Compliments to all involved for signing on and coming back year after year, you can feel how they all loved the idea of the children aging into young men and women.Highly recommend this movie, a work of art without being artsy."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,5/10,"I usually comment when a movie leaves me with a strong impression, either good or bad, and this one is for the second reason. Some people said that one of the strategies to make a story is to raise the stakes and think in terms of ""if this was not enough""... something new makes the things even worse. But in this movie the pattern is ""if this was not enough"", something even better happens. A moving 12 year epic? This is almost not even a story. It is like a documentary about some people's lives. Or it is like a manual, it has about 5 situations where the characters are so smart that they can serve as models for training for personal development. This movie is a lot like life, but exaggerated in a positive sense. I suppose the reason that it does not have a good story is due to commercial interests, but it also can be sloppiness. This movie goes on my list of high rated movies that actually make me feel disappointed about humanity. Though it is not as bad as Avatar. I did expect a better movie. The title Boyhood made me think it somehow presents the essence of Boyhood. But instead it literally presents the Boyhood of a person without much mystery and drama."
BOYHOOD,13 February 2015,,"I Just watched ""Boyhood"" and decided to come to IMDb to see what others thought of it. Seems either people love it or hate, there isn't a middle of the road here. Well, I am middle of the road.The concept is amazing. Film a boy and his family over 12 years using the same actors about his life growing up. Having a novel idea does not make a great movie. I do believe if I had not known before hand I would not of enjoyed it as much as I did.There isn't a plot, climax or amazing ending. It is a peek into a boys life at various times and his life is average. There isn't one thing that happens to him that is out of the ordinary, However, it is still interesting to see someone's life, and knowing that it was filmed over time and seeing how people really do change made it reach to a ""good"" film and surpass being a ""bad"" film, in my opinion."
BOYHOOD,9 July 2021,6/10,It is not my type. I did not enjoy it. However I appreciated how they shot it during twelve years of period.
BOYHOOD,28 September 2019,4/10,"This is well directed, edited, acting etc, but the trial and tribulations of young boy/man.
The movie spends most its time centered on Mason, in his growing up = and the fears and anxiety we ALL have gone thru as children into adolescence.
It brough NOTHING new.
Mason continues to be self-absorbed through out the movie, in search for the meaning of self.
It just lacks true dynamic change in his character. Just a not very interesting gimmicky movie."
BOYHOOD,10 December 2014,9/10,"There are small, unremarkable moments in life that seem to linger in our memories for far longer than they should. When we think about our lives thus far, there are the obvious milestones that stick out, last day of school, the first time you got drunk, the first time you fell in love, the first time you got your heart broken, so on and so forth. All subjects worthy of a film plot, to one degree or another.Yet then there are trivial, unremarkable moments in life that linger in our minds memory and yet have no right nor need to be there, seemingly. Fleeting incidents, noteworthy only in their collective banality, and yet they hang around.Because life isn't really a collection of milestones, as Patricia Arquette's character in Boyhood determines, but a collection of transitory incidents. This is the idea Richard Linklater has built his film Boyhood around, a film in which nothing really happens and it just might be the best film of the year.Linklater cast the six year-old Ellar Coltrane as Mason, taking a few weeks out of each of the subsequent 12 years to shoot small fragments of Boyhood, so as the audience could view Mason's character grow up in real time. It is a totally unique achievement in feature film-making and in doing this Linklater has taken the coming of age drama to a level it hasn't been to before.Ethan Hawke, who is one of the films numerous joys as Mason's at first useless then energetic and warm father, described the film making process as being like making a short every year for 12 years. Just consider for a moment the amount of variables Linklater was surrendering to once he committed to this project.Firstly, there is obviously Mason, whom Linklater could have had no idea at 6 years of age would have developed the talent to hold the character down as well as the focus or interest to stick around.Take into account the number of changes that occur in our own lives over a 12 year period and we might be closer to realizing just how much could have gone wrong during this production.Linklater's film captures the feeling of maturing, not just through boyhood but through adulthood in the case of Hawke and Arquette, unlike any film I can remember. The story follows Mason through the various stages of growing up, arguing with his sister, being chastised by his mother, and bonding with his Father.Ethan Hawke brings the added spark to the film every time it's needed. Patricia Arquette is mesmerizing, most notably having left her drunken husband and in mid melt down when asked by her daughter, 'What are we going to do?' 'I don't know, I don't know what we're going to do', she erupts. Parents don't always have the answer.They usually think they do though. One of the most subtle and spot on aspects in Boyhood is that Mason is constantly being told what to do by his elders so much so that even we the audience grow weary of it. But it's totally accurate. Isn't this exactly how we all experienced childhood? It very much brought to mind The 400 Blows in this respect.I touched on the idea of Coltrane perhaps tiring of the project and jacking it in. Although he obviously doesn't jack it in, once he reaches the awkward teenage years you can see a certain shift in his performance, awkwardness encompassed with a hint of disinterest. Whether this is Coltrane's natural teenage awkwardness coming through or a conscious move on the part of him and the filmmakers is unclear and irrelevant, what matters is it works perfectly.Once Mason reaches the age of 17 he becomes pretty hard going, growing into a dark and difficult young man. This too is surely accurate, however that doesn't mean that his rants don't become a little bit irritating and tiresome after a while. In this portion of the movie the real delight is watching the development of Hawke and Arquette into mid-life.It's as much their film as it is Coltrane's. Their growing in front of the screen becomes more fascinating as the film goes on, unlike Mason's which becomes a touch harder to bare. Again, maybe this is just totally accurate to teenagers.The film's idea is well summarized by Arquette in her final scene. Her only Son is leaving her alone in her small, empty apartment to depart for college. She suddenly realizes that her life has been a collection of those transitory moments, the little, seemingly meaningless, moments. And now they're all gone and her only son is departing the nest.The film is innovative in story-telling and leaves the viewer feeling certain content with life during the hours following viewing. A feeling that we're all in the same boat and all our lives are made up of is those fleeting and seemingly meaningless moments. And then they're gone. Like all great films this film puts a mirror up against our own lives and forces us to take a good, long, look."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,3/10,"This picture should be excluded from any Oscar consideration simply due to the almost unwatchable opening 10 minutes. We considered leaving in shock. Kids and parents shrieking at each other from some bad 1980s Disney comedy, and utterly predictable reliance throughout on hip music to make up for how little emotional impact is being relayed on screen.A scene of boys camping out in an unfinished house is unintentionally laughable in dialog and acting, throwing believability out the window. Some of Arquette's lines as well fall astoundingly flat - were there any editors here?The lead is fantastic, and to see him change over the 12 years is a treat, a reason to note this experiment in film. But stories worth retelling require more continuity, forethought, PACING, and some sort of arc that it seems Linklater didn't bother with (or couldn't due to the limitations of the experiment?). The longest feeling movie I have sat through in years..."
BOYHOOD,1 August 2014,10/10,"So I thought I would too. I deliberately did no research going into the film, didn't even watch the trailer. Didn't know it was 3 hours till I got out and glanced in surprise at the time, so yes it is a spot of commitment. While my friend had high expectations based on his research of the film, I was just there for the ride, and what a ride it was for me. I've always loved Linklater's work, especially the 'sun' series with his raw approach to humanity, and brilliant vision of life in general. When you see these characters in snip-its over such a long period of time, you become really invested in them, and it so unlike any film I've come across, perhaps hints of Forrest Gump meets Stand By Me, Meets Tree of Life. It's not a high octane film, rather hypnotic if you ask me, but I was deeply satisfied with watching life unfold. It's early, and I'm often wrong on Oscar predictions, but I'd love to see this take home a statuette for writing. I feel bad for the people that don't embrace this masterpiece, but for those preaching to the choir, I say thank you to Richard for sharing perhaps his finest work to date."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2015,10/10,"Richard Linklater has proved yet again that he is one of the best. His 12 year long project has turned out to be one of the most beautiful movies ever made! He makes a movie quite like the 'before ...' series, but instead of showing us a big snippet of the lives of a couple after a long time, be decides to do a 'time lapse' like movie depicting a young boy growing up to become a man, the hardships he had to face during this time and how his relationship with his family changes over the years. Linklater does very well in depicting the lives of a middle class family in the present day, and as in the before series, he brings up the topics of the ever changing affairs of the world. The movie succeeds in enthralling you into the world of young mason (Ellar) his divorced mother(Patricia) and his elder sister (Lorelei) in the years be is growing up. Ethan hawke gives a good performance as his dad. The movie is filled with powerful performances by every actor, especially patricia as the mother. At the end, you are left with a warm feeling and a sense of varying emotions:love, hate, gratitude, sadness and happiness, all together. This makes the movie one of the best, and probably one that will be talked about for a long time to come. FINAL VERDICT:a must watch for all!"
BOYHOOD,14 July 2014,8/10,"Shot with the same cast over the course of 12 years, Boyhood chronicles the childhood and young adulthood of a boy in Texas as his family,surroundings and perspective on the world are gradually and drastically altered. The boy, Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane, who literally grows up on screen in front of the audience's eyes), experiences the full gamut of youth development as we follow his maturation from a timid 5-year old into a thoughtful college freshman trying to bridge the gap between his old life and a new one. Although the film's ambition credentializes it as unlike anything to hit theaters, its execution and award-worthy performances justify the lofty expectations that preceded its release.The film's running time of 164 minutes, which may be daunting for some, is mitigated by its highly engaging structure in which the same characters are presented to the audience as they endure the very real effects of time, and where the characters, tone and story are treated as malleable reflections of real-life sentiments and struggles about gracefully getting along in the world (in a recent interview Ethan Hawke referred to the film as a ""crucible"" for the cast and Linklater to deposit their evolving notions of childhood and parenthood). The relatively long running time is also helped by an unexpected and unique brand of comedy, mostly centered on the awkwardness and pitfalls of navigating youth and the buoyant relationship between a child and his childish father.Through the film's linear structure, we catch glimpses of many recognizable and accessible milestones in Mason's life: collecting rocks, camping trips, ballgames, new friends becoming old friends, facial hair, trying beer, first relationship, first serious relationship, trying drugs, visiting colleges, asking big questions, trying more drugs, getting a car, moving into the dorms etc. Supporting cast members sporadically pop into Mason's life in the form of friends, classmates and flings, naturally causing the viewer to recollect their own childhood memories of people and places they thought to be forgotten forever.While this compatibility with the common notion of what ""growing up"" means is part of what forges the film's connection with the audience, Boyhood's broad swaths are heavily complemented by the specificity of Mason's experience. His development and identity are informed by much of what happens in his particular youth, such as living in West Texas, being raised by a single mother, surviving abuse, frequently changing schools, losing touch with friends and family, and discovering photography. We intimately observe his relationship with his mother (Patricia Arquette) as she doggedly and frustratingly trudges through her own life in search of stability and fulfillment, uprooting her children and moving them from town to town as boyfriends and husbands transform into ex's and monsters. We similarly watch Mason's bond with his biological father (brilliantly played by an upbeat and hilarious Ethan Hawke) strengthen over the years as the destitute drifter reinserts himself into his children's lives to offer advice and cautionary tales sourced from experience. So while the film's goal is to capture Boyhood with a capital ""B,"" it is not without a healthy dose of characterization and story to disaggregate Mason's life from the audience's.However, a specific cohort of viewers (myself included) will find this problematic considering the influence time and place have on how Mason's formative years are depicted. Linklater's canvas is early to mid 2000's America and he brilliantly colors it with pop culture and iconography appropriate for the times, including but not limited to a catchy soundtrack (Coldplay, Blink 182, Sheryl Crow and The Hives narrate Mason's early years) and the increasingly pervasive presence of technology (Gameboy, online pornography, deleting Facebook and hiding his ""digital ghost"" from the NSA maintain varying levels of importance to the protagonist). We are reminded that Mason is coming of age in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 in a highly politicized climate that Linklater captures with uncanny accuracy; one of the inarguable benefits of filming over 12 years is the ability to eschew a backwards looking perspective, thus minimizing the risk of missing the targeted essence of not only what happened at a specific time in history, but also what it felt like to actually live through it.A common theme of Boyhood—and to an extent Linklater's work in general—is that development and change are constant. Not only is it clear that Mason is not fully grown up when the credits roll, he's downright confused about his place in the world and what he's meant to do—which is almost exactly where nearly every college freshman finds themselves on that first night away from home. And although the film is about Mason, Linklater wants us to know that the process is age-agnostic; Mason's father, for example, doesn't get his act together until what looks like his mid 30's. His mother, forced into parenthood by an early pregnancy, had to forego college initially and spend much of adulthood grasping at self-sustainability, to the point where Mason muses that she's ""just as confused as I am."" In the same vein of his Before series where Celine and Jesse's personalities and relationships are continually in flux, Linklater's Boyhood offers an indelible and refreshing reminder that life is a constant stream of consciousness, not a compartmentalized sequence of phases. More importantly, he wants us to know that there is always time to change, grow, and have new and beautiful experiences with the important people in our lives.If the point of movies and storytelling in general is to elicit an emotional response, it's hard to find a better proverbial string to pull on than nostalgia. Boyhood is peppered with the little idiosyncrasies of being a kid and becoming an adult that sum up to a deeply personal and reflective viewing experience. Coupled with the sheer impressiveness of actually completing the film in spite of obvious execution risk, changing technology and potential cast attrition, this makes for a unique and rewarding movie-going experience."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2014,3/10,"Worse than just being overly long and tedious, Boyhood it is packed with annoying, dysfunctional characters, really more clichés than troubled human beings, and tells no stories. There is no character to admire or sympathize with, and we don't even understand why these people behave the way they do. There is no story or drama to catch your interest, and much of transpired was unbelievable. The daughter is endlessly insolent to her mother; I don't know any girls like that, and I can't imagine any mother would take it the way she did. The professor is over-the-top creepy and phony from the start, and turns out to be a monster. Why would the mother go for him? I could go on, it is all grating. I can't help compare Boyhood with The Tree of Life, another overly long, ponderous, potentially tedious film about a boy growing up. But Tree of Life is redeemed by enormous humanity, intelligent and real people, and a boy who learns about life in front of our eyes. The father, played by Brad Pitt, can be horrible to his wife and kids, but often wonderful to them too, and in a completely believable, fully fleshed out human way, unlike the series of cardboard creeps Boyhood tries to pass off as men."
BOYHOOD,1 March 2015,10/10,"If this film is not a miracle of sorts, then, I don't know what is. Time is the plot, yes, and it overtakes without us noticing when or how and the next stop is ""my f""%&ing funeral"" Patricia Arquette gives ""Boyhood"" its palpitating heart. It reminded me and confirmed that the future is female and that Patricia Arquette is one of the greatest actresses that ever lived. That incident with her Mexican laborer and its consequences (I don't want to give away too much) are one of the many gems this miracle of a movie exposes. Ethan Hawke, heartbreaking, funny, enormously real and then, Lorelei Linklater, beautiful, unique. Ellar Coltrane...where do I start here? I hope he knows that the truth and beauty of his creation, touched, transformed and enlightened anyone who came to meet you with an open heart. Firstly and lastly, Richard Linklater...he's been a hero mine for a long time but now, he's in a place that I reserve only for him. Artist, adventurer, explorer, storyteller, miracle worker. His film, for us who look from the outside, is a hymn to family, friendship, loyalty and cinema. Thank you sir, thank you all."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2014,7/10,"Richard Linklater (Dazed & Confused, Before Sunset) directed this. I actually like him -- or at least I think I do. I LOVED Dazed & Confused. I've re-watched it so many times, those characters are basically friends of mine at this point. D&C was nostalgic for an age I didn't actually experience much, but it resonated with me instantly. I didn't even necessarily like all of the characters, but I ""knew"" them.However, I can't really say I love any other Linklater movies. Or even like a lot of them. He's a strange director. His style of movie is generally a quasi-real time, warts-and-all, slice of life; a funny/awkward look at creative class Whites-- they're young (or young at heart), though all seem to be experiencing mid-life crises. On paper, it actually sounds pretty terrible, but when it works, as in D&C, it's unique, uplifting and empathetic.Linklater's latest, Boyhood, is about a kid called Mason, covering moments of his life from age 5-18. His sister (played by Linklater's own daughter) is featured as well, but not quite to Mason's degree -- hence the title. And it was a good movie. However, for such an ambitious concept, in the hands of a director who's shown he can wring a good story out of mundane details, I don't think I really cared about the characters for most of it.The idea of filming someone over such a long stretch is pretty cool in theory (though years of people doing this on their own via Youtube or Facebook selfies has perhaps stolen some of Linklater's conceptual thunder). I was interested to see how Mason changed, both physically and personally, but again, the concept was probably more interesting than the result. Mason, however well might get to know him in the film, turns out to have most of the issues you'd think a smart, shy, creative kid would. And he gets through them (predictably) awkwardly.For me, the most interesting character in the movie was actually Mason's dad, played by Ethan Hawke. He's a reckless, ""edgy"" musician who wears (and drives) black. Sounds cliché, right? But Hawke's character changes over the course of the film, eventually becoming a vaguely grizzled, but wise middle-aged guy. Despite never really amounting to much in his own life, he sees the error of his ways, and is happy to pass on any ""wisdom"" he thinks might help Mason.Likewise, Mason's mom (Patricia Arquette) was a good, strong character -- struggling as single mom with two kids, going back to college, and working to upgrade her family's life. She eventually has some bad luck with subsequent husbands, but it's easy to root for her.Mason himself, played by Ellar Coltrane, seems like a curious, perceptive boy. He's shy, but not so much that he won't go biking with friends as a child, or camping with bros in high school. He likes photography, and girls seem to like him more than he realizes. And that's pretty much it-- which brings me to the only real issue I have with Boyhood. The movie never hooks me with Mason's life beyond the narrative of the movie, or to become curious about what might happen next. Without spoiling the ending, I'll say that although it hit the right note in the theater, I feel as if I might have been able to predict it had someone asked me 10 minutes before it happened. Or not -- but it didn't feel any more less significant than other events in the movie.In fact, I might just predict what happens next, should Linklater keep the story going, and continue filming Mason into college, marriage, midlife crises, second marriage, etc. Perhaps Mason follows his parent's footsteps into relative stability. Or, maybe he develops a drug problem after moving to Portland when he drops out of college. Boyhood is a relatively engaging slice of life alright, but not much else.As a side note, Coltrane reminded me of D&C's Wiley Wiggins, both in his character's traits and various life events. Wiggins' Mitch Kramer was a wide-eyed kid who got swept up by life, friends, girls, and somehow lucked into a pretty epic night through no effort of his own (but to be willing to go along for the ride). Coltrane's Mason didn't have such a breakneck adventure, but he did generally seem to come out okay, both with girls and life. Unfortunately, neither actor is terribly ""expressive"", and for me, Linklater's track record for leading men is questionable.Of course, if Linklater is merely telling the story of one boy's life, I won't feel obligated to make any value judgment at all. However, if I'm supposed to be taking something away from these characters, it would probably be along the lines of ""life is hard, make the most of it, we all make mistakes, you never know what'll be"". That's good, I guess. It also sounds like something your, er, dad would impart, in a particularly embarrassing fit of earnestness.Ultimately, perhaps ""life"" can only ever be intermittently interesting. Boyhood is likable, poignantly funny, and surprisingly justified in its 3-hour length. And like life, no matter how fascinating, frustrating, exhilarating or crushing, is also sometimes forgettable. It just happens. Linklater's captured magic before, and Boyhood is hardly a bad movie, but...maybe you had to be there."
BOYHOOD,15 April 2015,2/10,"At first glance, the coming-of-age drama ""Boyhood"" seemed to have an intriguing premise. Take the same, undeniably talented actors playing the same characters over the course of 12 years and have their characters age as they do. It's not hard to tell that director Richard Linklater and the most prominent actors, such as Ellar Coltrane as Mason, the boy in question, Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his divorced parents, put a lot of heart into the project. Which made me sad to find out that the final result was such an unmitigated failure.The story, if it can be called that, is about Mason, who at the start in 2002 is six years old and living with his single mother and his sister Sam (played by Linklater's own daughter), spending time with his easygoing father on occasion. The same year, the mother moves the family to Houston so she can get a college degree. This becomes the start of a two and a half hour long series of largely disjointed events. As the years go by, Mason grows up and he goes through puberty, high school and eventually goes to college. In the meantime, his mother remarries, as does his father, and other things happen. And sadly, none of it has any noticeable effect whatsoever on Mason.The biggest, and ultimately fatal problem with ""Boyhood"" is the fact that nothing that happens ever seems to make a difference. When Mason is ten years old, his stepfather turns into an abusive alcoholic who starts beating his mother. She later leaves him and takes Mason and Sam with her. What happened to this stepfather and his biological children? We never find out, because the drinking and the beating never comes up again a single time in the whole film. Pretty much everything that happens gets the same treatment in Linklater's script, which seems to have been written as the filming went along without a plot or concrete ending in mind. We see Mason get bullied at school, he goes to watch a Harry Potter movie, his friends show him nude pictures of women online, he visits his grandparents and fires a rifle, he sets up Obama-Biden posters during the election.All of this just flows by without ever really sticking or leaving a mark at all, not from one year to the next, the one after that or any time in the plot at all. You'd think that Mason's mother, who was married to a violent, reckless alcoholic, would take some issue with her son drinking in high school and smoking weed, but she doesn't. Nor does watching nude pictures affect his view on women, or using firearms change his views on guns or the bullying make him throw gay slurs around. At almost every scene, I felt like ""This will be relevant later"", or ""This will teach Mason something"", but nothing like that ever happened.Linklater writes his story very much the same way an average person's life tends to play out - a lot of everyday moments with little to no real connection and with no concrete final goal in sight. And there's nothing wrong with living like that, but when you take the time to put so many inconsequential happenings into a script, shoot them on tape and present them as a film, it makes for horrible storytelling."
BOYHOOD,30 July 2017,9/10,"An all-encompassing film about growing up and coming of age. Of course, the movie being actually filmed over 12 years with the same cast adds an extra very rare dimension to it. Ellar Coltrane gives a great performance as the dreaming little boy, maturing into the uncertain adolescent, with all the ups and downs of growing up thrown in. Ethan Hawke is excellent as the estranged but loving father; Patricia Arquette is very realistic as the troubled mother with her string of drunken lovers. The first half of the film could almost have been called Girlhood, because it is almost as much about Samantha as Mason; and Lorelei Linklater is quite brilliant as the smart-alec but lovable older sister. Although the film essentially has no plot, it is a really feel-good film about the terrors and wonders of growing up. A big thumbs up."
BOYHOOD,11 August 2014,10/10,"First movie after landing in US --> Boyhood. I knew when I leased my apartment that I have made a very good decision to take an apartment near university. But finding it 10mins walk to a theater thats specifically shows indie movies and has 6 shows of boyhood running everyday, I realized what an awesome apartment I have taken. Boyhood was everything I wanted from it and more. I never wanted it to end, but time flies, kids grow. they go to college. and you get on. And I did and I guess everyone does. Linklator has done a job linklator worthy while editing and collating his footage spanning across 12 years. When I saw his before midnight, tape, and waking life last year. I knew this is a director kids will talk about and revere in future. He's the most natural contemporary director and even the emotions or dialogues that feel like cliché in our regular movies, feel heartfelt in his. I am no good at writing reviews or articulation, even if have like gazillion thoughts about something in my head, I can never express them. And if this movie has made me write this much, it must be something. I am going to watch it again tomorrow as classes haven't started yet and the dream I have is to work on something like this one day. Ending is perfect!"
BOYHOOD,21 February 2015,8/10,"The idea of Boyhood is groundbreaking — tracking a family over 12 years. It's very neat watching a family evolve before your eyes. Director Richard Linklater puts together such a complicated puzzle. The movie promotes the growth of the boy, but it's the development of Patricia Arquette as the mom that is most interesting. Arquette showcases a mom who is doing all she can to provide the best foundation for her children. While her kids are growing, the aging mother encounters homelessness, an abusive partner, and an absentee partner while she works her way through college to eventually provide the family with a firm — but still shaky — foundation. She is the prototypical Generation X mom. Although the premise of Boyhood is groundbreaking, the story — which is simply working class life — begins to lose its luster."
BOYHOOD,3 December 2014,8/10,"The thing that struck me about how 'Boyhood' is how much we humans like stories. Mason grows up, is the artsy type, lives through parents' divorces, has hits and misses in his love life, is maybe a bit entitled, graduates from high school and goes to college. For some reason you wanna watch this for 2 hours and 45 minutes.There have been in depth documentaries that follow people through their lives. People lap up life nuggets served up by HONY. I rarely find myself disappointed at others life choices even when I find mine quite lacking. The thing Boyhood nails on the head is our need to identify with others. Brought to finesse by maintaining a cast for 12 years. The success of Boyhood is in the film-making as much as it is in the film itself.People would be justified in saying nothing really happens in the movie. They'd be right. Nothing does happen in the movie in the way of a true plot what with not having a conflict, a climax, a resolution and what have you. See, that's the thing about our lives. All of us are maybe just a one big collective inconsequential nothing. But personally, to you, your life is all that really matters.Which is why you spend all your time trying to make it worthwhile. A life lived is thing of beauty in itself just because YOU are living it. Linklater deserves praise for executing his cinematic experiment beautifully, though I doubt another 'insert label'-hood will elicit same magic. I think it can pass for genius only once. Much like James Cameron's imaginative opulence in formulaic Avatar or Stephanie Meyer's super-gooey ( it worked for me) portrayal of Miss-I-won't-really-miss-my-father-and-best-friend Bella's addiction of Edward.Boyhood is a remembrance, a metaphor, sometimes a lesson, sometimes an anecdote and says things we just mumble inside our heads because they are little too inane to say out loud. It is a first and will probably be the only one of its kind. Watch it for its pure ability to be a evocative reflecting mirror."
BOYHOOD,30 August 2014,5/10,"One of the more overrated films lately.The good: production, shooting, editing, sound -- were all good.The great: the idea of following the same boy and others for 11 years. Transitions from age to age were beautiful.The tiresome: the acting. It was OK, but nothing that grabs you. Ellar Coltrane was at his acting best when he was young, but gradually got more stilted. This could have been due to the director more than to him.The ugly: The script. Existential drivel, over and over. Every character was written in a way that remained two-dimensional, especially his sister and mother. Ethan Hawke as his father did the best job of any of them in bringing some depth of life to his role."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2014,10/10,"This masterpiece is unbelievable. It is a true story. A true story of Mason, of me, of every human. I didn't believe that there is someone so smart to make such a movie. Richard Linklater proved me wrong. The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Shawshank Redemption....Boyhood Surpassed all of those very much. I believe that in a decade or so we will see Boyhood #1 on IMDb because it simply deserves it! As soon as you begin watching the movie you are in. You don't feel you are watching the movie..you are living it. Whenever you want to live your old days again, all you have to do is to go watch Boyhood I know that there will never be a movie like this to the end of the world...I sware it was like breathing....the movie is alive! Anybody got to watch this movie. It is an antidote for the weary of spirit. It is a time machine. It is a miracle. And if this movie didn't win the Best Picture Academy Award I will seriously suicide!"
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,3/10,"First, an embarrassing admission. I didn't read the synopsis of the movie ahead of time, and during the opening scenes I remarked to myself just how good Patricia Arquette looks these days. :-) As I watched the film, I kept on waiting for something (anything) to actually happen. There are a few dramatic scenes of family issues sparsely scattered here and there. But, not much of anything noteworthy takes place during the entire length of the film - and it is a long film. The ""boy"" spends the entire last hour of the film doing little more than grinning and mumbling. I appreciate the commitment and the 12 year effort that went into making this film. But at the end of the day, there still has to be something of value to watch. And for me, there wasn't.Finally, I find it utterly incomprehensible that this movie has an IMDb rating of 8.9. How is that possible? For the life of me, I have no idea how viewers can score this movie higher than some of the greatest movies of all time. Sorry, but I can't take IMDb ratings seriously any more. They were always a little bit suspect, but this is shear madness."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,9/10,"Boyhood (2014), by far, is one of the most extraordinary movies you could watch during the span of your life. It is neither drama nor documentary, but yet still carries some essence of both within itself.It is monotonic as hell and there's not much twists and turns during the three-hour picture, but that's what the lives of most people are translated into. After all, not everyone turns out to be Bruce Wayne, Muhammad Ali, or John F. Kennedy. It is taken Richard Linklater nearly 4000 days or 12 years to produce this flick in which he's actually waited for the cast to age before moving on to the next stages. It needs a bit good amount of patience to get through the whole movie, but it definitely is all relieving when you do drag yourself along with the seven-year-old boy that grows up to be a college freshman (which'll continue with That's What I'm Talking About in 2015). This is another Benjamin Button only in the right order and real life and if Mr. Christopher Nolan calls it the best movie of 2014"
BOYHOOD,3 May 2015,7/10,"First of all, the unique and extraordinary characteristic of this film is that it ""follows"" the growing up of the leading actor, Mason, as well as the other actors' lives. Some people may find this film disappointing, saying that it's about nothing and nothing happens. But this film is about LIFE as it is! About the unbelievable difficulties of a single-divorced mother trying to raise her children while trying to achieve her personal ambitions, about the adultness, about relationships and family. Watching this movie, I understood more the inside of the parents, their justified stress and anxieties, their huge responsibilities that I couldn't see so clear before! Ι didn't regret for watching this film and I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into and understand the family relationships and difficulties."
BOYHOOD,8 January 2015,5/10,"I thought the filming was excellent. There's nothing like surprising an audience by the gradual aging of characters. Life happens. Time passes, but we don't usually see it in ""short"" form.This is an American movie, as I am 100% sure not all cultures raise their children this way, with no interaction, no close relatives to take up the slack when the children are younger and need ""culturing."" What I saw was the American way to grow up to be nothing in particular. Neither parents nor children had much aim, passion or intellect. As Mason Sr. would say, all they have is what they feel today. That is their non-cultured reality. This is not everyone's way of life, but the life of the lost, aimless, those who have no higher motivation or desire for attainment, who need constant stimulus (games, drugs, booze) to feel alive.A lot of people may relate, but it's not the only way to see life. I am not surprised, after looking at this film, that America's generation X are being bypassed for jobs in the world market. The film is ""relative"" to many people's lives, but when put into perspective of the world, and the world market for workers, we shouldn't be surprised that the youth of other motivated, schooled, disciplined, committed youth are being slotted for jobs that should belong to Mason. Brilliant."
BOYHOOD,4 July 2015,9/10,"For some it is difficult to fit a full story or plot line in a 2 hour film. Boyhood took 12 years of a boys life and compressed it into less than 3 hours. This film was a pretty darn successful experiment, something not tried before. Although it is not a perfect film, it really captures the life of this one boy with very few negatives and many positives. So many movies try and capture the coming to age theme, but Boyhood accomplishes that through the growing of this one boy. He faces problems so many people face today and you get to see how he handles each one. In some scenes it is slower and more dramatic than others, but overall it captures the life of this boy wonderfully. If you watch this movie i can assure you, you are bound to relate to one thing this kid was going through. You really see how each character feels. Although the dialogue wasn't perfect it seemed authentic and real. I give Boyhood a 9/10 because it is so different and entertaining see this kid grow up and I was engaged throughout the whole movie. It is not your ordinary drama film, but something definitely worth watching."
BOYHOOD,19 July 2015,4/10,"With all the buzz before movie came out I was thrilled to finally watch it. Turned out to be huge disappointment. After a while movie was nominated in several categories and also winning many of them at Academy Awards, Golden Globes and others. I was truly confused and all good words and awards of movie seamed like undeserved acknowledgment - like the good grade that teacher gives to student for effort, but not for the great result. Yes, approach of the movie making is unique and requires patience and lot of resources, but that does not matter if story is weak.All in all movie is considerably boring and main character may annoy you by lack of personality and action. I believe that lifeline of most viewers would turn out in a lot more interesting story than current result."
BOYHOOD,24 October 2016,6/10,"I one time bought Boyhood due to its massive critical acclaim, but later forgotten it, until I watched it recently. I think the critics loved it mainly because of its way of how they filmed it. It's filmed in short sections from 2002 to 2013 and we see characters grow old and mature. The actors returned to their roles every year and film makers didn't have to hire more actors to play characters older counterparts. Indeed it's a fantastic concept and should be praised for the risk the filmmakers made and somehow managed to make it work. But does that in itself make the movie good? Not really. Yes, it does make it watchable, but in order to make it good, it needs to have a stable foundation and structure. A lot could happen in a few years and consequences could go both ways. People change, opinions change, situations change and that also includes the ones made this movie in terms of writing, ideas and other stuff. So is the movie any good? It honestly depends what you're looking, but since it can be done to any movie, what makes this movie any different. Some people loved Boyhood because shows what life is in 12 year cap, but the others have said that it's boring for the same reason. I personally understand both parties and for that, my opinion is mixed. The 2nd half was indeed slightly boring as you expect something big to happened but nothing, as some people say, melodramatic, happens. The plot can be a really unfocused at some points. The dialogue though is alright and the acting most of the time good. They did their best, but I didn't like the way the main character was going at the last hour and the protagonist's part is the most important part in drama movies, so you can relate to. The editing and directing was OK, but nothing revolutionising as critics say.At the end; Boyhood is alright movie with good concept and acting, but does get boring if you want things to happen and if don't care about the main character. 6/10"
BOYHOOD,28 January 2019,9/10,"The fact that this movie was shot with the same cast over 12 years is fascinating. Even if you didn't know about this, the movie is still a fantastic coming-of-age tale. Some shotty acting at some points doesn't ruin the film, and it is really great overall."
BOYHOOD,1 October 2020,9/10,Boyhood movie could boring some times but you can't understand the meaning of the movie until you see the character getting older and going through life experience
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,10/10,"I'm trying to ignore some of the negative reviews by some critics on here making me very frustrated. Boyhood is an excellent film and a wonderful film experiment by Richard Linklater. This is a time companion and you can reflect on all the music, new fads and events that occurred since the new millennium. In years to come this will be an historical film much like films like that defined a decade like Rebel Witnout A Cause or The Graduate. A film masterpiece hoping it snags The OscarsMy only fault is that Ellar Coltrane reminds me of Justin Bieber at times as he is growing up. A great performance"
BOYHOOD,25 September 2014,6/10,"The name 'boyhood' is kind of misleading although the movie's shown only about the boyhood of Mason until he goes for his graduation to some college and get interested in photography. Critics really liked more than people do! Because the project had enough risks for a successful execution but Richard Linklater did it, its really something that have never seen before something unique and risky. From 2002 to 2013 total of 45 days of shooting until the boy grew up from his age 7 to 18. Such a long contract with the crew and if Richard dies then who'd manage the such long project! Of course Ethan Hawke, one of Richard's favorites but Linklatet did it. It shows what happens to our life with every passing time and according to him nothing. You grow up, you struggle, you baffled, you are taken care of then fall in love, get married, have kids..and what happens? Life goes on...but nothing really happens. To illustrate this he took the life of a 7 years kid, Coltrane and changed his name to Mason in the movie. I like Ethan Hawke, he's the first choice of Richard's movies especially for his before sunrise series, most of Richard's movies which are usually dramatic so Ethane was perfect to be a jobless dad who tries to direct the right path for his son and every year with Coltrane he shot the movie.I really like the father-son scenes in which they talk about everything and Mason gets advices from his father. They talked about movies like star wars if there's a possibility of it to another one and that happened too, what they predicted in 2008 that came true!!, brilliant. Excellent achievement of the director and how realistic the movie is,what a potential remains in the movie! 12 year project doesn't or couldn't contain some top rated actors especially the theme character,Mason. Coltrane was a risky, unpredictable one. I can't say he did that great as the movie deserves but It was such a great risk if the main character would have failed! But he did well not like the growing characters of harry potter movies but OK for the slow soothing unpredictable 12 years project. Various changes in a decade can happen! That altered number of changes to Mason, in her character, attitude. Except him even in our life cool electronics stuffs like no one uses the old phones or old vintage saloon cars new smartphones and beautiful cars are everywhere. His dad finally sells his Pontiac GTO although he loves that! There's something called emotional attachment, kids are like that! Especially kids are attached, so Mason stared a horrible perplexed look at his dad's most loved car when he sold that so he could by a new car for his son when he turns to 16. Again, a baffled look while her mother meets the professor, Bill and talks like she's getting attached to him Why does that happen? Doesn't dad love his mom, but its the responsibility the capability that control's you and like every creatures on the earth human too get attached to those who can give them a better environment and then what happens? Nothing! Life goes on. This is the most important essence the movie stands upon. Nothing really happens in the movie. His mom then gets married to another guy till she stands upon her own feet becomes what she wanted to be and then in the ends she asks what shall happen to her, she sacrificed most of his life for her kids and in the end what happens to her? Of course, the answer is nothing. But 2hr 45min can be really boring if you're not that into drama movies or even if you are you can still feel it because of this boring but true factor 'nothing'. There isn't anything in the storyline to be entertained or inspiring but the direction and the labour in the movie, the time it took the pain isn't that possible for every directors. Its a new style a unique and significant one of movie direction. That's what everyone loves about. The story isn't epic rather boring, the actors aren't that great rather unknown, the movie is what that everyone's life is about, nothing but the project is fascinating yet magnificent by Richard Linklater."
BOYHOOD,12 May 2017,10/10,"We hear Coldplay's ""Yellow"", a song from 14 years prior, as we see a boy lying in the grass staring up at the sky - something familiar. Moments like these are sewn throughout ""Boyhood"". Small fleeting moments that wouldn't be shown in any other movie because they would slow the story down and be removed in place of an action scene or a romance that doesn't quite belong.""Boyhood"" formally chronicles the life of a boy, Mason, from his youth until his high school graduation. Richard Linklater, a virtuoso in dialogue and the development of believable, human characters, created the film by shooting parts during the summer times of twelve years - a wonderfully unique way of showing genuine growth and the changes that can and do occur in anyone's, but in this case, Mason's life.What makes ""Boyhood"" excel and go beyond its interesting period of development is its attention to detail, attention to the world we all lived in during those years, regardless of our ages. In these years of Mason's aging, we hear things about ""The Dark Knight"" being in theaters, we see Halo being played, and we see Mason and his dad talking about what the state of the ""Star Wars"" universe may be. ""Boyhood"" has this interesting way of encapsulating the dozen years it was filmed in each of its scenes, yet it all works perfectly as a whole.""Boyhood"" on its face value is very interesting, but it's the small moments caught on camera and the words written for the actors that extend it to being an achievement. One of the greatest honors one could give to a bit of writing is the material's way of feeling real, that's what's in ""Boyhood"". While it's about Mason, his friends, and his family, its grasp extends beyond that. By showing the life events and the time periods, there's at minimum one thing from ""Boyhood"" that will reel you in and make you recall bits from your past in the forms of things you said to your parents, moments you had with your friends, to even whole chapters in your life.Realistic characters have been brought to life since movies were made, but not in recent memory have we seen several chapters of life be chronicled, and so believably. ""Boyhood"" is a delight for its entire 165 minute run-time (which doesn't run at all too long) due to the flawless portrayals of its characters by Ethan Hawke as Dad, Patricia Arquette as Mom, and Ellar Coltraine as Mason."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2014,10/10,"Boyhood embodies greatness. It inspires and exhilarates. It is poignant and uplifting. Boyhood celebrates life like no other and examines its often obscure meaning.The film chronicles the fictional life of Mason from age five to eighteen. The plot follows his coming to age and the turmoil it often brings. This film is unique when it comes to story telling because it was filmed over the course of twelve years. This allows the film makers to experiment like no other and exemplifies to its audience the real time that passes in between scenes. You watch as Mason matures and you develop a deep connection with him that is almost universally unrivaled by other films. I became so engrossed in his character that the nearly three hour run time felt like mere minutes.Boyhood is brimming in high quality. Richard Linklater directed this film flawlessly. His direction highlights the emotion of the film and projects life into it's characters. Linklater's screenplay also perplexes the characters and is filled with memorable dialog and subtle wisdom. The combination of these elements defines the film and its soul. The assembled cast is also top notch. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette star, and newcomer Ellar Coltrane plays the title role of Mason. The chemistry between the actors is unmatched and it only continues to evolve as the film progresses.Boyhood is a celebration of life, from its triumphs to it's heartbreak. It inspires us to live and as the film so eloquently put it ""let the moment size you"". Boyhood instills its soul into every frame. It teaches us that life worth living. It shows us that beauty is all around us and we simply just have to let go to experience it. Boyhood is unlike anything that has proceeded it and likely unlike anything that will follow. It is revolutionizing in every sense of the word and is undeniably the best film (thus far) this year and possibly of this decade. I can not urge you enough to experience this monumental piece of art."
BOYHOOD,25 December 2014,1/10,"I had high hopes for this movie after the Golden Globe nomination and following this boy for years, but I don't think there is any message. Other than... kids go through hard times with parents and changes. He had 2 parents who loved him and he didn't want for anything so I didn't really see any struggles other than the 2 stepfathers, for a time. I was so boring at times I though of turning it off. I kept thinking it'd get better and I do love Patricia Arquette. I fell asleep and I thought I'd try again the next day thing it would liven up, but it did not. Not worth wasting your time watching. It was interesting watching him in the different phases of his growing up, but I don't see what might make him different than any regular kid for people to want to watch. I wish the mother and father characters had been more thoroughly developed."
BOYHOOD,28 August 2014,7/10,"I gave this film a 7 on the merit of Linklater's monumental effort. Doing a time-lapse movie on this scale in unique. Unfortunately, there's nothing much in the plot-less story to keep your interest for nearly 3 hours.It's merely the growing pains of a rather introverted kid from 6 to 18. Yet, he's so dull most of the time, after a lively start, that the interesting people are his parents, played by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, as a mother who seems destined to pick men far below the caliber of ex husband, Hawke. Yet even here, there is no warmth or emotion between the two. They seem to be strangers.It's important is a film of this sort to have clear transition scenes from one or more years to another. These were missing throughout. You didn't know how old the kids had become most of the time. And the mother's last husband just disappeared without notice.I have to say Boyhood dramatically doesn't come near Linklater's Before Sunrise trilogy."
BOYHOOD,8 February 2015,8/10,"I wasn't sure if I would like this movie, but the the Oscar ceremony intrigued me.But I was surprisingly happy to see the movie growing in to my own personal feelings of my own boyhood, even without the bad experience he had.Very catching movie, some maybe long moment which could have been cut but appreciated it.Characters are interesting and growing and evolving with the movie so it did not get boring.In general, I gave a 8 score has while I enjoyed it, I am not sure how many times I will in a life time."
BOYHOOD,14 May 2015,10/10,When I first heard of this movie it was 5 years ago. It was still in production. Boyhood tells the story of young Mason. A young boy living with his sister and single divorced mother. This movie takes us from a young boy though the hell of growing up. With only seeing you wild free father every other weekend. And the hell of living with step fathers. This is a true coming of age story. We really get to grow up with this kid. You fill his pain though his eyes. There is no sad endings here. Which I was waiting to happen. Its a great drama for all ages. I would tell my own worst enemy to see this movie. So if your in the mood for a great drama. Go rent this movie. Hell buy this movie
BOYHOOD,12 August 2014,7/10,"Boyhood is less of a movie, and more of an experience. It's an experience meant to take you on exactly what the title entails, your boyhood; but as the credits rolled I felt as if there were a lot of missed opportunities. Times where I feel like they should of shown more explanation, more experiences but obviously these things don't keep it from being a good film whatsoever. The characters aren't super extraordinary but it is refreshing to watch them grow through their phases, it is more or less growing up than Boyhood as the actual boy who's growing up is a very dull character. The soundtrack is really nice but I just feel as if it's unfinished and that there should of been a lot more shown, despite the run time already being nearly three hours. This movie is being critically appraised and well it definitely does deserve that for taking the time to come out with this, there are still things I feel that they should have added, or at least thought about. Richard is a great director, but it doesn't really shine through in this film, there are some sequences that just feel awkward and feel as if they should have spent more time on them, especially with the massive time frame of the film. It's not a bad movie by any means, and I did enjoy that."
BOYHOOD,2 January 2015,10/10,"Boyhood is a call to life, it happens that we are immersed in everyday situations and not stop to think how our world is constantly changing and soon we realize. Boyhood calls this reflection in a simple manner evoking the simplicity of life and how it becomes to find ways to maturity.Time and patience are combined, and after 12 years of filming we see an impeccable staging. Just for the challenge, Linklater, deserves a standing an ovation. Using a Filming resources was an ambitious project, keep motivated the cast until the end, and during that time achieving cohesion is impressive.The role of a struggling mother, a thoughtful father keeps us glued to the screen until the end. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, give us part of managing these characters, becoming just as their children are growing with time."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,9/10,"This movie is in fact a masterpiece. Since I shouldn't use the word 'perfect', I guess calling it a 'masterpiece' is the next best. I won't lie though, to some it may be the most boring 165mins of a movie. However, avid movie fans who can appreciate pure drama are in for a treat. Don't get me wrong, this is not like an art-house film. It has its fair share of comedic and sad moments. Just that anything flows so smoothly to the point some people find it monotonous. But, I feel that is the beauty of the movie. In brief, the movie got their stuff right. Everyone acted well(including the calefares and especially Patricia Arquette), dialogue was good, great storyline... Being a drama, there wasn't much action in this movie. The most extreme thing that happened was probably Mason's violent stepfather smashing a glass. There wasn't anyone getting a sudden heart attack, getting into a car accident or even dying. Even amongst Dramas, this is unique. It gives us a very normal lifestyle of a boy growing up. This doesn't mean there aren't complications though. There are troubles the boy faces like a normal person, but the movie doesn't dramatise any of them. It simply flows through his life, showing the different phases of life people face. Not just the boy, but his parents and sister too. This is the beauty of the movie. No exaggeration. No harping on small or big problems. It just moves on, like life does. It really is a great unique experience watching the cast grow up. How the young mischievous children mature, how relationships come in play, mixing with different sorts of friends, phones start coming into their lives,going off to college... These may sound boring at first but the way the movie played it out was brilliant. It doesn't prompt you much when they're bringing out a point. You just gotta learn to be sensitive enough to realise it. And when you do realise and acknowledge it, it immediately brings back memories of your own life. When the scene of Mason in his young stage receiving attention from a girl, and yet giving her mindless replies, it immediately brought me back to the time whereby I first interacted with girls and how tactless I was. Unlike blockbusters such as the dark knight, you don't get the blood rushes when watching the movie. No build up no climax. Such movies reaches for the attention, but this film reaches for your heart. The movie imbues in you a great impression of it that will be remembered for life. After all, like what the director said, Life is beautiful.' Life itself is beautiful and this movie bear's testimony to that. At the start of the movie, you see two cute kids and a really busy stressed out Mom. At the end you see a grown up lady who can care for herself, a grown up man with moustache and a mom who now feels so free yet still emotionally unstable(and has put on quite some weight). The experience and feel the movie provides is like no other, For me, it made me reflect upon my own life and realise how much I've changed. Some may wish for more events and drama in it, but I feel what gives this movie its purity is its simplicity. It puts life on a plate for you to enjoy. The way the movie ended was great too(though the second half of the movie was more depressing), with the saying"" you don't seize the moment, the moment seizes you"". Lastly, I'll reiterate the fact that this movie epitomises the saying,' life is beautiful.' Though this movie is't the sort you'll pop at a party, its the sort that comes to your mind when someone asks you what are the most memorable movies you've watched. A true deserving Oscar best picture winner."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,5/10,"I'm writing this at the two thirds mark of a very long film, mainly out of sheer boredom. The film starts well enough but the acting of the lead boy deteriorates as he ages and the character becomes more and more dull. Watching hours of some mumbling kid does not make for good entertainment. Patricia Arquette is good in the earlier scenes when she has some drama to get her teeth into but basically does nothing much for most of the remainder of the film. Ethan Hawke puts in a good turn as the caring but mainly absent father. Overall a bit of a disappointment after all of the acclaim."
BOYHOOD,28 April 2018,5/10,"(Minor spoilers possible)The worst part of the movie was for me probably the ending, as it was open-ended and I feel like many of the lifelines demanded a stronger closure. Especially the protagonist's sister's life got left out of the story starting halfway.It had a potential esp. thanks to the longterm recording, but the main idea isn't quite there. What this movie does right at places is leading us through the contrast of how people change through growing up and how exactly the situations change around them. The characters felt flat at times (the mid part gets us the most involved) and towards the end even out of nowhere nihilistic, which struck me as overdone at places.
I must say I loved the part with the teacher about the art giving him the waking-up call.The movie ends as the protagonist enters the college and I feel like it could've been better if they just waited for him to enter the stage of a working adult (how did his career and personal life turns up after everything he's gone through, hm?)So all in all, watch for the minor events that show life contrasting during different periods while growing up, but be ready for rather a slow movie with boring passages and mediocre ending."
BOYHOOD,6 October 2019,1/10,"I can't believe this movie was made and presented, I had to turn it off, how could it be about nothing at all, and follow the most boring lives of the most boring people ever."
BOYHOOD,23 August 2017,7/10,"Labor, thoughts and methods of implementation, different things can emerge, just as they are in the film. For a certain patience for 12 years, even if it is accomplished by work discipline, deserves admiration. In this time frame, the shooting was completed in 45 days in total. As well as the fancy movements that should be considered too much, Based on a certain realism. We are able to analyze certain things in social sense while watching an ordinary family life. Instead of pointing at a spot and going over it, it places all the characters in order and simply. that we are beyond the ordinary Hollywood dream, taking the life of an American family of modest. You can see how things have changed as individuals period along with this idea of ​​being dragged towards the youth from childhood shots, you can catch the ways in which people grasp the chance to be dragged. In short, there are plenty of parts where you can find and feel something from yourself. The marriage only establish direct relations with the main focus being liked by people that every step in the destruction reveals.As a result of this submission of the year waiting period in a time zone three hours giving a uniform appearance in terms of fiction. Although it is a drama taste, it is also certain that it has its own peculiarity with the help of frequent stage passages. The criticism of the political and political order of the United States does not escape attention. Barack Obama's admiration is also expressed; He became home favorite movie in 2014."
BOYHOOD,29 June 2017,10/10,"I recently saw this movie this past week and expected not a lot. I had skipped it back in 2014 because of all the negative reviews. I am very glad my girlfriend told me to see this. This movie moves you. It starts out with Mason (Coltrane), as a young kid. He goes through life as a normal boy; school, moving, parents divorce, love, and college.There were incredible performances in this film. Eller Coltrane as Mason was great. Patricia Arquette was phenomenal, deserving of the Oscar for best supporting actress, and Ethan Hawke was amazing as well. It is a shame that the average Birdman beat this astonishing 12-Year masterpiece for best picture. Richard Linklater hit it out of the park on this one. Don't believe the ""Nothing happened"", ""Waste of Time"" reviews. Watch it for yourself!"
BOYHOOD,28 May 2021,10/10,"I feel sad for people who don't get the greatness about this movie. Time, childhood, parenting, adulthood are the plot. It touches me in multiple aspects."
BOYHOOD,27 June 2021,10/10,"So smooth, fake-free, and at ease. Exactly what I needed. The plot was time and the dialogues were so deep."
BOYHOOD,16 November 2018,,"Anyone who has seen any work from Richard Linklater knows what kind of a filmmaker he is. He waited between years to complete his ""Before"" trilogy and with Boyhood he has gone a step further and actually filmed the actor in real time. The real time extent here is a staggering 18 years and the coming of age aspect is enhanced by this fact alone. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play the parents of the lead and the young actors, especially Ellar Coltrane is exceptional. This is a must watch for all cinema lovers."
BOYHOOD,7 January 2015,1/10,"I usually don't comment on movies I didn't like, but after seeing the rating of this movie, I couldn't stop myself. The only interesting thing about this movie is, that it was shot over 12 years. Considering that the whole movie was shot on 45 days, they filmed about 4 days each year. That alone tells you a lot about this movie. The director didn't do anything special. And the story is boring. Nothing happens. Movies are supposed to give the audience some kind of emotions. To feel sad, excited, to be scared or to laugh. None of that happens. This movie is a total waste of time. Take a look out of your window and watch birds fly or people walk by is more exciting believe me. I wouldn't even give this movie 1 star, but there is nothing less available."
BOYHOOD,12 February 2015,9/10,"Recently i've forgone watching American movies - we got principally trashy, worthless movies including super hero films, cheesy comedies or movies which preferred spectacle instead story.So it's rare to find a treasure like this, but the double of Linklater and Ethan Hawke always has guaranteed the quality - and this work doesn't disappoint us. The unusual way it was shot (during 12 years with the same actors who were playing perfectly) I found amazing and it made the film more authentic. The story goes slowly forward, but it permits of the elaboration of characters and acts. It's really sensible and everyone can find the similarities with his own life. Highly recommend!"
BOYHOOD,9 July 2020,1/10,It's honestly just really boring and a complete waste of time. I just couldn't wait for it to end.
BOYHOOD,7 June 2021,9/10,"Although centred on Mason, the genius is that all the characters age. This made me reflect on the fact that mum and dad were 25 years younger when they had me, and have laughed, cried and changed for the same amount of time as me.You can't watch this movie and not reflect on your own mortality, the next 18yrs will fly by, how will you think of them? Is what I'm doing now what I want to be doing, or is it somehow leading up to that thing? (Do I even know what I want to be doing at all?)A must watch."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2015,1/10,"Oh. My. God. It was so bad we were laughing at the end. A crashing bore. And terribly long. And dull. Yes, it was an interesting concept to film the kids growing up, but that was it. The characters were so bland. Parts of it showed the kids in abusive situations which was the only emotion I felt during this insipid movie and it just felt bad. I am a militant feminist and even I thought the way the men were portrayed in the film was offensive. Then to add insult to injury, the first husband was an unsuccessful musician and they would play his crappy songs and you had to listen to them. The only thing that would have made it worse was if I spilled my soda on my seat and was sitting in a wet chair. How this was nominated for an Oscar I have no idea. I like to see all the films before the Oscars are handed out. I thought it would be an interesting character driven story. No. I could not have cared less about any of these boring people. Worse Oscar-Nominated film ever. And best supporting actress nomination to Arquette? Please. Marion Ross from Happy Days could have played this role. Save your money and your time. I was never so happy to see the credits roll in my life."
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,10/10,"This film traces a boy's life over the course of 12 years, and was actually shot over that same time, so the actors are the same, and you see the kids grow up and all lives evolve. It was so natural and well acted, so based in reality, that you forget it's a movie and you think you are a friend or neighbor watching a home movie about people you know.If you are looking for drama or a plot or action or impactful ending, this is not your film. Some will find it boring, but if you approach it with no expectations except to get to know the characters, you will see people you know, even in your own family. It is heartening to see that every family has issues and challenges, even the ones who look perfect from the outside, and that even the good kids go through stuff and can be okay in the end. Bravo."
BOYHOOD,18 July 2015,2/10,"When I start watching a movie, I usually finish it. I give a lot of attention to the movie choice and so, what I watch is usually at least mediocre. In this case, the whole concept didn't look too appealing, but this is such a huge hit at the critics that sometimes you just have to go with the flow. Something with scores this high cant be bad? Can it?Oh god, it can. I managed to watch like 25 minutes of this overrated mess of a movie. All the characters are very unsympathetic I literally hated everyone. This is what a family is like? Im honestly concerned about Americans if this is true. These are family fights? Really? Are they all on drugs or something. If every parent was like these guys, well. Lets just say that a zombie apocalypse could hold the answer. This movie is only for Americans, a weak drama with degenerate family-concept and very bad characters. The only one I could support was Ethan Hawke. Don't give something a high vote only because its acclaimed by critics. The start of the movie is unbearable, by the 25 minute it became just bad, so I finished it on a high note.I almost never write reviews on IMDb, but this movie p**** me off. Horrible."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,2/10,"This item looks like a made-for-TV moral fable and might have been a 1983 plot about single moms. ""Mom"" is the all-suffering, nice, blond, articulate and heroically single mom. She's a lady raising two kids who howls at how meaningless it all is. Although real people don't talk in pat and formulaic sentences, Mom does: ""I want to know who I am,"" she intones; ""I went from being 'somebody's daughter' to 'somebody's wife'."" Cue the flutter from Betty Friedan.Mom is what we'd we'd expect in a moral fable: wise and thoughtful and unbreakable. So is her daughter, Samantha, a girl whose name can be masculinized to de-emphasize her original girlishness. So the film calls her Sam. This adds a soupçon of transgendering, very trendy.The boy – ostensibly the topic of this movie – is just a kid. In fact, in this film, he's nothing at all, just a foil for feminist ruminations.Mom has made the mistake of walking out on her first husband. Well, he's artistic, smokes dope, and doesn't have a steady job. For that, breadwinner Mom cuts him out. When hubby comes to call, she tries hard to not let him in.Next, she goes back to school in order to ""know who I am."" There, she falls for the next available male caricature, the Power Abuser. This predictable item comes as a psychology professor who isn't so much a professor as a predator looking to hook up with co-eds.Despite being preternaturally wise, Mom marries him. Well, we know how that's gonna end. Not only is the prof a sexual predator, he's also a drunk and a wife-beater.At that point they were still focused on the all-wise Mom and I walked out. Friends told me later it got worse and went nowhere. The film has a deceptive title; a more accurate one would be Momhood, Whatever."
BOYHOOD,18 August 2014,1/10,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I was anxious to just get lost in the story as this boy would grow from age 6-18. Unfortunately there wasn't much of a story to get lost in. Although I never left the theatre, it seemed like I had taken 4-5 bathroom breaks and missed some fairly important plot connections. This movie should have either been a lot longer and much more detailed or a lot shorter and maybe included a plot, because what we got was a seemingly random yet chronological assortment of scenes that tell a rushed summary of 12 years of life. Secondary characters were quickly thrown into the story and then forgotten, almost as fast as I could figure out what year it was supposed to be. Good music and a good cast are the reasons behind my 5/10, but in all the story left a lot to the imagination. Just when it appeared something meaningful was happening, it would fast forward a couple of years. The long awaited conclusion was drawn out and still abrupt, leaving me feeling flat and unsatisfied. I guess there is a reason most movies aren't filmed over a 12 year period and include a plot... Major disappointment."
BOYHOOD,4 May 2015,9/10,"What is good about this movie is not why it was so critically acclaimed. I personally think that the fact that it was filmed over the course of 12 years is relatively negligible. The only benefit that it added was that you had a very clear aging process of a kid rather than jumping around between different actors like in Slumdog Millionaire. I think that what was so great about this movie was the perspective from which it was shot. From the beginning of the movie you have the main character at a young age, not really understanding why they were leaving his father too much but generally understanding that they were going to be entirely different after they left. And what you see throughout the rest of the movie is the progression that the main character goes through as he learns what causes different life experiences and how his views of the world change. He and his friends aren't members of every other movie where Murphy's Law comes into effect. They throw saw blades at a wall and no one gets killed, he has a discussion with his dad about texting and driving and he doesn't get in a crash, he drinks, smokes, and does drugs like a vast number of young kids today and it doesn't really affect him much. He is a product of divorce and that wears on him more than anything. From learning the cruelties of love and relationships through his mother's failed marriages, to watching true happiness and commit take hold of his childish father, you watch this young man change and grow into something many people can relate to. However, the best part of this movie is that it is truly filmed from his eyes. While the movie is about him, it's not. It's about his life, him growing, him experiencing different things, him meeting new people, and his mindset changing. His life is more about what is happening around him than the singular narrative that is going on in his head and that is the part that I believe was most successful with this movie."
BOYHOOD,27 January 2015,3/10,"I can't think what the hype's all about. Sure it's neat that the 5-yr-old is the same actor as the 18-yr-old. But that's been done by Michael Apted and his was a documentary and completely enthralling. There was something of the ""documentary"" to this over-long movie. The acting by the principals looked at times like it was ad-libbed - is that supposed to be good? Ellar Coltrane managed to hold his own throughout the film, demonstrating the typical feelings one would expect from a boy at a given age. But even still his performance was frequently stilted. 'Ethan Hawke was one of the few believable characters. Patricia Arquette was Patricia Arquette as directed by Woody Allen, to my mind! And I'm not a fan of Allen....Perhaps if you're a growing boy, or a man who's gone through the process from boyhood to manhood, this would be an intriguing film. Personally I thought it was tedious and I was appalled when I saw I still had an hour and half to go at the half-way mark! ""Ho hum"" comes to mind when I think of this film. It really felt like a waste of three hours."
BOYHOOD,28 September 2014,7/10,"I have seen this movie in cinema and luckily for me they had a break because it's a long movie. It's a story of a boy named Mason whom later turns into a spoiled teenager. The first part of the movie (the part when they where younger) was much more interesting than the last part, The last half hour was almost painful to watch, when Mason discovers his talent for photography. His character developed into a 'creative deep thinking' guy which did not suited him.The movie is well acted and it contains a detailed storyline, I sure admire the dedication to make a movie that took 12 years to finish."
BOYHOOD,21 October 2015,10/10,"Since 2002, each year the director shot the four actors - a boy named Allan Coltrane, his daughter Lorelei Linklater and longtime friends, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. It lasted 12 years - six years old Mason, Jr. (the name of the main character) before his eighteenth birthday. Older sister and their divorced parents grew up with him. The project developed gradually, organically - not a distinct structure of the screenplay, but rather as a series of improvisations quietly change the life and destiny of the characters. Too minor enough, new husbands mom and dad's girl, friends and classmates, boyfriends and girlfriends sister Mason. From this was born the monumental - but, here's the paradox, immersed in the small household items, if any Tolstoy's novel - the film Linklater. The picture is not just about how a boy from a grown man, but also about growing up American. About nostalgia and destruction. The hopes and disappointments. About love and indifference. The fact that every child - a personality, and every adult - the child.All this probably sounds too generally, but the charm of «Boyhood» in the fact that it is pointless to repeat. Firstly, it is better to try and go through each phase of maturation of the hero himself. Secondly, the words are not as important as random, involuntary gestures, facial expressions and tone of subtlety. Everything that enters the lens Mason chosen profession photographer - to catch the fleeting moments captured his memory and Linklater folded into a single movie. Among them there is no serious injury, not a single plot turn: first school fight and the first sex, the first sip of alcohol and first betrayal not shown. Before us - a fascinating daily life, not a series of events, but the intervals between events. Perhaps that is why life on the screen - this is real, and dramatic time, which changes the characters (and actors) for a record long shooting period, work effectively every effort, most ingenious, make-up artist.All together, it looks like a spontaneous crusade against planetary инфантилизм. But Linklater in his «Boyhood» achieves the artistic scale, without coming down to schematics. He makes a series of sketches in trifling immensely wide mural - a guide to the inner world of the fictional, but real people and striking portrait of the modern world at the same time. And she ambition and execution, and even intonation bring together director with another chronicler of modern America - the author of ""Freedom"" and ""corrections"" Jonathan Franzenom. With the only difference that to achieve such a biological miracle, as the gradual growing of the film along with his heroes, can only cinema."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,10/10,"It will be sometimes that we need to change our point of view to the things that happen around us.Sometimes it can be easy to do this work but unfortunately we think that It will be hard.Among all of the people all over the world there are guys who made this impossible thoughts,possible.Richard Linklater is one of these persons. When he decided to start his project with an unfamiliar name,'Boyhood',it was hard even for his project's casts to think about the success of the project,because the idea on his mind was to make a film over12 years which was a hard decision because it could be terminated by each kind of unwanted accidents,but Linklater did this work and showed another time that everything can be possible if you want to do something.Boyhood is a normal drama movie which is at first seems to be like a documentary but the way of narrating its story which is one of the strangest kinds of narrating on nowadays movies makes this movie a kind of masterpiece;its strange because we don't want to face a story of a normal movie, we want to watch a movie which is related to the life of a young boy from childhood to adolescence.Its hard!but Linklater did this job perfectly.Lets see the time when the story wants to show us the difference made by time in the relationship between a mom and her children,lets look at the scene of the movie when the writer wants to show us that he knows exactly what are the problems and what are the sensations of the boys not only in the time they are only10years old but also in the time they are18years.Absolutely,in my opinion the turning point of the story is the time that the director and also a writer of this movie put the half length time of the movie to the time when the mom marry for the second time after her separation.Look at the incomparable way of mentioning all of the problems that this kind of children will be face with.Look at the time when the children must see their real father on holidays and the way of their connection with their dad and also look at so many other things that happen on this period of the story.Absolutely boyhood, based on its subject, tells a story and its better to say show us a kind of story which can teach us many things and also the story can help us to experience something that we may have never experienced or can remind us our delightful moments of our childhood or adolescence.About the casts performances there will be no word remains ;An outstanding performance by Patricia Arquette ,An acceptable and memorable way of playing by Ethan Hawke and also the other good performances by the other casts from the grandmother to the Mindy ;their performances and the relaxed way of playing they have, can suggest you that all the things happen in the movie, is real and this is exactly what that was placed on the mind of the writer ,so another time what I said on the previous lines can be use as a proof for the nice method the writer has used to tell the story and makes it believable.Editing of this movie is a kind of achievement too.putting parts together, the parts which are filmed on 12years,choosing the best possible way of editing for this movie helps this title seems completely believable and also memorable piece of art of cinema ,this is not a job can be done by a normal editor and because of this in my opinion Sandra Adair,the editor of this flick, is one of the cinema's most genius editors.After all of these reasons I mentioned(and I haven't forgotten to talk about the director,I have said nothing because I think when I told you about his courage of making this film and also the way he has written the screenplay I mentioned his ability and if I intend to tell something about the way he directed this movie my review would become inefficient)Boyhood is one of the movies which soon mention everywhere as one of the biggest projects of the cinema's history .believe it or not it's a masterpiece and for those who insists on their belief that this movie is just a different boring drama movie I suggest them to watch it again and again and they will understand this fact ;and don't forget that the budget of making this movie is only 4000000dollars!and among the blockbusters and stylish movies of these days ,it should have something new to be mentioned as one of the year's best movies .Thank you all for reading my review ;I wish it became useful to all of you.Sincerely Yours,Amin Ghanbari"
BOYHOOD,13 June 2021,,"Filmed over the course of 12-years the film follows the same characters (and actors!) as they grow up. Exceptional project which shows the mundane and not so mundane parts of parenthood, coming of age, love and drama with realistic dialogue and good acting. Disliked only the depiction of the always-messing-up mother and the funny-cool-guy-caring father, which was too shallow, stereotypical, idealizing."
BOYHOOD,16 September 2014,3/10,"The only thing that pushed me to watch the film is the fact that it was ""filmed for over 12 years with the same cast"". Well, that's really spectacular, cause it really shows the growth of the characters, especially Mason, on screen.Unfortunately, I was so bored that I had to fast forward scenes and eventually stop watching it. It is just so dull and plain for me. There's nothing so special about this film other than it was filmed for more than a decade.However, I still give it a 3/10 for the effort of, again, filming for more than 12 years."
BOYHOOD,7 March 2015,7/10,"When reading the reviews, this film caught my interest, because the reviews were either crap or a masterpiece, and almost nothing in between.Now I have seen it myself and I think those who called this film crap did not see all the film. The first half an hour of Boyhood is pretty dull, but the film grows on you, and the last two hours is pretty good. The dialogue is not very original, but the structure of the film is pretty amazing. The fact that you follow the characters for so many years, also in real life, not just on film, makes you want to know more about them."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,1/10,"This movie is supposed to be a movie about life but Life is more exiting than that!! If life were as boring and messed up as represented in the movie the rate of suicides would be much much higher. As I watched this movie I expected something to happen, but nothing ever did... It is as if this movie was intended to make people depressed, even the main actor, that weird male version of Kirsten Stewart looked depressed (and is it just me, or he couldn't articulate properly? extremely irritating). You'd think that 12 years is enough time for someone to make a masterpiece, hahaha as stated on the title: I've seen commercials more exciting than that movie. I don't think it deserved any Oscar nominations. The acting wasn't particularly good, excepting the father, he was the only character that didn't look depressed. The story didn't have a plot or anything. The movie is as pointless as a circle. To IMDb: why is the rating so high?!?!? 8.2, seriously???? this movie makes me wish there was a 0 star rating, well i guess they can get one star for the effort. I normally trust IMDb ratings and check them for every movie i ever intend to watch; however, this rating is waaaayyyy too high for one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. It is almost insulting how this movie can be amongst movies like the Godfather, Goodfellas, The Lord of the Rings, Inception... movies that are actually good, interesting to watch and a good conversational topic. I seriously don't understand this rating, out of all the friends and family members that have seen this movie, no one has said anything good about it. I tend to be positive, but this movie is a serious wast of time."
BOYHOOD,17 November 2014,7/10,"I won't talk about film much but target audience in detail.This movie is definitely a work of art. But for people who can not relate to the movie, it will definitely be a drop off.I am saying this because I saw many people leaving theater in between movie in India. Mostly because they could not understand the lifestyle and life events shown in Movie.Not all can relate to this great flick which was shot with lot of care and has very good screenplay. Story of a Boy, his struggles, life changing events and purpose of life. Everything is captured very well and put on screen in a very brilliant manner.Movie progresses in slow pace showing what exactly a American Boy would have gone through if born in 90s.People with rough childhood will find it good too.Must watch for unique way of filming and experiment."
BOYHOOD,28 December 2014,2/10,"**********************************Spoiler Alert***********************This is a ""film about nothing,' to paraphrase the old Seinfeld joke. The film chronicles the life of a young man, his sister and divorced parents through 12 years of ordinary existence. These folks are no different from countless other people everyone has seen go through 12 years of life. Nothing really interesting or different happens to them. It's as if the director channeled George Costanza talking to Mr. Dalrymple at NBC, ""What did you do this morning?"" ""I got up, had coffee and came to work."" ""There's a movie, that's a movie!"" No, it's not.This film had no point nor point of view. None of the characters were particularly appealing. None had any interesting insights. At the end, the main character, supposedly high on mushrooms, queries, ""Do we seize the moment or does the moment seize us?"" That's the best he can do on mushrooms?The vast majority of ""critics,"" i.e. people smarter than me, loved this film because it teaches that life is fleeting and time slips through one's fingers. We don't know this? Apparently, we do because many ""ordinary people"" submitting reviews have been flummoxed by all the fulsome praise of this film."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2015,,"I tried to like this movie, I really did. But for the most part it was pretty boring. It was also way too long. And the liberal dad (Ethan Hawke) was a big turn off, putting up yard signs for the worst president in history - Barack Obama. They tried to portray a southern conservative gun owner but got it all wrong: ""Get off my lawn I can shoot you you know"" as he says it to a young boy. Really? Nobody does that especially to a kid.Anyways, not a complete waste of time watching this movie, but it's not really that great and defiantly not something you'd want to watch again."
BOYHOOD,3 March 2015,10/10,"I'll start by saying that Boyhood is the best movie of 2014 and it unfairly missed the best picture prize at the Oscars (birdman is pretty good, though, so I'm not that upset about it). Linklater has made some amazing movies throughout his diverse career, and though nothing he makes will ever top the sheer perfection and emotional power of ""Before Sunrise"", I can safely say that Boyhood is a nearly flawless masterpiece of epic proportions. Having said this, I have to say I don't understand all the negative reviews I've been reading in IMDb. I mean, how can people say there's nothing going on? That ""nothing happens""? Everything happens? How can anyone say it's boring? And everyone saying their childhoods were far more exciting that mason's? I don't understand. Do they mean they traveled a lot around the world, had amazing friends and some pets that died when they reached their teen years? I did all those things and loved my childhood, but can still see the beauty of a not so exciting but totally real life somebody else had. I do agree that ellar coltrane could have been a little bit more charismatic and I have to say that lorelei, while in some scenes pretty good, was cringe-worthy in some others. But at least they were fully developed. And the cast was lifted by ethan hawke and the so so so wonderful patricia arquette. She gave one of the most honest and real performances I've ever seen. Her character was so well developed and her final scene was devastating to watch. And the script, the direction, the soundtrack, all the cultural references, they all made this a totally unique and touching movie experience. I remember leaving the theatre and feeling so deeply moved by what I had just seen, and feeling this rush of adrenaline running through my veins. Because more than laughing or crying, ""Boyhood"" made me feel alive. If that's not the sign of an amazing movie, I really don't know what it is. Ultimately, I have to say I feel sorry for all the haters. Not because I consider myself superior to them, which I don't, but because I know they missed an unique experience... And hey, it's a gimmick, but I barely noticed it after a while. It's not a gimmick, it's life!"
BOYHOOD,17 April 2017,9/10,"As brought up in press relieves, this movie was shot during 12 years with the same actors, same cast and of course same director.Richard Linklater is a very respectable filmmaker but a suspicion that this movie could become about a depiction of a social experiment had arise. Right from the beginning this suspicion would fade out because we are watching a real movie, an excellent movie. It is the testimony of a span in a life experience not of Ellar Coltrane who we watch actually growing up but the story of Mason's early years in life. Few movies are so fixated in relating the developing of a character to his social and cultural environs as this is. In spite of an specific historic era individuals passing through elementary, middle and High school are committed sponges to absorb from both the academic and extracurricular modes but also from the subsidiary contacts and influences from parents, family (with many kind of dynamics), neighbors, blockbusters phenomena, meeting other students, bulling, boozing, body adornment, religious and political options, foreign wars and the rhetoric counseling that might or might not stay as a light where to base a happy future life. All these components are present in the movie but not in the sense that a context shaping an archetype representative of an era. Mason meets all these situations not as expected hurdles or lifts but with the naivety of uncertainty. We do not know totally what he is absorbing from these marks. It is a unique story. The acting is exceptional and the script provides a discourse that is real and defines characters naturally and with credibility. Arquette and hawke are wonderful as divorced Mason's parents. She as a single mom is overwhelmed with responsibility and still pushing for doing the right thing for her children. As such human person she is sometimes down. Hawke in the role of the distant parent is also human. We see his encounters with Sam and Mason as separated in time. The lack of continuity in parenting gives him guilt but he externalizes a face and a sound of confidence advising his children. It seems that he believes in his parent's position but he probably is aware of his shortcomings and recognizes his parent's work as not perfect but doing what he could within the given the circumstances. Atmosphere, acting and storytelling haves made this film very enjoyable. Richard Linklater made this movie work by combining the abundant and weighty elements in a chemistry of constrain and intelligence. The parallel growing up of Ellar and Mason was of great benefit for the film. Gave the viewers a knitted sense of History."
BOYHOOD,25 July 2014,8/10,"Where to begin with Boyhood? I wasn't sure what to expect when i went to watch this at the cinemas last night, as i had heard very little and not even seen a trailer... I was pleasantly surprised Don't get me wrong, its a far cry from the Hollywood blockbuster movies that are usually released about this time in the Summer and its also hard to categorise which genre this movie falls into..I'd suggest going to watch this on a Sunday afternoon when you have no other plans and fancy chilling out and having the ""feel good"" factor..It's really quite interesting seeing the same cast grow older together and watching how their lives change over time and their personalities develop it's easy to relate to the people in this film especially if your grew up in a similar era as most people will recognise themselves or people that they know.. I'd like to give Ethan Hawke a huge thumbs up on a superb job! I think if their is one lesson from this movie, its to just enjoy life and take everyday with a laid back approach and don't allow the little things in life to get you down."
BOYHOOD,13 August 2014,2/10,"They spent 12 years filming but no actual thought on the plot or ending. Afters 2 hours I finally realized this movie was never gonna get to a point or climax. And it ended with nothing. If you want to watch just to see the actors age and their acting improve then yes watch. But don't watch if you need a story, your not gonna get one here. It was basically a movie about a family, no happy ending no lessens learned, just life how it goes, super boring and slow. I think the producers could have given it an ending or a meaning of something or the kid learn a lesson or anything. But that didn't happen, it just ended."
BOYHOOD,9 June 2019,5/10,"Didn't resonate with me. I frankly regret watching this film, because fair or not, it actually makes me like Linklater's other work less - even Waking Life, which for years was my favorite movie. I think the main problem I had with the film was a perceived lack of conflict. The guy had a couple of stepdads who were jerks. But other than that, his boyhood went pretty smoothly - almost in an idyllic manner. I would have liked to see more struggles - say, with depression, unpopularity, etc. It would have made the film more compelling."
BOYHOOD,20 May 2020,8/10,"Simple and calm, to feel the passage of time. Only when we review the whole story can we find the wonderful and wonderful, just like the magic of time itself. It's like characters grow up in less than three hours without special effects or makeup. All of these are wonderful, like the original idea of the film, to compress time and retain the traces of time, so as to feel the wonder of life. When the boy starts again, it's not the end, it's a new beginning"
BOYHOOD,21 February 2015,4/10,"I'm sorry to say that I didn't find anything interesting in this movie and I have no clue as why it's nominated to an Oscar as a best movie. Yes, the movie has some interesting parts and reference to your daily life on the past 12 years, and you get the chance to remember some great songs (the only thing I really like on the movie). Some pieces of the movie looks very forced like when they are reading Harry Potter and then comes the movie and they are big fans of this and they goes to the movies.Is like watching 3 hours of the life of some common families in the US, nothing happens. Like Arquette said ""I was expecting more!!""The boy is a completed loser that can't accomplish anything and everything he does is half done, the mother falls one and another and another time with abusive men that have a lot of love for the drinking, the sister is a B****, that does nothing and gives nothing to the movie. The only person that does something good on acting and on his live on the movie is Ethan Hawke who give an excellent performance through the hole movie.I really recommend to stay away as far as you can from this movie. It's empty, boring and a wasted of a good 3 hours of your life."
BOYHOOD,25 August 2014,9/10,"I read a lot of raving reviews of this movie, so I had to check it out for myself. It did not disappoint. Of course the whole set up of this movie is unique. Portraying 13 years of Mason's, (family) life, filmed with the same actors over a period of 13 years. I thought it was marvelous. This movie shows what life is (or can be like) and even though my life was very different it really resonated. It made me realize how fast you grow up, how hard it is to be a parent. There were touching moments, funny ones and frightening ones (the abusive step dad). We see moments pass by, maybe not the moments you'd expect in a movie. The most dramatic moments happen off screen: wedding, births - we don't see these, but they provide a structure for the story. Maybe we don't see these moments because they are exceptional in human life. Director Linklater shows daily life: the rules, not the exceptions. This might be the reason why some people in the theater with me said 'it was boring' and 'nothing happens'. But that's where they're wrong in my opinion. The separate scenes, or moments in Mason's life, feel like they are in a natural flow. The editing is well done, also a great (nostalgic) soundtrack accompanies it. The most important themes of life arc all the different moments: love, friendship, loneliness, marriage, divorce, getting kids and grandkids, but mostly getting older. In the end this movie does not show Mason's life, or his parent's life, it shows human life in general. And that's why this movie should hit close to home for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're young or old, have kids or not. This movie makes you realize time passes quickly and that everyone thinks at some point in their lives: 'is this it, I thought there'd be more'. It makes me wanna listen to John Mayer's 'Stop this train', because sometime it just is ""scary getting older"". Boyhood gives us a beautiful image of humans in time. And it's well worth three hours of your time, i mean what are three hours in a lifetime?"
BOYHOOD,26 October 2014,1/10,"A not so unique mind that's responsible for polluting the world of cinema with an abomination that is the 'Before...' trilogy strikes again. By filming 2 child actors and 2 professional actors over the span of 12 years or so, Linklater has succeeded in producing a flick that's dramatically and cinematographic-ally equivalent to average TV movies. Contrary to what most naysayers have said about it, Boyhood is actually loaded with drama and sentimentalism instead of nothingness. The single mother, the unreliable father, the domestic violence, the divorces, the mother's plight in raising her two kids while attending college and finally getting a degree and becoming a teacher are some of the dramas that--as clichéd as they might be--could have been utilized as dramatic device. Yet, the forced banalization of these events by jumping ahead year after year without actually showing how the characters process them made them almost invisible and frankly posses little to no emotional impact. However, it's an admirable attempt to give the movie a touch of realism and accentuate how life could feel meaningless sometimes despite of the dramas that surround it. Still, Boyhood fails in making the events other than a few slides in a Power Point document for the reason mentioned before. Moreover, Linklater seems to realize this and tries to compensate it by forcefully including some laughable scenes that are intended to make viewers think that the characters' lives are anything but meaningless or boring. For instance, the scenes with the restaurant manager who thanks the mother for her advice looks too much like one of the scenes from insipid motivational movies. It's a sad effort to make us appreciate small victories in our everyday lives (not to mention quite condescending; as if the viewers are a bunch of emotionally and spiritually challenged individuals who have no ability to realize such sophomoric life insight). The last scene with the mother loosing her composure and starting rambling about how meaningless her life is (despite of the ups and downs and all of dramas she has experienced) just because her son is leaving for college reads like a desperate attempt from the director/writer to give a sense of climax and closure. Lastly, since the title of this flick is Boyhood and the premise is a deeper look into a boy's life from his perspective, Boyhood couldn't have been more distant in depicting the central character's inner turmoils. Well, it was probably quite a task since the Boy was so boring.1/10"
BOYHOOD,22 November 2014,10/10,"Never watched such realistic movie. Linklater has his different style of movie making, I don't know how describe his style but it's a kind of Linklaterian style. Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are all as realistic as our real life. Boyhood is like a real life. Never watched something like this before. We have seen it before that some kids grown up on screen by exchanging the characters. Bringing up as real boy is very unique. It has been a long journey of 13 years of shooting. I don't know if even anybody thought about this kind of an idea before.In years to come this movie will be a classic. It is true if Linklater would have changed the actors and make the movie in a month time then probably we would have been thinking so seriously about the movie. Actually we wait for 3 hours and nothing happens. Isn't it the same thing happen to us in our real life? People go to watch the theater to watch movie for recreation in general, so if a good actor can act better we applause, we talk about that movie. But as we keep watching the movie we understand someone from behind just pulling the thread. But the reason of liking the movie is it is so much about us. We are born with a lot of ignorance unknowings, but in time we learn. We learn from our experience. Linklater has tried to create a film of feeling, a feeling that is ever- so-common today but ever-so-rarely filmed. In many films today, about pseudo-conventional, white, middle-class Americans, their tragedies in life are given almost astrological significance within the confines of the film (Silver Linings Playbook, as an example).If we really want to enjoy the movie, we have to imagine ourselves as one of the character of the movie. Else it may get boring, it is a long story without much happening, like our real life. We don't jump from an airplane or travel with a starship."
BOYHOOD,9 May 2016,6/10,"I did rent this on BR and watched it over several days so I realize that is not the ideal viewing experience. Still, I was looking forward to this and was disappointed. I have seen previously two of the ""Before..."" series by the director and found them to be charming. But what works in a constrained time frame did not work for me in this coming of age story. The story is routine and meandering like much of life, but I prefer a more artful rendering. The 12 years of filming sounds so audacious but is actually just a stunt. So I was not engaged with the characters or the plot. I normally check out the ""features"" on a BR but skipped them for this film."
BOYHOOD,21 September 2014,9/10,"I was really curious about ""Boyhood"" since I have first heard about it. Also I am almost in the same age as the main character, Mason, so I felt that is really a film for me. It seemed very unique and I had great expectations about the film. Because of that, I was scared, that I will be disappointed after watching it. So, on a day when there was no school, one day after the premiere in my country, I went and watched this 165 minutes long film. Fortunately my expectations were fulfilled. It was beautiful.The idea is brilliant, I am happy, that finally I have seen something really original. The actors were great (I think the best one might have been Patrica Arquette), the dialogs were very natural. It was really intimate and human.I think the right content rating should be 16+. From that age, you can probably understand the movie but if you are under that and you would like to watch it, I recommend you to wait. In this film we can have a look at how Mason's (the main character boy) personality develops from the first grade until he goes to collage. Yes, it's not the most exciting movie plot of all time but I didn't feel time despite the fact that I have mentioned, that I have been sitting in a chair for 165 minutes. I have read in a review that it is bad because the boy doesn't go through any spectacular, ultra-dramatic experience. Yes, it is true, he doesn't. This film is beautiful exactly because of that. It could be the life of anybody. Hearing your parents argue when you were a kid. Got bullied for no reason. Having talks and getting important advices from your father. Being full of doubts as a teenager. And who didn't have that ""dark-room"" speech from somebody when he was a teen? Sounds familiar doesn't it? The thing, that makes this film beautiful is the same thing that makes life beautiful. Memories. Memories of our ordinary life."
BOYHOOD,12 November 2017,1/10,"SPOILER ALERT! It's awful. The fact that that it took 12 years to film would be much more impressive if they had filmed something worth watching. The 7 hour run time is a little much as well..........only 2 hours? Really? The Story itself lack any kind of substance. It's suppose to depict real life. Do you know what people don't want to see when they go to the movies? Real life! We have real life every day, we go to the movies to escape that. Also the mother is depicted as a needy desperate woman who marries two of the same man, with equally disastrous results. I think that plot device was to create sympathy for her but it just made her come off as desperate and stupid. There is no story arc. The film starts off with the same emotion as it ends and plays that same note through out the entire film. The novelty of the 12 year shoot quickly loses any meaning at all when nothing happens. How this film got nominated for anything is a mystery. Patricia Arquette winning best actress was the biggest mistake in the history of awards."
BOYHOOD,11 November 2014,10/10,"After finishing the movie I would say I was submerged into the ocean of gloominess. This is not a movie, it is a ""experience of a lifetime"". Maybe my heart was scattered into the pieces by the phenomenon called life. The movie penetrates through our hard interior and shows how much vulnerable and confused we are. How much we owe to love. It projects the ambivalent state where we bound to love our parents as long has have a dark hatred for them. The way they ruined our childhood, adolescence and us by thinking about only themselves. This movie is a elixir for the children who watched the dark side of life by growing in a semi-broken or broken family. I am pretty sure as this movie took a decade, it's sweet and sour composition will amplify into the following decades. Thank you Linklater for this epic creation"
BOYHOOD,27 January 2015,2/10,"I don't get it. I really don't. I thought this was going to be the movie of the year, what with all of the awards already presented to it. I thought, this should be amazing!! Twelve years!! The actor's committed to this project for TWELVE YEARS!! Do you know what's happened to me in the last twelve years??? Let's see....so much that I cannot even begin to list all of it. Some of it joyful, some terrifying, some heartbreaking. Do you know what happens to the family in Boyhood for twelve years??? NOTHING!!!! NOTHING HAPPENS!!!! It seems like most of the good stuff happens between the years. The only reasonably compelling part was dealing with Patricia Arquettes broken relationships. But even a lot of THAT happened between scenes. WHY??? Isn't that the part that might make this worth watching???? Patricia Arquette is the only person that even gives a decent performance. And I LOVE Ethan Hawke!! But he doesn't have anything to do in this movie!! And the kids???? AWKWARD and WEIRD performances. Good as children, goofy as adolescents and just plain BAD as young adults. What the heck??? Why do people think this is good??? This was three hours of WAITING for something to happen. I've had better times in the waiting room of my doctor's office...and I HATE the waiting room at my doctor's office. Ugh."
BOYHOOD,10 April 2015,9/10,"The main complaint about ""Boyhood"" is that the movie is boring and there is no actual story or something interesting. I think that some people don't get the idea of the movie in the first place, actually the movie is about the life of Mason, from early childhood to his arrival at college, and Mason is a normal boy, very normal, he is not a hero, a genius, a CIA agent, a sociopath or a vampire !Can you tell me how many ""interesting"" moments and adventures you've had from the moment of your birth till the moment you joined college? Probably, three to five adventures at most, because you are just normal and so is Mason.In my opinion, ""Boyhood"" represents the lives of many children and teenagers all around the world. It is a very thought provoking movie. Also, Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke played their roles very well.Finally, think it over, maybe you'll find that Mason's boyhood is much more interesting than yours !"
BOYHOOD,10 April 2020,8/10,We always watch actors growing up in a movie but with different actors this time it's the same actors.
BOYHOOD,20 February 2015,2/10,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. There's hardly anything to it, no plot to speak of, and it dramatizes a dullish childhood in a plodding and disconnected way. I enjoyed Ethan Hawke's performance for what that is worth. Our viewing devolved into a drinking game, so whenever a scene opened with our boy in a new house or with a new step father-- cheers! It ended up being just a gimmick, using the same boy for 12 years as he ages. The fact that Mason looked quite different as a child vs as an 18 year old nullified a lot of the mystique of using the same person throughout the 12 years. One would think that the writer/director could have come up with some kind of plot and some more engaging lines for the actors in that amount of time."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2015,1/10,"Boyhood is simply put the biggest waste of 3 hours of my life. The film is about the childhood of a boy from a young age to college, and that is all that happens. The film could of been made by anyone, the script is average, the direction is average and the acting is overall poor except for Ethan Hawke who is the only reason I didn't turn this film off before the end, which I contemplated many times, and his scenes are the only that can be considered good. His acting and the score is all that stops me from giving this film a 1 and it has to be said that the score is fantastic, however this does not save the film from being the most boring film I have ever seen. I love all genres of film from dramas to action and everything in between and have watched many films which would be considered slow but have never seen a film that has literally had nothing happen throughout it whole tiring 3 hours and cannot believe the praise this film is receiving. When the godfather turns 50 it will be remembered as one of the greatest films of all times but when this film turns 50 it will be forgotten and certainly not considered one of the greatest films of all times like some are saying."
BOYHOOD,9 May 2018,8/10,"I don't remember why I added this movie to my IMDB Watchlist, partially 'cuz it was added almost a year ago, but was glad having watched it. I am a foreigner, an Asian to be precise, so almost all the transitions the trio family goes through was eventful and so different from how our day-to-day life here is. Asians, a majority of them, are inclining themself towards the western lifestyle and somehow I ended up hating this modern trend the Eastern world was trying to emulate. I always respected my culture and its style of dealing with family issues. With this biased opinion of mine, I now would like to share what was really special about this movie.The number of divorces Mason's mother goes through, the biological father's consistent efforts to make his children get the best out of their life and the troubles Mason and Samantha go through everytime they shift and many other such mundane happenings of a typical Westerner were very interesting and made me realise that Western lifestyle is weird but natural in its own way.I always keep certain movies close to my heart, especially the ones that have the power to induce a new line of thought, and Boyhood has certainly won a place in there.Oh...yeah, I remembered why I added this to my watch list, the movie was shot over a period of WHOPPING 12 YEARS!!!!! YUP, it was filmed just as Ellar Coltrane grew. Ethan Hawke's performance was deep and it is saddening he was only nominated for an Academy award for best actor in supporting role.Go ahead and give it a try, I am sure it will test your patience!! :)"
BOYHOOD,18 November 2014,10/10,"Ellar Coltrane stars as a young boy growing up eventually into manhood in this piece which was filmed over twelve years by director Richard Linklater.Mason (Coltrane) starts of as a young boy with his parents split up trying to find his way. As Mason grows up his single mother (patrique arquette) starts to have relationships, that also start to effect mason and his sister (Lorelei Linklater). We see mason growing older and more mature, as well as all the characters around him.When I first read the synopsis of this film I thought to myself, that sounds very boring! I now pile heaps of shame on myself for that! This film is a collaborative masterpiece by Linklater, who gives this film a powerful life like feel to it, which no other director would have mastered I think. It was such a spectacle for me to see time literally moving in front of my eyes at just the right pace. Mason is clearly the main character in this film but it is fascinating to see the characters around mature with him, not only the characters but the general world, at the start of the film you are greeted with the old red mac computers to then the iPhone at the end of the film. All of the characters give fantastic performances, at what seems like such ease. We all love a bit of heavy drama in films but boyhood seems to just breeze through the story, not going for clichés that would usually happen in a film about growing up, it says this is what life is and it goes on.I cannot rave enough about this film, it is a beautiful tale of age and one that wipes the floor for me. What a film, a true great!"
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,5/10,"While this was a great concept the reality was less so. If you had been able to really get to know the characters in depth you might enjoy it more but with the leaps in time you get a very short almost two-dimensional view of them. Nothing really exciting or even interesting happens overall. It is just a long....very long... three hours of watching a boy physically grow up and the people around him come, go, and physically change. Mason almost becomes a prop passing through his world and the lives around him yet never really touching it or them. He and the other main characters seem disjointed and almost foreign at times which I can only imagine they felt since it was shot over just 45 days, or roughly 1%, of the odd 10.5 year period that it was filmed. One review I saw compared it to reading a biography but a better explanation would be watching a slide show of 10 years worth of pictures with quick verbal explanations of each slide. Not quite uninteresting but not exactly fascinating or even really insightful of the individuals in the pictures."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,7/10,"The main criticism I've heard of this film is that it's boring and nothing happens. I'm not going to disagree with that. It did drag on a little too long for me, and not much happened. There wasn't a real plot, but that was the point for me. Not everyone has something spectacular and interesting happen to them in their lifetimes. This film reflected that. It showed two kids growing up. The trials they went through, the discoveries they made. Nothing had to happen for it to hit home. It was an honest depiction of life as a kid and a teenager. So many movies try to depict relatable teenagers, but they fall flat because the events that make the movies ""interesting"" are not relatable. This movie managed to remain engrossing for the majority of the run length by simply doing a character study of a kid growing up in the real world. And, getting to see that kid grow up year by year was an incredible thing and director Richard Linklater deserves huge credit for undertaking such a feat. It also didn't hurt the movie that Patricia Arquette delivers a truly wonderful performance. This honest depiction of life was a perfect use of such an unique filmmaking experiment."
BOYHOOD,30 January 2015,8/10,"Boyhood: Some filmmakers ponder whether their work will stand the test of time. This effort from Richard Linklater already has. For a writer-director known for telling stories that take place within twenty-four hours, this shot-over-twelve-years project is remarkable. I had to remind myself that the subtle clues of time's passage were not conventional cinematic illusion, but were in fact real. Fashion, technology, and scenery change around a cast of actors who bravely age before our eyes. The transitions are unjarring yet the effect is riveting.Linklater finds a beautiful truth in the ordinary, even the mundane: from dropping the kids off at school to paying bills at the kitchen table to cheese trays at a graduation party, everything about Mason's family is normal. Yet in watching his world expand and his impression of it mature as the boy ages from youth to adulthood, the everyday is somehow amplified. The effect is profoundly moving, at once both devastating and hopeful. It strikes me that this film reminds us of our humanity in a moment when we desperately need it. That simply taking in breath and connecting with people are infinitely more interesting than all the monsters, robots, car chases, and explosions that Hollywood has to offer.Boyhood is unlike any other film I've ever encountered. It is expressly unspectacular. That is the point. Yet it is a courageous act of faith. Just like having children. Or waking up. Or saying hello. Or sharing with someone the passage of time."
BOYHOOD,1 February 2015,6/10,"A film like this can be a very good film and sometimes it can be a disappointing film. In ""Boyhood""'s case it's a very mixed situation.Meet five year old Mason, in the course of three hours we see him grow up with a very interesting cast of characters; including the fantastic Patricia Arquette, who portrays Mason's young and troubled mother, his absent but lovable dad Ethan Hawke, and his moody, annoying yet equally lovable sister Samantha played by Lorelei Linklater. The film benefits from its very real look on a young boy's growth throughout life. However, the realism is lost very quickly due to some very dry, and expressionless acting and delivery on certain lines from some of the supporting and main characters. I had high hopes going into ""Boyhood"". The beginning is so simple and charming that it makes me look forward to the next three hours of what could be a fantastic and exciting life. I'm sorry to say what I was given after the first hour was a very slow look at some of the more uneventful and less exciting moments in his life.This does not make ""Boyhood"" a bad film however. Another important benefit of ""Boyhood"" is its story telling and story progression. The film is able to seamlessly move from one year of Mason's life to the next. I caught myself saying, amazed at the flawless editing 'Another year down'. Unfortunately the sheer length of ""Boyhood"" is so painfully, yet unavoidably long that you will say ""FINALLY! He's older!"" P.S. Do NOT do keep track of the number of years left in the film. You will become impatient and bored VERY quickly.My overall rating for ""Boyhood"" comes down to my enjoyment of the film over the content.2.5/5 - Enjoyment 4/5 - Movie ContentThe best parts of ""Boyhood"" are it's perfect transitions from year to year, and some of the major supporting character's fantastic performances. The negatives are the unavoidably long length of ""Boyhood"", the expressionless delivery of many lines and actions, and very slow scenes."
BOYHOOD,29 April 2018,1/10,"There were many times I laughed out loud in a theatre full of people opening weekend. Especially at the hilariously overacted abusive stepfather throwing things at the main character, and yelling:""I DON'T EVEN LIKE SQUASH!""I was the only one laughing."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,1/10,"My initial instinct was to rate this movie a 1 out of 10, but that was just because I was so utterly disappointed in how bad this movie is compared to how big it has been built up by the industry (aka the hype). Everyone raved about it. There is NO reason they should have. It contains terrible actors - Ethan Hawke was great in this. The rest of the nobody's were emotionless extras who most likely have appeared in ONE movie in their life, Boyhood. It features terrible dialog - ""Don't forget to floss"" he was told by a passing by photography judge as they chatted after a photography competition.... It has a lifetime of bad decisions by the main actress (I only refer in general terms to Patricia Arquette as an actress - I don't mean to imply in the least that she can act more than stand and talk and cry and fall and cry - this movie needed a stronger actress, an actual actress maybe) It contains no actual story, no point, no message, no complete thought.... I found myself wanting to watch it simply to make fun of how bad it is. Other than that, you really shouldn't waste your time. It should have been called Boringhood."
BOYHOOD,15 December 2014,9/10,"So I finally got a chance to watch this movie, been waiting to see it for a long time. I have to say that the idea of filming a movie for 12 years is fascinating, seeing how the actors grown up before our eyes it really makes this movie special. The story is good, I mean its about family and growing up, we have seen it already, but it's made different and it really look like something you never saw. Ethan and Patricia are great here, scenes with Ethan and kids are one of my favorite in the movie, while Patricia got the drama going and was pretty good. Only thing I didn't like is the main character, he was empty. The first part of the film was good, but as he grown, you could see on actor that somehow he doesn't want to act anymore, like he just need to be over with this as soon as possible, and I get that. He was just a kid when this all started, maybe he changed his mind. But overall this was a good movie, it will surely be remembered for a long time."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2015,1/10,"Rented this movie over the weekend after Oscar nominations and reading reviews, etc. I think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that Linklater made a project of filming his daughter/actress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic. I can't understand how an actual documentary like Hoop Dreams gets snubbed, not too mention Selma's director getting snubbed, but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy. The novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds, you watch them 'physically grow' that's it, that's the big wow factor of the film. I'd of preferred to watch grass grow actually! The acting and scenes seem forced and I couldn't figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? A documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining. Mason, the son's character, never really evolves, the cliché single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men, has been done before- keep in mind this is NOT a documentary, this is a movie/story- I couldn't help but think to myself while watching this film that I know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous. I mean, Mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh. Mason's first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? A commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? Clearly I'm in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film. I don't see the originality, excellence in acting, directing, etc. outside of using the same actors for 12 years- one of which, is the directors daughter."
BOYHOOD,17 March 2015,4/10,"Look, I think I get what the director is trying to say: ""Life is a series of moments: some happy, some sad, some important, some not but all of it adding up to a whole."" But I don't think you need 2 hours and 45 minutes to say that.I watched the movie as a rental and sat through the whole thing. My wife walked out of the room after an hour. After 90 minutes I started to look at the time. And I still had another hour plus to go.The kids grow from happy, bickering grade schoolers to moody and sullen college kids. Their father is introduced as a slacker, showing up to entertain the kids every so often. He ""grows up"" to become a family man with his new wife and children. The mother works, gets a college degree, and becomes a professor herself. And marries two guys who start out charming but who become alcoholic and abusive. At the end of the movie she cries, wondering if this is all life is comprised of. So this may be how some lives work out but it doesn't make it entertaining to watch.Seeing the actors age over the long process of making the movie was the most interesting thing about the film. It did feel that I was watching lives unfold. They were just lives that I ended up not caring about."
BOYHOOD,5 July 2015,2/10,"This movie reads as if you're just watching someone's memories or old family videos. There really is not anything to spoil, I just checked the box for safe measure. There are only a few positives which made me even give this a 2.The father (Ethan Hawke) was portrayed so well. He was completely believable. The time passing was seamless. You could not tell when the years had passed. I guess that was what they were going for and they nailed it. The mom (Patricia Arquette) is easily the best thing that happened to this movie.The problems. Oh, the problems. Remember how I said the mom is the best thing about this movie? Well, too bad because she isn't the main character. She is left severely underdeveloped and the decisions she makes never make sense to you, the viewer, because you never REALLY get to know her. It's sad.Even sadder, you're left to follow the boy who grows up to be someone you can't even feel good about. He is lazy. He gets older, but never really grows up. You're left watching him thinking ""eh."" He just is not likable. The sister gets older. That's it. She does nothing at all for the story. She might as well not have been there. The director must've just wanted to give his daughter a job. She doesn't even look like she could possibly be the offspring of the mom and dad.Finally, the movie just stops unexpectedly and abruptly. There is NO payoff. Like I said, NOTHING HAPPENS. You're left absolutely upset that you just spent damn near 3 hours on nothingness. All this movie has going for it is the 12 years thing and it is nowhere near sufficient. If they would've done the same movie using multiple actors to play each age, there would have been no buzz; because, there is no story. NOTHING HAPPENS."
BOYHOOD,29 August 2015,,"This movie is about the growth path of a boy from childhood to adulthood. He has been living separately with father and mother, step father, etc. It documents the details of his life, his childhood dreams, sexual fantasies, relationships, confusions at his teenage year, his perceptions about his family, about friendship, and about his life. I would like to say the most impressive characters in this movie is not Mason himself, but rather his mother and his father. His mother has been struggling from a single mother to finding a decent job, but at the end of the movie she is about to cry when she looked back at her life path: it is like she has fulfilled a couple of milestones in life and the next stop of life is burial.Mason's father, on the other hand, is always the 'cool' guy. He has been a band member when he was young, he was always bringing fun to Mason and his sister. He cares about his son and daughter, and when he knows about his son's confusions, he is supportive and demonstrates his understanding through his personal teenager experiences, he thinks life is a play, and it's important to feel the life.Mason himself is always a thinker,he captures the details in his life and have some thought-provoking points. He looked into his mother's life and found out the confusions she always has through all experiences;He appreciates the loners and respect their opinions; he has his own confusions about living about his own life and caring about other people's judgments;he has his own points about personal communications and experiences; and he is always thinking about the point of life and everything.In all it's a thought-provoking movie. Seize the moment, seize right now, life will be fulfilled."
BOYHOOD,28 May 2016,1/10,"Listen, I'm a film buff, and I've seen some movies that I think are utterly flawless while others would think them dull. Films like There Will Be Blood, 2001, Drive, and No Country For Old Men are some of my favorite films of ALL time. I love movies that are bleak and/or slow burn when they go somewhere or use silence to build tension. So when I say a film is boring, I like to think you can trust me. Nothing happened in this movie. It will not change anyone's life, it will teach you nothing. If you're set on seeing it then all I can say is be prepared for 3 hours of plot-less nothingness, cheesy life lessons, and pretentious inane dialogue that will make you want to inflict physical violence on someone. I do have to give Linklater some credit for the film's experimental style, but that praise only goes so far. Honestly I'd give this one a 6 or very generous 7 out of ten as it is not a terrible movie, but I'm giving it a one here because this movie is almost as overrated as The Dark Knight."
BOYHOOD,22 July 2016,10/10,"*Note* There might not be any spoilers, I marked it just in case.Boyhood stars Ellar Coltrane as a 6 year old, who lives a life with his sister named Samantha. They live with their mom, played by academy award winner Patricia Arquette, who is divorced with their father, played by Ethan Hawke. They all move after every terrible boyfriend and/or husband Olivia encounters. Sometimes it is an argument that eventually becomes physical and sometimes it is an abusive husband that yells, punches, ETC. This film shows each actor/actress grow and/or mature throughout 12 years. Think of seeing the Harry Potter actors/actresses grow up through the decade. The two things I really liked about the film is the acting, which everybody did very well. The other thing is, after every year Ellar Coltrane's character ages, there is a new story arche so-to-speak. Like one year is being with an abusive husband and them leaving and getting over it. Then the next year it is something else. They did a great job with it, and with a great editing team, it flows extremely well.Boyhood is easily the best movie I have ever seen. It was snubbed for best picture and will go down as one of the greats like Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, Godfather, Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Dark Knight trilogy just to name a few."
BOYHOOD,18 June 2015,10/10,"I can see no reason not to give this movie a glowing 10/10. I was captivated from beginning to end.The performances, first and foremost, are superb. Ellar Coltraine is wonderful throughout, what a likable kid/youth he is in the film - and doubtless is in real life - but my personal favourite is Lorelei Linklater. If I had a sister, I'd like her to be just like that. She is 'well cool', big time.If you are allergic to 'cinéma very tay' - this site won't allow the real spelling, shame on IMDb!!! - (in the loosest sense of the term) then maybe you won't be so enamoured of the film as I am, but quite frankly, I was caught up in the first minute and swept along by the development of the characters and the plot (OK, such as it is - but those who post ""nothing happens"" miss the point rather).I have worked with children and teenagers for most of my adult life - especially kids with 'problems at home' and I found the young characters in the movie, well, admirable. The 'goodness' of the characters was heart-warming and I found their emotions and frustrations so real-to-life and so positive that I found I had a tear in my eye at more than one point. What great people these characters are, they give me faith in the human race, mirror as they do such wonderful, if troubled, kids I have been privileged to work with over the past 30 years plus.Thanks to everyone involved in making this film, a 'keeper' if ever there was one."
BOYHOOD,7 January 2015,6/10,"When I first heard of this movie a few months back, all the buzz was about how Richard Linklater had made a film over a twelve-year period with the same core cast. Like most people, I found that to be incredibly impressive and was eager to see the film. I finally got around to watching it last night and can't say anything other than I was incredibly disappointed. This movie not only failed to deliver on a lot of fronts, but the combination of the unique filming process as well as the general theme of the movie could have produced such a better movie.Before I dissect, a quick synopsis of the plot. The film follows a 5 year-old boy, Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane), and his somewhat dysfunctional family up until he leaves for college at 18. His father (played by Hawke) appears sparingly in the lives of Mason and his older sister, Samantha (played by Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei). His mother (played quite impressively by Arquette) marries twice, both times to alcoholics who clash with Mason. However, she also gets her life somewhat together throughout the film. As the movie starts, she is moving back to Houston to go to college while her mother helps her with the kids. Eventually, she becomes a college professor herself. This was a very strong performance by Arquette and easily the best of the movie. The film basically follows Mason and, to a lesser degree, his family, through this crucial period of life where the man he will eventually become will be influenced and shaped by the people and events around him. Among other things, we see him fall in love, get his heartbroken, get a job, go through school, drink, smoke weed, move, switch schools, and become a talented artist. Here is the problem with this movie - despite seeing all of this, and filming the characters over a dozen years of their lives, with the exception (maybe) of Olivia (Mason's mother) you don't feel any real connection to them. Mason has a very bland personality and nothing really of interest to offer the world, or the viewer. Samantha isn't really any better. There is a scene in the film in which Mason comes home past curfew and is confronted by Olivia's second husband, Jim. I felt like Jim was speaking for the audience when he points out how Mason just mumbles his way through life, never really says anything and then yells at Mason to ""speak up!"" There were a few times little things in this movie reminded me of things from my own childhood, something I think most viewers will relate to. However, this made me reflect a little more on my own childhood (or 'boyhood,' if you will) and only made me more disappointed at how much better this film could have been. You see, when I reflect on my childhood now, in my mid-30's, I realize almost every moment of it could have been defined one of three ways - significant, insignificant, but most of all, seemingly insignificant at the time but holding much more significance as I got older. I feel for a movie to do true justice to the period of childhood which will largely define us as adults should have focused far more on the things that were significant in the child's life as well as the things that seemed insignificant but carried much more significance as time went on. This is the period of our life where we develop many of the values, beliefs, skills, goals, personalities, interests, flaws, and even baggage that we will carry through the rest of our life. This movie did a very poor job of displaying the significance of those moments in Mason's life, as well as really developing most of the characters into any type of person who the audience could really empathize with. I give the movie six out of ten, because I really do think the concept of filming over 12 years is exceptional, and should not be discounted because the end result was so lackluster."
BOYHOOD,4 August 2018,5/10,"In the beginning , i thought that Im gonna see a happy ending , or purpose of his life, or what he wanna be. But, i just saw he is smiling. Not mean anything. I thought they filmed about his succes or something in the end of movie"
BOYHOOD,25 August 2019,9/10,"I felt as if I was re experiencing my childhood watching this film. Divorce, Lost in video games as means to escape, before the internet, being outside, getting in trouble, not fitting in, even the haircut scene really hit home for me. I really enjoyed it and wells of emotion kept me engaged for the movies entirety. I wasnt sold on the acting on Patricias parts at times and over all kept me from giving the film a 10. A must watch for anyone looking for a emotional, sentimental, life story. Has me reevaluating my own life which I must say only good movies would do."
BOYHOOD,22 August 2014,1/10,"This is easily the most over-rated movie I have ever seen in my life. I went to it with very high expectations given all the amazing reviews. I found the movie to be extremely trite, cliché, over-wrought, boring, pretentious and too long. The movie basically rests on the gimmick of filming the same actors for 12 years. Take that away, and the movie is nothing but one cliché scene after another. So if you're in to seeing people kinda slowly age/grow up, then this movie will blow you away, because that's basically all that it offers. If you are looking for a good engaging story, I'm afraid this does not have it."
BOYHOOD,2 June 2014,6/10,"There are three things about this film, which I saw yesterday at the Seattle International Film Festival, that I didn't enjoy. First, Mason is boring. He plays an apathetic teenager. When Mason is with other people his age, like his high school girlfriend, the scenes are drawn out and tiresome. I found myself checking my watch for the time. Mason's apathy becomes interesting only when we see the reactions from the adults in his life - his father stops the car on the way to a baseball game and asks his young children to share more details about their lives; later, Mason's high school photography teacher preaches to him about work ethic. These conversations are thrilling to behold as audience. Secondly, the film is over-sexualized, a Hollywood exaggeration of real life. The mom's psychology teacher uses sexual attraction as an example when explaining Pavlov's famous dog experiment. At the end of the film, a colleague of Mason's mother, a woman more than twice his age, makes a sly comment about offering to ""drop Mason off at college."" The female dishwasher at Mason's first job at a restaurant tells him that ""she won't kiss him, but she'll blow him."" Do moments like this happen in real life? Sure. Do they happen with the frequency that Linklater suggest? No. As a result, the film's verisimilitude suffers. Finally, the film's main characters don't give us a convincing display of nostalgia. In real life, time moves linearly but our memories are always reaching back. After a minor individual reappears in the film to thank Patricia Arquette for something she said that changed his life, she gives a blank stare. We don't see her mind buzzing, as we might see from a person who was racking her memory for who this stranger was and what she might have said. Furthermore, the camera cuts away from Patricia Arquette and presents the conversation to us at a mid-range distance. This is one of multiple instances where the film misses an opportunity to show characters reaching back into themselves for memories of scenes we saw earlier.Despite these flaws, there were some truly brilliant things. Time passes very quickly in the film. This mirrors how many of us feel in our lives. The two hours and forty three minutes running time feels more like fifteen short films, each poignant and beautiful. People who are so important in our lives at one point in time - our teachers, our siblings, our parents, our roommates - are gone the next moment. This is beautifully done after Mason and his sister grow quite close to the children of his mother's new husband, only to never see them again after their mother leaves him.The aging of Mason is obvious, the aging of his parents - played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke - is far more subtle and in my mind and far more powerful. It's not just their ability to act a new role. Patricia Arquette begins as an exasperated, high-energy young mother and ends as an almost zen-like woman full of wisdom with a steady job. Ethan Hawke brings tremendous energy to the film when we first see him, he's just returned from a year and a half in Alaska. By the end of the film, he's a suit and tie professional at an insurance company. The real actors grow older, mirroring the aging of their characters. We can tangibly see the energy drain out of Ethan Hawke's face with each passing year. This is unlike anything you've ever seen. It's subtle, but extremely powerful.Overall, Boyhood is a massively ambitious project, and an enjoyable film, but nowhere near the top films I've ever seen. Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"", a similar coming of age story also set in Texas, was a work of art that appealed on many levels. Boyhood is not a spiritual journey. It's a genuine story, but it only moves in one direction. I think the film could have been more powerful had Linklater asked the characters to convey nostalgia for the younger versions of themselves. Such direction would have added a dimension to the film."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,2/10,"OK, this is one unique movie - making it trough 12 real years with same team - and that is why people will say how great it is. But, really, it is not! It has nothing but that ""12 years making"" fact. Almost three hours about a super-boring ""retardish"" boy growing ...sooo boring. I can watch almost everything and I did... but this is too much. Imagine everyone of us, making a movie in episodes trough 12 years. Just cutting clips and putting them in one 3-hours movie. Separate parents, a bit of drinking problems, first school loves,... and all so shallow... just showing more-less normal kidos life! Any award(s) this movie will get is only because 12-years-making of it. But it is so boring that it doesn't deserve any!!! Big disappointment! Really, watching a tide for three hours is more exciting than this movie. I gave 2 stars - one for original idea of making it and one for my favorites, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette."
BOYHOOD,6 July 2021,10/10,My mind was blown after knowing the fact that the movie was shot for 12 years. It's a piece of art you wouldn't wanna miss it.
BOYHOOD,8 June 2021,10/10,"Representation of an average American family, realism, no plot twists and a lot of shooting time. All that is ""boyhood"", the masterpiece of director Richard Linklater (""before dawn"") and although released in 2014 does not lose the magic, with a classic Ethan Hawke in the director's films, but now playing a divorced father and Carefree that from time to time he has to see his children, the greatest Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) and Mason (Ellar Coltrane), the latter will focus the film and the progress both in his life and in his family.The two of them live with their mother, played by Patricia Arquette, who earned her a well-deserved Oscar, because her performance was famous, demonstrating that pain and weight that a mother who puts on her shoulder a family, who, like every family, goes to have their problems, whether they be different foster parents or conflicts with Samantha's temperaments or Mason's disinterest.Not a minor fact is that the film was shot for 12 years, they took a meeting per year where the corresponding scenes were recorded, this in order to show the growth of the actors in parallel with the characters and they achieve it perfectly, at times It seems that you see a documentary because of the realism it generates, and that is cinema at its best, without wanting to steal false tears or lying feelings, it only wants to show you a reality, a family and a person who seeks what to do with the life that I touch him."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,6/10,"I guess this is a spoiler review, in that this is a movie about ""nothing""... but, is that such a novel concept? Seinfeld made a hugely successful TV show out of nothing... Ah, but is it easier to pallet everyday, relatable ""nothing-ness"" when presented with a comedic edge, than it is to view is in an ""artsy"" (debatable) format which focuses on the harsh realities and struggles of everyday life that many go to the movies to escape from? That's where I sit after viewing this film ... not sure if what I just saw is great art that will stand the test of time, or did I just lose 3 hours of squirming discomfort viewing a painful, dysfunctional family's struggles that I shared more than a few relatable moments with? (And not in a good way.)I went into this film with high expectations - which was mistake #1. Now that said, I think it would've been a mistake to have never seen this movie ... the concept itself - being filmed over the course of 12 years with same actors - is novel and ambitious enough to warrant viewing it. I'd just advise viewers read *many* reviews before going ... the negative as well as the positive. Both have their merits. Be aware of what you're setting yourself up for. Had I done that, I'd have adjusted my expectations accordingly and *might* have walked away with a different first impression of this film.A little background here ... I'm not someone who needs my art spoon-fed to me ... I've been a film festival aficionado for over 25 years. That said, I also know that not every film festival offering is great by any means -- you have to weed through to find the gems.I also *get* that great art isn't always ""comfortable"". Sometimes (for me) the mark of a great film is that it gets you thinking -- for good, or bad, and you don't always feel like what you just saw was something *amazing* the minute you walk out of the theater. It's for that reason I gave this movie a 6 instead of a 4 or a 5.For me, even if the film is uncomfortable, if it sparks a dialogue and debate about what you just saw for days/weeks after, then I will rank a film higher (I'm thinking ""Magnolia"", here, where I walked out of thinking ""what the heck did I just see??"" to eventually settling on it being a pretty cool concept piece work that I'd wished I'd known a little more about going in.) So, I guess in that sense, this film is not without its merits. I imagine it will probably receive its fair share of awards and accolades. Maybe some films just need multiple viewings to truly appreciate them? Maybe this one of them. But just like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Schindler's List"", I'm glad I saw them, but can't see myself sitting through this movie a second time. While without any graphic violence, Boyhood has painful everyday moments in the struggles of single-motherhood that hit to core, which I don't think I'd care to relive.Bottom line: go in with your eyes wide open as to what you're about to see. Watch it for the value of the novelty of the concept, and don't look for any ground-break plot development, as you won't find any. And, if you're a single mother, even if you and your partner as artsy film festival types, I'd highly advise avoiding this as a date nite selection."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,1/10,"Watched ""Boyhood"" - what crap....so many little liberal digs (ovomit sign planting, McCain sign stealing) ovomit opponent scaring off the ovomit sign offer of the main character with advice that he can shoot trespassers....etc, etc, etc, ad infinitum.... stopped watching: too much propaganda.Every nuance re: politics is so far left it disappears stage left. The woman sooo excited about ovomit is especially bad....a female Chris Matthews...chills running up her leg....wretched.Quit in the middle...glad I did..... went to IMDb this morning and really enjoyed all the ""1"" ratings and comments.....MUCH more entertaining than the movie...one I really like had a one word synopsis - ""BAD"" - do read all the ""1 star"" reviews....ignore ALL the others:"
BOYHOOD,14 March 2015,4/10,"This film has been terribly oversold. I haven't been this disappointed in a film in a very long time. It just went on and on looking for a place to end - I couldn't wait for it to be over. The writing is predictable, cinematography fair, and the acting non-existent. It's all gimmick - that it took twelve years to film. Toward the end, when 'Mom' says, ""I thought there would be more,"" all I could do was breathe a soft ""Amen."" I can't get over that Patricia Arquette won the Oscar... She was terrible! I suppose overacting is something these days. It's Marissa Tomei all over again. Having seen this movie, I believe more than ever that Laura Dern deserved the award much more! It's just criminal that Boyhood received the number of Oscar nominations it did. I'll never get those two-and-a-half hours back. If you can avoid seeing this film, do."
BOYHOOD,5 October 2014,5/10,"Just to clarify, I think this is an okay movie; my critiques are different from what I've seen other reviewers write. For example, I'm not troubled with the minimalist plot or running time or the acting/development of Mason, the main character. I liked the minimalist plot, the running time didn't particularly bother me, and I think the critiques of Mason that I've heard sound suspiciously like critiques of the millennial generation as a whole. Was the filmed- over-12-years thing borderline gimmicky? Perhaps, but I thought it was an intriguing concept.What bothered me about this movie was that it claimed to represent the average, US American family. How interesting that the director's idea of this happened to be a straight, white, middle-class family where the boy struggles with his identity. The movie could have been just as interesting if they focused on Samantha (Mason's sister). Instead, we have yet another coming of age story that is male-centered. This isn't to say that this is a bad movie because of that, just that it's not as new or revolutionary if you look at the basic plot.The other main critique I have is that the movie's emotional climax--it's the moments that seize you, not the other way around--was not a new or mind-blowing realization for me. Maybe it's because I think often about my own mortality and how to make my life mean something, but I had already come to this revelation on my own. When it appears as the big emotional moment in the film, I was therefore not moved and I came away from the viewing feeling like I hadn't really connected to the characters or to the changes they undergo.I don't think the movie is awful, like some people are saying--I think it deserves at least 5/10. There are some good moments, and the acting is good (Patricia Arquette in particular). However, I don't think it's the movie of the decade, like it's being hailed as."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,1/10,"I bought into it. Heard all the noise surrounding the film and how remarkable it was to have filmed it over 12 years. To be honest, I found even that, not too remarkable. If you want to watch a story of some folks that absolutely have nothing to offer and no meaningful contribution to make, then go ahead and watch this film. It was ridiculously long and tedious. I should have quit watching after the first 30 minutes but I suppose I was holding on for dear life to see if anything at all might happen to make this movie worth while. It turned out to be an absolute snore and there isn't a thing at all memorable about it other than it being a huge waste of my time.I will NEVER be able to comprehend how this movie has such a high rating nor the fact that it was up for so many awards. You guys need to get over the artsy-fartsy concept and take a look at the story - it is absolute crap."
BOYHOOD,15 October 2019,3/10,"Too boring, I even didn't finish it and whatch to the end"
BOYHOOD,23 February 2016,10/10,"Cinema, as the seventh art in the words of Italian film theoretician Ricciotta Canudo, can be, in itself, so naturally complex, full of mystery and meaning. It is in simplicity, however, that art may find its best and final form, and this may be director and writer Richard Linklater and « Boyhood »'s strongest suit.Filmed and produced over the course of twelve intermittent years, « Boyhood » centers on the story of Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane), a regular boy, as he grows up and lives alongside his divorced parents (played by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) and sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater). The variety of specific and episodic events the movie delivers during the course of its 165 minutes make it clear that the circle of life continues to spin, moments and people change, and no matter - and perhaps specifically because of - what we go through, it seems we are all going to be okay. It is a message of growth and hope, an assurance that it is all part of life.Delivering what can be considered an imitation of life itself, most of the events depicted in the film are mundane, even ordinary. Mason and Samantha have sibling fights, have to adapt to new cities and school environments, learn to live with new family members, play video games, go to parties. Linklater delivers a movie about the beauty of the ordinary, no events shown are extraordinary in themselves - that characteristic can be saved for the movie as a whole. Even the camera work showed by Linklater - in the absence of extremely warm colors - is simple, natural.Time transitions in the movie are seamlessly performed, and the soundtrack helps situate the viewer and create an environment for the scenes. With songs that include the works of Paul McCartney and Lady Gaga, Arcade Fire and Wilco, Blink 182 and Pharrell Williams, the movie manages to be, at the same time, already inserted in the current pop and internet culture, as well as a nostalgic piece, all the while relieving successes of the past decade (as the Harry Potter movie premiere scene, for example).Easiness is a key concept in « Boyhood ». There is comedy, drama, angst and another plethora of feelings, and yet nothing is overplayed, no moments are overdone. Linklater, through his story and characters, gives us perspective, focuses on the big picture and still delivers delicate beauty in simple scenes as the one of the proud mother who watches a child's graduation ceremony, or a family that gathers and sings.« Boyhood » can be considered more than a movie, it is an experience. It invites the viewer to immerse him/herself in there, and recognize moments of his/her's own life on the screen. It appeals to the humanity of us all, and connects us through similar life experiences. It runs for nearly three hours long, but had in run for six, it still would not be a problem."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect from this story about growing up, life and humanity in general shot over the period of 12 years with the same cast and has been garnering rave reviews. With that premise and clocking in at around 2 hours & 45 minutes, I reckoned it would be boring to say the least. It was anything but that. I neither felt the time fly away nor did I wanted this to end. My favorite movie genres pretty much reflect that I watch movies to experience fiction - be a part of something that just won't happen in real life (at least not according to what we know as of now). But this movie proved that our 'ordinary' lives are far more interesting than we give credit for. It is one of those movies every time you watch it after awhile, your perception of it will change and you will probably reflect your own life in it. I was pleasantly surprised about how hard it hit home at some parts. This 'Technical Masterpiece' wouldn't be complete without top notch acting all round and its narrative prowess. It is not just some movie that took twelve years to shoot, it is much more than that. I'm sure it will be a Classic in the future."
BOYHOOD,28 July 2014,,"The timeline for this project is worthy of recognition on its own, in my opinion. A whole team of people working on one project every year for 12 years and compiling scenes into a final project is quite monumental.Unfortunately, despite my best efforts I did not get a chance to ask Linklater questions about this film while he was doing a Q&A screening, but I would have love to have asked him the extent to which the script was pre-written in advance and the extent to which it was written or co-written along the way with the cast, by Linklater himself, or with other crew writers. From what I understand about Linklater's previous ""real time capture"" work in the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight series (which I hope continues, and it looks like Boyhood will continue since this appears to be the first installation), Linklater heavily involves the cast actors in the writing process. I am not an actor, but I hear a lot about actors having the ability to ""improvise"" in character on the spot. Linklater is instead asking actors to reflect on their own lives and their character's development to revisit it once every year, every eight or nine years, etc.Linklater takes what I had only ever seen before in documentaries like the ""7 Up"" series and gives us a condensed picture of the major memorable moments for a boy along his life growing up. Storyteller and monologist Joe Frank has a talk on what he calls ""Lynchpin"" moments throughout his life when he would tell himself, ""I am going to remember this"", and goes on to state that these lynchpins get sewn together into his most vivid memories in life. I feel that this film depicts the Lynchpins of growing up. Also, I find it interesting that this is one of the first films that I can point to which really explores the ascent from childhood to adulthood in the 21st century.I am not sure how I felt about the ending of the film and would be curious to hear others' thoughts on it. It seemed to celebrate itself in a sense which I think worked by combining the 12-year completion of the project with the lead character's graduation at the end. I think the ""seize the moment"" line is pretty great at the end, but almost which that the protagonist's response had not been so jumbled...yet, albeit jumbled, his response about floating from moment to moment seemed to fit well with the theme of the entire project."
BOYHOOD,26 January 2015,7/10,"""Boyhood"" is really good. What Ethan Hawke said in an interview is true. It's ""Tolstoyesque"". It's War and Peace with the war shoved into the background, and concerned with the peace of only one family. But though its ambition seems novelistic, it can only happen on cinema screen. It's like a movie directed by Time itself. Even if you discount it's daring feat of following its characters through 12 years in time-lapse fashion, it's still got so much poetry. Poetry of simply going through time. To be sure, there are some banal moments crept in here and there where director wanted to make us feel the historical time via characters discussing contemporary issues or introducing characters that are representational to the times (like 9/11 & Bush discussions, and a character being Iraqi war veteran – It could've been done subtler). What concerns us more in our lives is our immediate personal time, not historical time reported in newspapers. But these moments help you in this 3 hour movie to get up and go pee without having to hit the pause button. And one strange thing for me is that I identified more with the parents than with the kids. I think it's first time for me in a movie. So, that's it I guess, I stopped growing up, and started aging. At 32, it's already very late.The movie is essentially very American. The culture, family dynamics, and all. I wondered how even more moving it would have been had it been made here, with the life and times that I lived in.I particularly loved this moment in the movie, where the son is leaving home to go to college, and the mother is suddenly overwhelmed with great sorrow, seeing what's left of her life. ""I just thought there would be more"", she says."
BOYHOOD,9 November 2014,1/10,"Real life, well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie. Life is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant for anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with their every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed it, but then again why watch it, what is the purpose in making movie about completely regular life of one functional but boring family. At the end of the movie I started to value my time only because I lost three hours spending time with this people while I could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job, as I am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all. I wonder..."
BOYHOOD,10 November 2014,6/10,"I liked the idea that we were following the same actors throughout the entirety of the movie. We follow a character, Mason, through his childhood and teenage journey in life and it was interesting to see the actors actually grow along with the movie. For me it made it more believable and very relatable. However, i did not feel the character's personality grew on me at all. As soon as Mason reaches his teens he becomes very dull and monotonous. The only character who I enjoyed watching was the father and how he could somehow save the audience from Mason's vanilla character.I felt that the movie dealt with a lot of life experiences you go through as a child and in some way you can relate to the character but I felt that the director did this in a very plain and dull fashion using very little symbolism and no creativeness. It felt like a film anyone could make. To be honest, 'Boyhood' felt way too long. I understand that the director must have needed 3 hours to accomplish an experience and take us through a journey but the adventure was like a trip to the dentist. You just wanted it to end. Talking about endings, I somewhat liked the ending however for this movie I think it was a wrong directorial decision and felt unsatisfied. In my opinion the idea of a 12 year moving picture saved the movie and without it, it would have become a very ordinary movie."
BOYHOOD,25 September 2014,10/10,"I just got back from a screening here in Hungary, and I am just not able to get the movie out of my head. Almost 3 hours, but for me, it felt like 3 minutes. So captivating. So real, not gimmicky, not cheesy. Well done, America. What really amazes me is that this movie was able to get my attention for almost 3 hours without any breakthrough and grand action. Maybe it did so, because this movie was about real life. Life as it is. Grandmothers and mothers, fathers and stepfathers, sisters and friends, young love and teenager life. Moving and fighting, cheating and tears. Throughout the movie, I had this diverse feelings inside me, one of them is happiness and gladness, because as the movie showed us: life is beautiful. Life is extraordinary. On the other side, I felt depressed, because as the movie showcased: we are confused, we don't know what and how to do, we don't really know what life is, and we expect so much more of it. But I think the main message of the movie is at the ending. That was perfect. Every moment seizes us.This movie seized me. Astonishing."
BOYHOOD,23 November 2014,9/10,"Boyhood is the closest movie to real life ever filmed. It follows growing up of a young boy and his family through many different life situations, following him throughout his entire childhood, up to the moment of his college education.The special thing about this movie is that it is filmed through period of incredible 12 years, with the whole cast staying the same the entire time, which makes Boyhood quite a revolutionary title.The movie itself is brilliantly directed, and although it hasn't got any real plot, the portrait of characters is amazing. They are developing in accordance to their aging in real life, which makes their performance perfectly adapted to their own age and the role that they are acting.Richard Linklater is well know for his tendencies of making movies that happen through long periods of time, such as Before Midnight (Sunrise, Sunset), but I feel that Boyhood presents the crown of his career, making this a revolutionary and perfectly directed movie, that will be a great template for young directors with similar ideas in the future.Highly recommended for users that enjoy real life dramas, and all others who enjoy a great piece of modern cinematography....."
BOYHOOD,5 August 2014,8/10,"Viewers familiar with director Richard Linklater's work will find it no surprise that he offers us another little gem in his oeuvre...For others it will be a worthwhile discovery of a director who makes movies that appear to be like life itself. Boyhood's strength doesn't come from a wrought scenario, but seems to follow the follow the character's lives quite naturally. It all flows along, although there are quite a few rough patches in Mason's life - he goes through quite a process, just like his other family members...after all, we are offered a front row seat to gaze at his development between 6 and 18. The movie reminded me of authors Karl öve Knausgard or Haruki Marukami: like them, Linklater has a talent of showing us that there is magic in the ordinary. This is a delightful movie..."
BOYHOOD,20 December 2014,1/10,"Oh IMDb, seriously? I trust your ratings, and always check before deciding whether to watch or not. I was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that, but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, The Lord of the Ring series, GoodFellas, Star Wars and likes, its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them. To praise Boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value. Just because you took 12 years filming this doesn't mean you get to get a 99% RT and an 8.4 IMDb without deserving it.Okay, let me see! What was this movie about? Nothing! 12 freaking years of shooting for what? What really happened there? First of all, there was no plot, no story whatsoever. It shows, look a boy was 9 playing with his sister, fighting with his sister, eating macaroni, going to bathroom, he got taller, grew his hair, he cut them back, grew them again, he's eating, going to bathroom again, drinking, kissing a girl, breaking up with a girl, going to college. Oh come on that's what kids do, they grow up right? The film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of Mason, a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever. He's not a hero, not a zero, not a lover, not a loser, not a fighter, not even a dreamer. There's nothing about this character that will pause you and let you think about it. Mr. Linklater couldn't even catch any memorable scene out of it. I appreciate his movie shooting technique but there should be more of it. Since Boyhood supposed to be a story about a boy's life, his inner world, his feelings, his dream, or his struggle growing up, his happiness/sadness but there is no depth at all. For instance, I was once a kid, now I'm grown up. I saw my life then, how my times were; my thoughts, my actions, my dreams etc. It could have been like, Mason as boy how were his thoughts, by the time he was growing up what changes he had to face in his adulthood, how he struggled or how he enjoyed, what was his dream, how he adapted with his struggling family. Instead Mr. Linklater showed some ordinary (does not mean they needs to be extraordinary) folks leading lives where nothing happened at all. This is a not a growing up story, this is certainly not a movie about teenage crisis; in fact this movie is about nothing. So that's the point? Call this 12-years-gimmick a masterpiece?! Oh come on, give me a break."
BOYHOOD,25 February 2015,5/10,"i have seen Richard Linklater's movies before and i have to say i love his work.specially the movies like waking life and before trilogy are amazing. now when it comes to this movie, i see this movie as an attempt to put some kid's ordinary life on the big screen. and i am being honest, THIS BOY's life is ORDINARY. and why this movie got so many good ratings?its because people found it different as it took them 12 years because of the same crappy cast(okay the cast is good but storyline is sh!t) and then there are some lowlife cliché philosophical talks and drunk people. i mean if you want philosophical crap then watch waking life,it is far better. i don't understand the intent of this movie. people don't wanna see something they see everyday,this kid as he grows up like all other American kids,who wants to see that? well directed? yeah kind of..but still stupid. i am being kind by giving this 5. hope Richard Linklater does better in his next movie."
BOYHOOD,28 March 2015,1/10,"The single interesting thing about this movie are these bad reviews here and I do believe that IMDb has a lot of fake accounts...otherwiseI don't understand how this movie got such a big ratting. Who founded this movie ? This should not be o movie It's just a documentary about watching flies f*** I understand that a review has to be 10 lines at least but comm on ! For this movie is way to much! ""a-once-in-a-lifetime-movie"" - Mike Ryan the Huffington post No s*** tinkerbell !! Who pays these people to give these reviews ?"
BOYHOOD,9 July 2014,8/10,"Just watched a prescreening of the film involved with a Q & A with producer John Sloss. Twelve years in the making, this film has quite a few high notes, but experiences quite a few flaws (as no film is perfect). The style reminds me of American Beauty (though Sloss denied it had anything to do with it). It has some dark undertones of suburban life and tumultuous households. Broken families, constant moving, dislocation and relocation are all major themes.The center around the narrative, Mason, (Ellar Coltrane) is unique in that the actor who plays him while young sticks with him as he ages. It is one of few experiences in which we as an audience physically (and emotionally) see a character age. Another unique aspect is the portrayal of divorce. Divorce is a very rare concept seen on screen. Often it is a widow(er) who drives the drama, but the concept of divorce is something only half an audience can relate to. I think it realistically portrays this dark concept by constant remarriage, relocation, poverty, and confused guardians/morals. Although the brooding, artistic teen is a hallmark of independent films, I like the fact that this film introduced that such a reality can exist under such broken circumstances. By a fatherly presence constantly coming and going, as well as meeting the more psychotic influences, it is understandable how Mason can become a more introverted, emotional individual. This is an insight into modern American families than many more films (also, it is more an issue in California and New York, especially.) Perhaps I was reading too far into it, but these moments were when the film shined. The struggle for an identity admist a bland reality was executed a little stronger in American Beauty, in my opinion. The film does suffer from pacing issues, which sparked me to ask Sloss as to whether or not it was improvised. While every moment of Beauty seemed contrived and planned, Boyhood seemed more to portray realism over morals. I was informed this was the director's style, so I shall not take it too harshly. This film is a long one, but will keep you entertained.All in all, a very well done movie, 8/10.**NOTE** This film, according to Sloss, needs good marketing, so let your friends know about it (especially those writhing in suburban divorces and difficult situations.) This is a solid piece of drama that should develop a following with the amount of praise it will receive. It may alienate some (family lawyers included) but it should be relate-able to many."
BOYHOOD,25 September 2014,7/10,"I went to see Boyhood with extremely high expectations. The premise is certainly unique - the story of one boy filmed over a twelve-year period. And Boyhood is certainly a work of art. A true study of adolescence, it's a story made with an artist's eye that really captures the essence of growing up. The acting was phenomenal, and was really the standout in this film. I see a Best Actor nomination headed to Ellar Coltrane. Patricia Arquette also shone, and there really wasn't a bad actor in the movie.Despite all this, I couldn't help but be disappointed. When I go to a movie, I'm looking to be entertained, and Boyhood fell short of that expectation. I kept feeling bored. The movie is simply too long. Its running time is two hours and 45 minutes, which is at least 45 minutes too long. A movie has to be very good to exceed a two hour run time, and Boyhood just wasn't good enough.If you're a critical movie watcher looking for true art in a film, I recommend Boyhood. If you're just in it for fun, you may be better off watching this movie at home, where you can take some breaks."
BOYHOOD,24 May 2015,10/10,"This movie gave a remarkable look at how a family is not only believable but can be relative to a period in time. All families are different and the ebbs and flows in life can walk a fine line but each family has it's own unique reality and all in all, characters are usually true to themselves. I like how the parents interacted and dealt with time's marching on and how they would adapt to aging and their roles in their children's lives. Their children evolved in a character in solid way and it is appealing how they interacted with their peers and friends and family. Real people are what they are warts and all. The story is unique and the director effectively showed his vision. How could this not be enjoyed because it is the writer's point of view and the actors portrayed it as they believed the characters must have felt. It is somewhat like the documentary of the Loud family, but a movie version. I enjoyed it and found that the director did a fine job as well as the actors."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,1/10,"Because of all the positive hype, I hoped for at least a good film. I'm left wondering what it is I just don't get. So many good reviews? Even Mark Kermode says the young actor in the film has 'screen presence' and I think WTF! He's playing a boring so and so - he's not supposed to have presence.I'm not sure if there's enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes - seriously. Certain things like Ethan Hawk showing an empty wallet caught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through nearly 3 hours of this. I just don't understand how it won the golden globe for best film. Thankfully, there's a few negative reviews from like-minded people for me to know I've not gone completely mad!"
BOYHOOD,20 January 2015,3/10,"I found the idea of filming over twelve years interesting. However, this technique still requires good acting and story writing in order to produce an entertaining film, and in this regard ""Boyhood"" fails. The movie is BORING.The acting , other than that by Arquett and Hawk, was poor. I believe some or all of the kids were non-professionals, and it showed.The storyline was weak, unoriginal, and boring at best. At worst , it was unrealistic and sent a dangerous message for young men and boys. Most adult male characters were irresponsible, controlling, mean, abusive and their attempts to guide the kids were boorish and wrong.When one of the men tries to instill work ethic he is shown doing it poorly, and later he is unmasked as abusive and sick. In another scene, a father encourages his kids to not use the cheater bumpers as they are bowling to toughen them up. "" Life does not give bumpers"" he explains. Later, he sheepishly takes his lesson back after being lectured by his young daughter. I know it would be cool if little girls could be right when they argue with their Dads, unicorns and rainbows would be nice too, but the film was supposedly not a fantasy. Fact alert to Hollywood writers- ""adults have more wisdom and experience than children"". I don't know why this is so rarely portrayed in movies made in the past few decades.The Mother on the other hand is full of wisdom and kindness, and her unconventional path is shown to be the right one. Even though her son chooses a field which there is little chance to make a living at, and even less societal need for, the great American myth is repeated that ""you can do whatever you want and if you follow your dreams you will be happy "". In real life people who teach you to do work that society needs are actually the most helpful, but not to Hollywood screen writers it seems.I doubt all the kids in this film are going on to successful adult entertainment careers- maybe that fry cook job in the film will still be open!"
BOYHOOD,15 February 2015,9/10,"This film took 12 years to make (Thats a serious commitment) and the directors daughter has a lead role- aging in the film (for real). Not many directors other than Richard Linklater would get away with a theatrical release with such an extremely slow film (nevertheless every minute of this film impeccably reflects reality for reality's sake), and if you do not have children I would bet that this film would bore you to death. However, if you do have children, especially around the ages of 14-18 this film might surprise you and win you over past its half way point (and its a long one). I think Linklater has a thing with enforcing his female leads to gain weight during the process? (where as David Lynch just says, well you will have to be naked). Linklaters films show evidence to back this up. I can not speak for my 17 year old son's generation but I feel this film nailed it to a tee, and that is no easy task. As subtle as subtle can get, but meaningful and asking some very good questions. Linklater puts hope and optimism on the table for our children."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2015,9/10,"I selected to watch this movie after since it won awards at Bafta. Boyhood is story of every common man's. During the course of movie I felt as the twist and turns in movies is just what happened to me. But then I realized that it happens to everyone. The movie expressing hard reality of the modern life. Family, parents, friends, society, love, breakup etc. It's worthwhile to watch this movie. Some may find this movie boring if they can't connect the story to the reality of life. Movie raises many questions to an individual life's for which one need to find the answer himself."
BOYHOOD,14 July 2021,10/10,"There will be no new idea for film making after what Linklater did. I cannot find the words I need to express how good this movie was and. Maybe I should just thank the creators, Ethan Hawke, and Patricia Arquette."
BOYHOOD,21 March 2016,10/10,"I absolutely loved this film from start to finish and I am extremely grateful to whomever had this idea all those years ago. I was born in 1994 and have felt for pretty much my whole life that my generation got sort of jipped with cinema. Where other generations get to see their childhoods light up on screen, my childhood was filled with movies that were exploring special effects and stuff, so there's a tendency to surround a more surreal world (i.e. Harry Potter, lord of the rings, narnia etc). 50's, 60's, 70's and 80s babies can pretty much turn any film on and see their toys, shows, bicycles, whatever. Movie producers worked with what they had and parents were still kind of apprehensive about what their kids could see, so there was more family centered material. It seems like 1995-present have little to no realistic representation of our childhoods, at least not as I've seen. We have a bunch of Pixar films, stories about witches and wizards, superheroes, endless car films, And teen comedies. It's almost as if Hollywood has forgotten about those of us who grew up with robodogs, game boy sp's, moon boots, Lizzie McGuire, Polly pockets, green ketchup, so on and so forth. It helps that the kid was my age, but seeing the transformation over his years was deeply moving. The audience collectively likely streamed in their minds eye what they were doing during the years they were viewing on screen. Not all movies are going to be jam packed with explosions. What makes this movie stand out from the rest (aside from the interesting production premise) is its simplicity and gentle nature. Has every single day of your life been jam packed with explosions and rugged navy seals saving you from giant robots? No. In 2001 I was gazing at the sky. In 2002 I was browsing on a giant apple computer for the first time. In 2003 I was riding my bike every day with the neighborhood kids. The attention to detail was phenomenal- pay close attention and see meticulous planning. The acting was impressive. I'm more interested though in emphasizing the overall concept of the film. It was beautiful. And if the filmmakers ever see this, I hope they know that they produced an extremely unique and irreplaceable piece of art that encapsulates a generation film seems to have forgotten about. And obviously there is nothing we can do about it now except appreciate what we have. If you want to jump into a time capsule to the new to mid millennium watch boyhood, and appreciate the subtle, gentle beauty of it. You may have forgotten how special (yet under appreciated) that time was. If you expect 10 ft tall blue aliens, nonstop gun shots, or a soft core porn, you will be disappointed."
BOYHOOD,7 July 2017,1/10,"oh man...What a piece of s***1. the fact that it took 12 years to make this movie is on itself a gimmick 2. the director fell into a jar of clichés, are you ready, hold on tight:-student falls in love with professor -student marries professor -husband becomes an alcoholic -they divorce -student falls in love with professor again -student marries professor again -husband becomes an alcoholic again -they divorce again -boy meets a milf on a party that wants to have sex with him -boy meets the love of his life on first sight at first arrival on campus -yawn, yawn yawncliché after cliché after cliché...If you want to see an actual GOOD movie about teenagers growing up go and watch ""kids"" or ""Ken Park"""
BOYHOOD,17 November 2018,1/10,"The CONCEPT is unique sure...but that's all. It's boring. It's a regular troubled family. Oh, boy go to school. Oh, divorced dad take kids bowling. Oh, high school gossip. And who could forget that step-dad dinner tantrum? Actually there were 2 step-dads, both a little too forcibly evil. Maybe this ""10 year"" concept was doomed to fail?Even Birdemic tried harder than this. Massive flocks of attacking birds? Still more creative than this every-day family's life.I left a review of this a couple years ago on Netflix, but they recently deleted everyone's reviews along with the feature.This is yet another shining example of Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic being extremely flawed. Inflated scores that come from a tiny group of ""critics"" that are paid to be positive."
BOYHOOD,20 January 2015,1/10,"I am a bit of a cinema buff and I have seen quite a few efforts from all over the world dating back to the very dawn of the art form. This is worst film I have ever seen !!!! It looked like an amateur home video to me except it was much, much, much, much, much longer! Too absurd and stupid to be really boring however this pseudo intellectual psychological stink bomb probably is held in awe by lovers of Star Wars and Starbucks coffee. The only fun I had while watching this disaster was trying to guess how it would end. Well I also had fun laughing at how badly 'written"" this ""movie"" was so I suppose in that sense I have to admit it was enjoyable to participate in this flaccid collapsing 9/11 of cinema. I kept asking my girl friend ""when will this end?"" A few times I thought they were ready to pull the plug but no ... like Dracula it seemed to have eternal life! It kind of just petered out ""one day"" and I think that maybe they just ran out of money or someone pounded a stake through the plastic Kodak fixed focus they were using as a camera. They certainly didn't run out of ideas because there were none to be found. I am really astounded at how amateurish this piece of garbage was! Sorry I really can't do a more thoughtful profound review of this mess ... my brain just wont do it."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2020,4/10,Very boring movie about nothing. Good Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette... and thats ALL.
BOYHOOD,26 July 2021,9/10,"I've never watched anything so relatable,this movie is long,very simple nothing dramatic happens in the entire movie and that's why you feel as they are not performing a play but you are literally watching their lives closely .this movie will make you rememberer your life from your childhood to the day when you became mature."
BOYHOOD,30 July 2014,10/10,"One of the aspects of the movie that is very interesting: Growing up in a broken family, Mason lives constant stressful interactions with his parents and stepfathers. Many times adults are in their own world and they have little empathy. He doesn't like it. He has to cope. On the other hand he has very nice moments with his father who tries hard to be the best parent he can be. The mother tries too but it is a different story. Also we see some nice family gatherings. Beautiful movie that makes the audience experience the process of growing up. Richard Linklater took twelve years to shoot this film. This is breakthrough, something that has never done before,truly a master piece."
BOYHOOD,6 July 2021,7/10,"As an iranian t was one of the best film ive ever seen in my life and im sure i never forget this film for long time , and i read some of ur commends and i figured out of course it is a cliche movie for american people because u guys doing much more than this film shows in your life . But for us it is like a dream to have a gf cool friends dad who can sing a song can play guitar . Anyway when i watched it i wished i was born in america ."
BOYHOOD,2 August 2014,10/10,"My twin sons are one year younger than Mason. Watching the references (Gameboy, Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, etc) was like rewinding their lives and getting to watch it again. Only in this movie it was not fabricated. Linklater knew what fads/trends were in place as he was filming, and used them to perfection.But in other ways it felt like rewinding my own life. The soundtrack (excellent) lined up perfectly to the time periods. Seeing Roger Clemens on the mound for the Astros. Other references abound.Even though Mason is nothing like our boys, and there are many familial differences, this story felt so real that it almost could have been a documentary.Nothing too crazy happens- and that's great. Instead we meander through a ""real"" life and get to know the characters on a level I've never before seen.The acting is terrific. The task of Hawke and Arquette in particular were do daunting. How do you stay in character for 12 years, when you work on other movies in between? Remarkable work.This is must-see cinema."
BOYHOOD,25 February 2015,1/10,"I got little out of this movie. All characters, at least the adults, were narcissistic and selfish, which I realize is all too typical of Americans these days, but still, who wants to watch a movie about them? Movies are for escape, not for watching what you can see around you every day. I didn't like anyone in the movie and I felt sorry for the poor kids who had to grow up in a badly broken family (broken multiple times). I'm sure this happens all the time, but why would I want to watch a movie about it? Depressing. I kinda wanted to slit my wrists after it was over. I surely wanted the three hours of my life back that I spent watching it."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,1/10,"Here's the bottom line. I think there should be an exception for these IMDb reviews; considering there's really nothing of absolute revelation or a spectacular ""climax"". Everything you thought of going on in an ordinary person's life that COULD happen, happens. That's it. Again, this isn't a spoiler. You already knew what happens in this movie before even seeing the trailers; trust me. You're not missing anything. Stay home and watch videos of your own family through the years. You'll be happy you did.I will add that if Ethan Hawke wins the Oscar for Supporting Actor, I wouldn't have a problem with it. He did do a good job at the role."
BOYHOOD,25 February 2015,4/10,"Boyhood is Richard Linklater's, director of such modern classics as Dazed and Confused, School of Rock, and Bernie, latest Oscar nominated film which depicts a generally lazy, anti-ambitious and unmotivated boy named ""Mason, Jr."" (Ellar Coletrane) growing from a six year old child to a college-bound young man. To say that this was an ambitious undertaking on behalf of Linklater and his cast & crew is an enormous understatement, as the film was methodically completed over the span of twelve years. As far as film projects go, this is quite an arduous undertaking. With that being said, though, sadly, the concept IS the movie. It lacks any semblance to a plot whatsoever and with a run time of approximately 165 minutes, it is rather excruciating to watch.Being an Oscar nominated film, one would easily assume that it's worth a watch. Trust me when I tell you and be warned - It's two hours and forty-five minutes of your life that you're never going to get back if you do. Another word of warning, the following statement may contain spoilers. NOTHING HAPPENS! Except a boy grows up... That's it. Sorry to be so frank, but there was nothing that drove this movie. There was nothing for any of the characters to accomplish. No goals. No motivation. Sure, some interesting events happen throughout young Mason's life that are intriguing, but they're all basically resolved withing the scene that they occur in. Although the concept is amazing, the actual film is NOT, which is sad because it had so much potential. I couldn't make myself care for any of the characters, except maybe the father (Ethan Hawke), but even that is a stretch. Honestly if the kid had gotten hit by a bus when he reached Junior High and killed instantly - the end - roll credits, I wouldn't have cared. None of the characters solicited any kind of sympathy from me at all. As a filmmaker, you want your audience to care for your characters. Linklater fails in this regard miserably. The film doesn't even hold up as an ""artsy"" indie. It's not ""quirky"", either. It's not ""dark"" or even ""edgy."" There's nothing redeemable about it... or controversial. Once again - the boy grows up and watching it feels like it takes twelve years to complete. Ugh... it's painful.With that being said, there were some great things about this project that are worth noting. Patricia Arquette, who plays the Mother, won an Oscar for best supporting female, which is rightly deserved. As a matter of fact, all of the acting was superb and Linklater did a fantastic job at the helm as the director. The music cues the audience in superbly about exactly what time frame the film is referencing at any given time. There's also a really nice Pontiac GTO featured throughout the film, which gives it at least one star by default. Although I did enjoy the concept, have a great fondness for the acting, and everything else technically speaking, I'm pretty sure that I hated this film. I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend it for viewing."
BOYHOOD,1 March 2021,1/10,"Whoever says that this movie is the representation of life, I give you some advice ladies and gentlemen, go out and have a life, take an adventure, take a risk. Because if for you ""life"" is so frikin boring where nothing ever happens, you don't take risks, you don't fight for what you want, you don't get excited, you don't achieve, nor win, or loose , nor do you have high goals, that's just sad, as evidenced in this triple boring movie"
BOYHOOD,28 December 2014,4/10,"my personal boyhood review a movie made by a middle aged man about the boyhood Since obviously a teenager cannot make a movie about her/himself, this movie is gonna win the Oscar.. but .. we had already Mark Twain, why we need this sh. in our times? I mean, boyhood is an age when we all experience fantasies, dreams, the more we live out of the reality the better it is for the rest of our lives. If we pull out the magic imagination from our boyhoods, the rest of our lives is just a f@#!ING agony. If, because we are older now, we look at the boys and girls with our boring eyes, we doom the next generation to the same world of sh@#! we have been living since we forget our boyhoods. So, it's just a matter of terms, t the end. If this movie is all about the sense of frustration when we age, it's OK (the best scene is when the mother cries) but PLEASE don't think this movie is about boyhoods."
BOYHOOD,25 October 2014,10/10,"This movie is definitely not for those who watch movies for fun, because it is not a ""fun"" movie. However, If you are a serious student of movie or a person who can appreciate an intelligent, cinematographically meaningful film, you should watch this one. People talk about the twelve-some years of the making of this film. But it is much more than that. Everything in this film develops through time--characters, story, actors, and even directing. The basic storyline depicts the twelve years' coming of age of a boy. Yet, that story not only tells the growing up of the boy, but also wonderfully indicates the next stage of his life through the maturing of his father. So the film is really a story of about a half century, and covers two generations from the father to the son. Some viewers say that the movie was boring. But I believe that is exactly the point of the movie's excellence. In about three hours, the movie convincingly portrays that life is basically an unexciting series of struggles and routines with a due share of suffering. What the movie attempts to tell is a typical human life from childhood to middle age. At one of the closing moments of the movie, when the boy was leaving for his college, his mother cried that now she only had her funeral left. That may be an overstatement. But isn't real life an unexciting, boring journey to the funeral?"
BOYHOOD,18 March 2015,6/10,"What can I say... When i first time heard about this movie I thought Boyhood will take Oscar, because they were moving for 12 years and people always respect such things. but then i watched it... Now I understand why boyhood did not take Oscar for the best picture. The movie is good, but what I really don't understand is why this movie was nominated for Oscar. I Guess because of they were moving for 12 years, but still this movie literally simple and nothing really happens. I'm really disappointed, They just spent 12 years for nothing. I was expecting something special, but spent 165 minutes of my life for such a simple movie."
BOYHOOD,25 July 2014,8/10,"The idea of filming a movie over 12 years is incredibly innovative, even more impressive the perseverance of carrying it out! Seeing the boy's body, face, voice, everything change from over the course of two hours is incredibly satisfying, if not a bit creepy. The film is a very good one....but not perfect. The movie pays a price to the discontinuous filming and to the evolution of the acting skills of the main characters over the very long filming period. The acting of Mason's sister - Lorelei Linklater - is not so good, and also Mason - Ellar Coltrane - could be improved. I guess they just were normal kids that did not turn out to be outstanding actors. It is a very good movie, but it also makes it very apparent why filming with children and teenagers for over a decade poses some serious challenges."
BOYHOOD,31 July 2014,3/10,"I felt that a score of '1' would be too cruel. The acting is good; the years poured into creating this film are no mean feat; the way the film is made helps us to connect with characters as we see so much of their lives. Also, I feel that in its own artistic way the gruelling experience of life is portrayed well. However, this film became like pulling teeth as we drew to the end, for me personally. The film is very long, and there is no plot. There are several mini plots which the viewer may expect to lead on to something later in the film, but rest assured, none of them do. Aside from a few of the core characters, the cast is constantly changing, and the viewer is constantly mislead to believe that a character will be significant, when they are in fact not. The main character goes from being quite a likable child to becoming an energy-draining lifeless teenager and a depressing young adult. Many of the characters are fundamentally the same - same American style sassy attitude, same humour, same thoughts and personalities.I'm not a film fanatic, and this is the first review I've written. I consider myself to be fairly average in my expectations of films as well as in what I enjoy watching. Therefore, perhaps that is why my review is so different to the hype that appears to be going on here - I'm just completely different to these arty farty film nutters. It is for this reason that I am addressing the average person with this review. If you enjoy at least some of the more mainstream films (with plot, action, dilemma and an uncertain ending) then this ISN'T for you."
BOYHOOD,17 December 2014,9/10,"I intentionally chose the title of my review as Terrence Malik's The Tree of Life to highlight the similarity of content between both movies and to indicate the same sympathy for the human beings. The development of Boyhood has been well shot over 12 years. This way of story-telling just showed how short our life is especially during childhood. There are lots of instability and change in the lives of the family (the mother and her two children) in which the boy grows into a gentleman, caring, sensitive teenager. We perfectly understand how the relations and changes affect the character of the boy. Lots of loving moments are filmed while you can feel sad at some points.This beautiful film proves the main role of cinema and film industry in visualizing our life mainstream..."
BOYHOOD,2 February 2015,5/10,"I was so excited to see this after reading rave reviews, only to be very disappointed. I guess the attraction is being able to see the cast change over 12 years. But that's really all there is to this. Nothing of note happens. Even though its a very long movie, because it jumps ahead incrementally, there is never time to establish anything worth caring about. Too bad. It had potential. After seeing this, I am shocked that it is receiving awards for both the film and the acting. I will admit that it is fun to see the kids grow up. If that's all you're looking for, this is the movie for you. Personally, I wish I had that 3 hours back."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2014,9/10,"If you are ready to witness an extremely real & powerful story about growing up though the eyes of an average American boy, you are going to be blown away by ""Boyhood"". Whether you are a parent, family member or on your journey from youth to adulthood, there is so much to be felt by seeing this movie. It was filmed over 12 years with the same cast, which is quite groundbreaking & also turned out to be very emotionally impactful in a way that typical casting or makeup could never emulate. Ellar Coltrane is the lead character & his performance is so profound, that at times you forget that are watching a fictional movie & a not a documentary. Lorelei Linklater, who plays his older sister is also wonderful & really supports the emotional dynamic that is present between siblings. Ethan Hawke & Patricia Arquette also bring their very realistic characters to life. But the power & genius of this concept must be credited to the brilliance & dedication of the writer & director, Richard Linklater. He did not play it safe on the plot/story which really allowed you to connect with these characters & feel their pain/joy as they experienced it without predictability. It's very clear to see that Linklater's ability to take 12 years worth of filming and turn it into one seamless and extremely consistent work of cinematic art took a lot of vision & persistence. I'm betting that this movie will get many nods & hopefully lots of statues. I highly recommend that everyone at some point in their lives see this, but soon in the theater without distraction would be best. by Movie Cutie"
BOYHOOD,16 March 2016,4/10,"The 12 years life-journey shooting is a good concept just dropped into a very disappointing movie. I pretty much agree with everything thats being said here: no plot, and therefore no dramatic tensions nor dynamics. I understand it's suppose to be real life, but honestly most of our lives have much more twists or fun at the age of 18. The performance of this Coltrane kid is so apathetic and inexpressive that makes it impossible to relate with the main character. He even physically resembles to Hayden Christiansen and his acting skills are equally non existent. Editing is bad as well, with characters and situations coming out of nowhere and disapearing all of a sudden nonsensly just like that (did I mention no plot? oh, yes). Just four stars, mainly for the idea (terribly executed) and for Arquette's effort, which is rather good, but not Oscar winning material anyway."
BOYHOOD,2 December 2014,7/10,"The film is obviously overrated. It reminded me of ""The tree of life"" (2011) - I just couldn't see the essence of the movie that makes it valuable to watch. The life of a boy was highlighted just by the most usual things that happen in our life. And in the end it seemed like 12 years of nothing. For each of the characters - the son, the daughter and the mother (the father was the only interesting character and with decent acting). It's unnecessarily depressing.The mothers words in the end of a film ""And what next? My funeral?"" shows how generalized the human life is presented in this film. And no real story of life - just the sequel of events that are seemingly important.I didn't feel the nostalgia that I was told to feel when watching the film. Though I've grown up with Harry Potter too, I am a little bit older than the main character of the film. This past seems too recent and actually shows just the improvement of technologies and the growth of kids and parents getting older. I've experienced much more changes as a child of post-USSR.The film was entertaining though. With some sentimental pieces like in that scene when this worker says: ""Thank you for telling me to learn the English. You saved my life etc..."" and other ""no way..."" scenes that seemed detached from the context and added unnecessary banality. But the film kept my attention till the end maybe just because I was curious to see how those kids are gonna look and who will they become. 3 hours passed very fast but I didn't catch the feeling I was waiting for. I didn't get to the culmination of the story and there were no delight in separate scenes. Many films that take many actors for one role instead of filming same people for 12 years are much better and more nuanced.I could advise Boyhood to the people who are in the beginning of their twenties. Though the film is superficial it is a fine film and has some good qualities.Liene Narcis (English is not my native language)"
BOYHOOD,25 March 2015,5/10,"Im not in the mood to write a long review as having just watched this film I find that it has drained away all my energy so im just going to say this, Boring. Really, really boring. Oh apparently my review is not yet long enough so I guess im going to have to continue after all. The acting (with the exception of hawk and only hawk) was awful, the direction was awful, the story was ZZZzzzzzzzzz soooooo boring, The idea of filming a long story over a long span of time with the same actors and watching them age on screen is genius and admirable but i hope that the next time someone does it they don't forget that a film needs a story that is engaging, interesting and thought provoking. A much better and far more interesting film could of been made about my life and even based on the existing characters of this film if they had just focus more on more interesting parts of there lives."
BOYHOOD,14 August 2016,9/10,"Never before have I seen so many people investing so many years and time from their lives into one single movie. They must have really trusted that the movie would be a success – and how right they were to believe that!It's not even fair to call this a coming-of-age movie, or to put it in a category saying it's a drama. Boyhood is beyond that. This is something entire new, something no one has ever witnessed ever before. We get to see a young boy turn into a young man. The privilege of seeing something so personal in the course of 165 minutes is truly amazing.Some may argue that this is a slow-going and boring movie. Not everyone can appreciate this type in general, which is OK – ""different strokes for different folks"". But even if you are the type who normally don't appreciate this sort of movies, you should still watch it. Because there is simply not even a ""sort"" or ""type"" to qualify with Boyhood!Not trying to oversell the film itself, but rather the MAKING of it which I'm sure will go into history. And the movie is also great! There is an honesty so pure. It is naked and raw without overdoing it in any way. It is very simple yet so complex."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2015,3/10,"I was excited too see a movie that was filmed over a span of 12 years, as that was a pretty interesting concept. Watching the actors age before your eyes was a nice novelty. But is what this movie mainly is, a novelty. Hopefully this will be the end of the genre.This movie could be edited down to 2 hours without losing anything since there is so little to the movie anyway. The kid goes through issues just like you and me. Would you want to see 30 minutes of your life in 4th grade? Me neither. So we get 5 more of these vignettes, at various times during the kids life. His acting was nothing to write home about either. At least the 2 biological parents did a good job of acting, but the rest of the cast seemed to be going through the paces.If you have 3 hours to blow by, like a long plane ride, go for it. Otherwise your time could be spent much more productively watching something else, like maybe reruns of ""Breaking Bad""."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,10/10,"It took me two days to digest this movie, and after doing so I can proudly say that this is definitely one of my top 10 favorite films of this year, and honestly of this summer. Basically this movie is about a boy named Mason and major events that happen to him from the first grade all the way up to his first day as a freshmen in college, so 12 years. What makes Linklater such a clever film maker is the fact that he used the same actors the entire 12 years this movies was filmed, and he used year appropriate music from the years certain scenes were shot during. This does add on to a nostalgic feeling. To sum this all up, this is a good movie. Go and see it in theaters and then buy it on BLU-RAY when it comes out, also buy the soundtrack because it is amazing!"
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,4/10,"Potential spoilers This movie is not worth watching. The method of this making this movie seems avant-garde and above it all, but when you, the viewer, actually watch the movie you will barely care this movie was shot over 12 years and want to get down to the story and characters.This movie has no story and the characters comes out of a Lifetime movie or a teen novel.Boy grows up in a single mother home with an annoying sister and a mother that takes abuse. His father is the cool dad. He goes through a string of abusive step-dads. The boy becomes socially awkward and brooding.You will never know why the boy's mom and dad broke up. You will be introduced to a string of characters that will only last for 10 minutes but are supposed to have a major impact. You never know any of the motivations for any character besides the mother and son. Even then, you'll probably won't care.People will like this movie for the novelty of it and the nostalgia. There are a lot of period signifiers in the movie. Like songs, devices, elections. It will take you back if you are between the ages of 18 to 24.But when it comes to things that makes a movie...which is story and characters, it falls short."
BOYHOOD,30 November 2014,9/10,"Until now, all movies I have seen use different actors to show people growing along their lives. But I recognize persons by their stare. Even though you could find a second actor nearly similar to the first one, they will never have the same stare. And this is a fabulous movie if you consider only this technique of following people ""really"" growing. Specially Mason, whose stare and disquiet are outstanding, while he grows in front of our eyes from his childhood to his youth.A movie showing the beauty, the fight, the joy and the drama of a family that is recomposed in multiple facets. The director invests in the sensibility of the daily lives instead of big events. A wonderful project, it is definitively worth seeing."
BOYHOOD,4 March 2015,10/10,"Thank you so much Oscars! A bunch of ego-centric, self-loving, attention-needy group of people who feel the obligation to reward each other, have made history in what will be known as the year that ""They f***ed up"". This is a bigger rob than or at least as big as the one where ""Citizen Kane"" was not awarded Best Picture.Now, keep in mind that Boyhood is not one of my favorite films of all time or anything.But it's that grand, it's that important, and it's that different an experience that not recognizing it seems like a crime against humanity.Many people will tell you that this film is boring, that nothing really happens, that the characters just grow in front of your eyes. To those people, I should say ""THIS is life!""This is life at its purest, most boring and still beautiful state. How many of us feel like we just swift through the days without making a real impact?How many times have we done nothing but observe the world around us without saying a word that actually mattered? Does that mean we weren't real? Does that make your life seem pointless? Does that make you boring?The truth is, life is a very boring ritual connected through little flashes of fun, learning and experiments. It's those moments that help you get through the longer unimaginably boring hours awaiting.So, keep this in mind; Boyhood is definitely DIFFERENT but never pretentious.As far as the film is concerned, it more than anything feels like a recollection of the protagonist; the kind of things you remember about your life when you're standing on top of a mountain staring into a view too grand for you to digest; it's about the little things: the first time you got high, the first time you moved, the time you were bullied and so forth.The truth is, as Richard Linklater has masterfully shown here, they don't come off as much when you look back at them, but it was the same little things that have made you different from anybody else around you.Again, this is a film of moments, of recollections. But if I had to pick one as my favorite, it would be the scene with the teacher. It's so simple, so down to earth and so realistic it may as well be anyone's experience. It's easy to dismiss this as another one of those moments that just happened and didn't make a difference. But I like to think that it did, that it changed the protagonist's life around and that's why he remembers it.The actors here have done something incredible; Patricia Arquette's final scene is as electrifying as anything ever captured on camera; it's not an act anymore, it's life. Ethan Hawke is marvelous in a role so minimalistic it could've turned into absolute garbage or space filler but instead he turns it into one of the most joyous performances in a supporting role ever. Even the kid actors, who everyone seems to want to hate on, have done an impressive job. I'm specially talking about the Ellar Coltrane who has managed to grow in front of camera and still not feel like a forced entry every time we set eyes on him as a year has passed on.The real magic though comes from Richard Linklater, he turns away from his dialog-driven trilogy into a time-driven epic and he DOES NOT disappoint. Another aspect no one seems to want to talk about is the passage of time and culture, what other movie do you know that has managed to put in all this cultural reference into one pack? Technology, lifestyles, hairstyles, clothing, and most importantly music. This films contains such a wide range of music it almost feels like Linklater was dared to put all these genres into one film and yet, it feels natural: From Britney Spears, to Blink-182 to Yo La Tengo, nothing seems out of place. The same way that you look back at your life and wonder how you used to like Backstreet Boys and then Eminem and then Linkin Park and how now you listen to indie rock and mock all the aforementioned.At the end of the day, maybe this movie felt too close and personal to me to ignore. It was one of the last movies I watched with my family before leaving to come 10,000 miles away for 6 years; maybe that's why it felt so good to me.But at least I'm willing to admit this not like those piece of s*** actors and directors who decided it was OK to reward a film as pretentious as Birdman and ignore this humane gold!"
BOYHOOD,20 December 2014,3/10,"I'm giving this movie 3 stars out of 10, and each of those stars is strictly because the movie spans 12 real years. Besides that cool fact, ""Boyhood"" is incredibly lame. Actually, it's pretty much boring. And it's so long... it drags on and on. My husband says it was like watching a non-humorous ""Seinfeld"" episode- --the movie was really about nothing. So maybe if you like that kind of thing then you'll enjoy it, but I like some ""umph"" in my movies, you know? So kudos for the awesome 12 year journey, but I wish they would have done something interesting with the story. So much potential, but it didn't deliver. I honestly don't see how it could be so huge and well- liked beyond the 12-year production fact. So much potential wasted."
BOYHOOD,14 February 2015,10/10,"So the movie was shot in 12 years, that's hell of a record and it's the first thing that makes this movie special. The actors and actresses are ACTUALLY growing up on scene.The movie is a slow and soft piece of music, with really no climax and all, but every moment of it can be enjoyed profoundly. There are lots of rooms for deep life lessons that you can absorb from the life of a young, artistic, kinda weird boy, and everyone around him. It feels like human kind is still on the way of figuring out the meaning of life, this movie won't answer the question, you can never answer the question, but somewhere in this movie, hidden around the corners, you see the slightest clues of what life means, what you want to do with it, how to know who you want to be.I wouldn't be surprised if this movie gets the Oscar in 2 weeks, despite many bad ratings going on around it. It's a movie that takes patience and experience to truly understand and feel for."
BOYHOOD,7 September 2014,1/10,"I went to this movie expecting an incredible ""masterpiece"" as advertised. On a Saturday afternoon, there were about 25 people there. I was so very disappointed. This movie went on and on and on. So much so that I continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end. Would it ever end?? And then it kept going. While the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever, the film just needs major editing. It's the story of a boy growing up. There was abuse which was painful to watch, but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring. It goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts. It is just slow, long and boring. I seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back. I wasn't sure if everyone was in the same pain I was, but I also considered standing up and yelling ""when will this film ever end?""."
BOYHOOD,7 January 2015,6/10,"""Boyhood"" -- Or maybe it should just be called ""Bummerhood"". At one point the question is ask ""So, what's the point of it all."" I think quite accurately this films answers that question truthfully... there is no point. The movie was shot over an eleven year period of time. I'm not sure if Writer/Director Richard Linklater knew where this film would end when it began. Like life, it's a big series of diverging paths. -- I grew up at a time of massive social upheaval. What was considered a most difficult time. But after watching this, I think we were pretty damn lucky. And after watching this... I'm so relieved that I was never a parent... there is no point."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,10/10,"Boyhood is a roller coaster , you have your ups and downs and your side to sides and you never feel what's coming till it happens. Except this is an emotion coaster This is Richard linklaters best film yet. It is so well written and executed that you actually get drawn in and feel like a member of that family. This is a film that shows you that life is tough, but you have to figure out the right ways to make it better. I was so emotionally attached to this, that at the end when Ellar is driving the truck down the road to his campus and the a beautiful song starts playing, I shed some tears and you really reflect on what has happened for the last few hours and the emotions just pour out. This was an amazing film and it deserves everything it's getting, I hope you have a chance to see it. ~ Bryce Alec"
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,3/10,"I like films where nothing happens. One of my favourites is Jim Jarmusch's 'Stranger Than Paradise'. It's about a couple of bums who steal some money from a card game and then proceed to drive around a bit. Then they accidentally find some drug dealer's money, The End.In that 90 minutes, about a billion more interesting things happen than in this. It has style, a road movie feel, cool characters. That's how you make a film about nothing, and Jim J. didn't take 12 years to make it.It calls to mind a bit in 'Adaptation', where Nic Cage is complaining to his screen writing lecturer (Brian Cox) 'that nothing happens in real life, so what's the point of writing about it?'. Cox loses it, in exasperation at this ridiculous notion.It's like Nic Cage was afraid to make a film like this, almost completely devoid of any interesting moments (almost - there's probably about 10 minutes, to be fair. Still not good for a film spanning 12 years and that lasts 2 hours 45 minutes).Critics raved about it because of the technical achievement, getting lost in that and forgetting the fact that it's completely and utterly dull in all aspects of it's construction.It's solidly acted, but these people (Arquette, Hawke, both of whom I rate as actors) can do this stuff in their sleep. It plays like a drama you might watch one afternoon on some unpopular cable channel.Do yourself a favour and watch an actual film, with stuff in it."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,9/10,"Boyhood is the story of a family from Texas primary focusing on Mason (Ellar Coltrane) who lives with his mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and his old sister (Lorelei Linklater). The story starts slowly moving from scene to scene quickly only allowing a glimpse into their lives as the family moves to Houston so that Olivia can go back to school to finish her degree. In Houston we meet the children's father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) and really start getting attached to the family. The first hour or so of the film I kept expecting some major tragedy to happen but when this didn't I let go and enjoyed it. As the film progresses you become more and more attached to the family. So much so that you become a member of the family witnessing the events side-by-side with the characters. We get to see (and be apart of) the family struggle through everyday life events marriage, divorce, visitation, alcoholism, dating, drinking, drugs...everything while each member tries to find his/her place in the world. We also get to see them get older (I didn't know the film watch shot over 12 years when I watched it so I thought that some sort of CGI was being used). The strong writing and acting made the characters relatable, which is what gets you hooked. Everyone could relate to someone in the film. The excellent writing and directing also showed in scene development. Linklater (Richard) took the time to let the characters talk to each other for more than 30 seconds like many movies this year. Hawke's and Arquette's performances were outstanding with both becoming the Mason and Olivia for me. Coltrane just got better and better as the years progressed. The only criticism I have is casting of Lorelei Linklater. She looks nothing like either parent and lost the energy she had as a young child when she was a teenager. The ending was perfect! Boyhood is more than just 12 years of footage spliced together into film but is more like watching your own memories of your very own family on the big screen."
BOYHOOD,28 January 2015,8/10,"Boyhood is the undoubted favourite to win the Best Picture, Best Direction and Best Original Screen Play Oscars. I have watched the movie yesterday and I found it very good on the whole. Technically it was perfect and supremely innovative in terms of directing. Nonetheless, it was quite challenging to comprehend the ending. I understood that the movie wanted to show that all tiny moments in life affect us and make us who we are today. In a sense, what our parents did to us when we were kids, whether good or bad, affects us and shapes our reality and character as adults. This is a perspective widely accepted by psychology. A perspective which definitely holds truth yet a perspective which is a bit pessimistic. From a more hopeful point of view, the movie, perhaps, wanted us to understand that freedom comes from realising other people's influence on us. By doing that we can then claim our own identity, let go of the past and have the life we want. It is rare that a movie brings so many thoughts in my mind and for this reason I will agree that it is one of the best pictures of the year...!"
BOYHOOD,5 April 2020,10/10,"I've watched this movie 2 times, in 2014 and 3 days ago. I still feel the same for this movie. Sometimes things just happen the way we don't expect and some people, they're just gone without a chance to say goodbye. Sometimes, adults talk adult things that's hard to understand but the more we know as we grow up."
BOYHOOD,30 January 2015,9/10,"I went into this movie with a high standard because of all of the movie's nominations and awards that critics have approved as a deserving addition to this movie's accomplishments. I also had skeptics on the plot as it was considered to be basic and that nothing really happens. But, where it hit me most was at the end, where I could look back on these chapters of this kid's life that made it interesting and worth wild to have all these experiences that a normal kid should have. Of course, since the title of the movie is Boyhood, it focuses mainly on the boy's early life, but I feel that a diverse audience can find something relatable stir up some emotions as supporting characters effect and intertwine with the boy. The dialog also adds to the realistic, down-to-earth atmosphere that the audience can immerse in and feel comfortable in. Though, this movie neither focuses on really though times in the boy's life or even the greatest of his childhood; it shows how important the present moment is and to be able to look back on a memory and enjoy the life you have. Overall, this movie was something I thought about for a while. If a movie can do that, and sort of change me personally, I believe this to be worthy of its acclaimed recognition."
BOYHOOD,5 September 2014,9/10,"Boyhood is about a family, particularly the son Mason, and their journey throughout his boyhood. This film took 13 years to film, as they used the same actors all the way through. The story ventures from Mason's 5-18 years. We see his mother's struggles raising him and his sister, Samantha, as a single mother. She marries a few times, all of them ending horribly. The other important character in this piece is his father. We see him occasionally giving advice to his kids, and taking them out. This movie's genre is sentimentalism. It is about a family sticking together through bad situations. They also must do this with limited help from their real father. However they do stick together, and Mason is able to succeed. For him and his mother, his success is going to college. A secondary genre of this film is psychological realism. It takes a personal look at Mason, and his reactions to life around him. The most important dramatic element of the movie is actually character. The entire film is an in-depth look at Mason. It is about the different people, mostly family members, in his boyhood, and how they have impacted him. The next most important dramatic element in the movie is plot. The plot of this movie is a chronological look at Mason's growing up, and how he adapts to his environment. The plot also follows the main family unit around, throughout two marriages, and moving around the state of Texas. Mason is the protagonist of the film. His character traits and persona change greatly throughout the movie, as he actually ages 13 years during the filming. He begins as a wild, energetic child. As his character matures, he becomes thoughtful, friendly, nice, thoughtful and creative. Mason is multi-dimensional. As he ages he changes as a person, and we do not know how he will act. Another important character is the father. He is seen originally as unable to get through to his children and speak to them well. He doesn't know how to properly communicate with his children, but later in the film, he becomes better at being their father. He is a fun character. He cares a great deal about his children, and also their mother. The father is multi-dimensional, as we do not know what his next step will be. This film is written and directed by Richard Linklater. The lead role, Mason, is played by Ellar Coltrane. His sister, Samantha is portrayed by Lorelei Linklater, Richard Linklater's daughter. The mother is acted by Patricia Arquette, and the dad by Ethan Hawke. Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke often team up together (The before sunrise trilogy and others), and often make great films together. The Major Dramatic Question of the movie is ""What happens next?"" The movie leaves off at Mason's first day at college. We are left wondering how he will do in college. We hope he will continue photographing. The primary conflict of this piece is physical. It is all of Mason's troubles growing up. The conflict also pertains to his family having major issues. The soundtrack of this movie is very important. It features popular music from the year corresponding to each part of the movie. The songs help place the audience in the correct time period. The editing in this movie is quick. When the film skips one or more years into the future, it is immediate. There is no title card telling the audience about it. We just move to a different time. There is some basic cinematography in the movie. However one particularly well-shot scene is when Mason and some of his friends are rolling around the neighborhood on a skateboard and bikes. The camera is a dolly shot, as it wheels around in front of them. Most shots in this film are middle shots, as they are not from afar, and there aren't many, if any, close ups.The language in this movie is diverse. At first the language is simplistic as Mason and his family communicate in a basic manner, so he can understand and speak himself. When he matures, and gets older he uses profanity, and it is more explicit. During the movie there is various uses of colloquialisms and slang. The convention of time is greatly manipulated, as 13 years are fit into a time slot of less than three hours. Therefore time is condensed. There are edited jumps, that take us years into the future in less than a second during this movie. During this film the audience will be sucked in because the film is so realistic. It really is convincing. On a scale of verisimilitude, it is approximately halfway between the center and the photo realism side. It's believability is marvelous, and exactly what makes this movie original and fabulous. The movie is about a family sticking together. We see how the main family unit (Mason, Samantha, and their mom) handles abusive step-fathers. We see how they all react to the abuse differently. Also, it explores the bond between a father and son. This incredible film is a must-see. Although it is two hours and 45 minutes, not a single moment was worth editing out. Every moment of this movie is important and brilliant. The characters and dialogue are real and interesting. Everyone should see this emotional and fantastic movie. It fulfills the dual purpose of art, entertaining and instructing. It provokes plenty of emotion, whether that be fear or sadness for Mason and his main family unit while one of the step-dads abuse them, or pride, when Mason first arrives at college, this is an emotional film. It also instructs. We ask plenty of moral and motive questions about the father, Mason, the mother, and plenty of others throughout the entirety of the movie."
BOYHOOD,18 August 2014,8/10,"The acting was great but the editing was spectacular. Each year's worth of film blended seamlessly into the next..no fade to black, no pan and zoom, just gentle moving to the next year which helped make the story blend seamlessly.By the end of the movie, Ellar Coltrane even started to look like Ethan Hawke had in the beginning of the movie...almost making you believe they were son and father. Perhaps a lucky casting move, perhaps it was carefully researched. Did the casting staff look for boys who resembled Ethan Hawke as a 6 yr old? If not, lucky strike!Patricia Arquette aged with dignity, wrinkles and weight gains and losses (yes I know she was pregnant in real life in some of the scenes)and Ethan Hawke got some grey hairs. Lorelei Linklater matured and Ellar got pimples, greasy hair and in the end, one of those huge ear piercings. All this made for the whole 12 years seeming so natural..like watching a family ebb and flow through life's normal and sometimes not normal situations. I did find myself holding my breath on several occasions thinking 'don't do that!' and many times it reminded me of fears I had as a mother when my kids were teenagers.The positive message was to me, that in this day and age of 50% divorce rates and split/blended families being blamed for many problems in society, THIS family held it together by having two parents, albeit somewhat dysfunctional parents, who truly loved their kids. Love does make for a better world."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,10/10,"What a brave director ! Keeping far enough from Hollywoodism, this is an excellent American movie, which shows the normal real life. Yes, it took 12 years to make this masterpiece. It shows the changes in the society, lifestyle and everything, with some smart connections to the main twists in the world in recent years. I believe some scenes will be remembered after years. Some dialogues were also memorable. Ethan Hawke's acting has been brilliant in this movie, alongside the main character and his sister and mother. Since this movie is a pioneer of its own, I consider it perfect. One of the best movies in history, and probably the best in the recent years. 10/10"
BOYHOOD,13 July 2014,9/10,"*This review is spoiler free. Boyhood is a unique coming of age piece which was filmed over a period of 12 years with an exceptional cast and outstanding performances. It tells the tale of a young, whimsical and abstract minded boy and his journey from the age of 5 to 18 alongside his mother, father and older sister.The most captivating feature of this film for me was both the director and cast's commitment to a 12 a year project. This was a very brave and commendable approach that produced a worthy result. I think the continuity of the actors (and also to witness their natural aging over the years) made for greater attachment to the characters and an overall enhanced movie experience. It also adds a very refined sense of reality which emanates an unusual documentary-like feel to the film which ultimately brings it to life! I agree the 3 hour duration can be a bit uninviting but I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it! It's important to consider that this is meant to be 12 years of someone's life. By the end, you may just find yourself questioning whether that running time does justice to it. I think this film reiterates the cliché that life REALLY IS short. But within that short space of time a lot can happen and a lot can change. Over the years, I believe cinema has been lacking a great sense of reality (and don't get me wrong, the whole 'suspension of disbelief' is greatly entertaining) but sometimes we need to be drawn back into our world. Boyhood is an artsy portrayal of the normality of life and exactly how it is. It can be cruel, it can be tough but it can also be truly amazing. Boyhood is as real as it gets. Highly recommended. 9/10"
BOYHOOD,5 September 2014,10/10,"When someone tells me ""words cannot express..."" I typically laugh at the absurdity. As a writer, I conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything. However, I must bow to this cliché. Words cannot express what I think of Richard Linklater's Boyhood. Given that it's been a little over 12 hours since I saw the film and I'm still speechless, I ask you to bear with me in this review. I WILL MONOLOGUE! To state that Boyhood is the best film of a year that's not but ¾ of the way through is a stretch, but I find myself limber in this instance. Boyhood is the best film of the year. Now time to stretch some more... Boyhood is the best film of the decade. Still limber. No stretching needed. This movie is THAT incredible.It all began with an innovative idea from the already innovative Richard Linklater. What if we see a family grow and age through the eyes of a child? And what if we shot it in real-time? From there a spark was ignited and eventually came to a glorious flame. We do see a family age, for 12 years! This idea is already a selling point for the film, but then throw in Mr. Linklater's usual touch of heart and authenticity and you'll have something undeniably special. You'll have an intimate epic. A film that is so large in a technical scale, and equally large in emotional sale is something hardly seen. Especially in the past 12 years. So when Boyhood premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, there was a lot hype. And this excitement hasn't expired after several months. Instead it has grown. It has traveled through America crafting an astute reputation for the film to follow. So for film-goers like myself, who live in small, un-artistic towns, find ourselves overwhelmed with praise for a film we must wait for. And we did. I personally waited a full month-and-a-half for this film to hit El Paso. But 6 weeks is nothing compared to 12 years, so I shall cease my complaining. Instead I shall say this, Boyhood's reputation precedes itself.As the film opens were are introduced to Mason, the central character. The ""boy"" in boyhood. He is six years old, and the year is 2002. This is when we begin our 12 year journey with him. At the end of the school day, Mason is picked up by his mother Olivia (an electric Patricia Arquette). Early on in the film we get a sense of the living conditions of Olivia. But, instead of shifting the narrative towards her, we stick with Mason, and remain oblivious to the full condition of Olivia's life. In many instances, there is nothing heard or seen that Mason isn't hearing or seeing. If his parents are fighting in the next room, we don't see it, because Mason doesn't see it.After a few minutes, Mason spends time with his father (Ethan Hawke at his finest). Mason, Sr. is just what you'd expect. He's your typical absentee dad, one who only shows up with gifts and fun, but never seems to be serious about raising a family. However, since we see things as Mason does, this dad is awesome and greatly missed. At this point, the plot becomes clear. This is a film about a broken family. To scrutinize the plot would be to write an 11-15 page review. There is so much going on within each year of the film that the 12 year story is impossible to break down into a simple synopsis. After the first 12-15 minutes of the movie, the film cuts to a new year, 2003, and we find the characters have moved on from the last. This process is continued throughout the entire film till we reach adulthood in 2013. And with this formula, a masterpiece is crafted.There is something so psychologically groundbreaking about this film. Never before has a film been so relatable, so memorable, and so poignant. As each year appears on the screen, we the audience subconsciously immerse ourselves into the same time period. We recall what we thought and did in that year, and find ourselves nostalgic. This feeling is especially effective for members of Mason's generation, like myself. We recall the same thought patters and experiences Mason goes through as we went through them. With this intimacy, we find ourselves reliving our childhood. This beautiful feeling is something no other film has caused. This is why Boyhood is so groundbreaking, because it is able to captivate its audience and allow us to have a relationship with it. What Mr. Linklater has done is not only craft a work of art, but allow the audience to view the crafting of the work of art. Brick by brick, line by line, side by side, for anybody involved in this film, whether it be the filmmakers or the audience members, there is an intimate, one-on-one feeling that transcends both time and reality. And for that, we are indebted to the filmmakers. Being Mason's age myself, I find Boyhood to be a very special film that is incredibly close to my heart. As I sat in the theater, watching Mason head off to college, I suddenly realized that that was me. I too had just transitioned into adulthood, and started a new chapter in my life.Epic in both a technical and an emotional scope, Boyhood defines a generation by allowing the audience to go on their own intimate journey with the characters. Though the film is a rough 3 hours long, you feel as if it lasts the whole 12 years, simply because you are reliving the period yourself. Boyhood is the type of movie you don't want to end because there is something so deep in the connection it made with you. This I can say with no reservation. Boyhood is one of the most unique, personal, and authentic films I have ever encountered."
BOYHOOD,31 August 2014,5/10,"There was a heavy relation to the American Dream in this film. I found it a bit exhausting learning of every characters credentials. I thought that it was ridiculous that the first husband was an 'associate', and then the migrant worker was inspired by the mother's words 'go to night- school' and now he is an associate. I mean - come on! There is such a heavy push in American films to become academic. The mother of course goes back to school to complete her masters in psychology. What if college doesn't happen - that would be a more interesting story.On another note, I found the teenage girls in the film completely unrealistic. They all looked like Sports Illustrated models and all acted turned on by every guy - It's a very poor representation on women in general. American girls are going to see this film and think 'this is what i'm supposed to look like?' 'This is how i'm supposed to act/flirt around guys?' If i'm cool then I need to smoke weed and hand out magic mushrooms'. The only profound wisdom the film imparted was at the end when the father said that life is just about 'winging it', a sentiment that the mother had not come to grips with. In her mind, she pushed herself through every milestone she thought she was supposed to, like getting married, having two kids, and completing her education. I think she believed that if she became what she though was expected of her to lead an estimable life then she would be happy at the end. The reality was she was an empty nest'er in a small pokey apartment, with no boyfriend let a lone a husband."

The Movie Of A Lifetime! 'Cameron Ruse"
BOYHOOD,14 September 2014,7/10,"Boyhood is definitely one of the best films of 2014. It is so impressive how a cast and crew managed to remain dedicated to creating this story over twelve years. Now that is a cinematic achievement. Boyhood is a breath of fresh air in the film industry - we've been seeing all these films lately with overdramatised, and sometimes silly, story lines and cardboard characters. This film is raw and original. The characters and the situations they find themselves in are extremely relatable and are present in our everyday lives. We see these characters grow up right before our eyes, and it's kind of magical.This film is a very special experience and one that you don't want to miss."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2015,9/10,"You just know that its a great movie when a large portion of the scores have 1-star rating while the rest consider it among the most precious jewels. This movie doesn't rely upon funny quotes, cool action or ""dream within a dream"" mind bending storytelling. It doesn't try to teach you a lesson or establish the same old dictionary of morals. And that is because it doesn't have to. In this nearly 3 hours long story about somewhat ordinary life, every single line of dialog is carefully crafted to create a beautiful journey through time. This movie doesn't demand that you sympathize or look up to any of the characters, instead it highlights key elements from our society and daily choices that might or might not have long term consequences. And that is where the true beauty of this masterpiece is hidden, a rare chance to witness 12 years of events and choices unfold before your eyes is a very subtle, almost ordinary way (don't be fooled though).One thing is certain, this movie is way ahead of its time. Cinematography is still in its early stages of adolescence and not every viewer is yet comfortable to take a step into unknown, but that's cool. After all, rarity is what makes a fruit exotic"
BOYHOOD,14 February 2015,7/10,"At nearly 3 hours long, this groundbreaking film takes us through the life of a young boy and shows us how he grows to become a man. Most people have heard about the fascinating way this film was made, where they used the same actors for twelve years. Because of this, the movie really makes you feel as if your watching this boy, and his family, grow. The directing is well done, the acting is good, and the movie well deserves every Oscar it wins, although it wouldn't be my pick for best picture.However, the film is still missing something. When I first watched Boyhood, I found myself,sometimes, losing interest. Although the film is very well made, it was missing an important element that a film, like this, needs. It was missing the emotional depth that a great film needs to have. There was no lesson to be learned, there was no moral value, it was just a film that told the story of a boy's life. There were moments where I felt the emotion, the pain and happiness that the characters were feeling, but those moments were too rare for this long movie. For average movie goers, I don't think they would really enjoy a movie this long that only partially satisfies. Also, must people go to the movies to forget about the troubles of life, and this film doesn't accomplish that, at all."
BOYHOOD,19 November 2014,5/10,"The concept of this little film is actually brilliant, filming the entire movie in a span of over a decade so the audience gets to see characters age over time. It feels a lot like time-lapse photography, time is sped up, yet things are taken one moment at a time. But a brilliant concept alone does not make a masterpiece.Unfortunately other than concept, nothing else is stuck me as brilliant. Some parts are good, but often the very same parts fail to follow through.There are many conflicts introduced into the story that have no resolution, and a lot of the problems faced by the characters seem to have magically been solved, or forgotten as the movie approaches a new direction in its overly long narrative.For instance, at one point this mother of two is in a, seemingly wonderful relationship with a charismatic, seemingly decent, single dad and the next minute, with out explanation I dare say, this same guy becomes portrayed as a drunk who drives away the entire family. Then the exact same thing happens again with another guy down the road.There is also bullying scene, the baptism scene and a lot of others events that you might think would affect the outcome of the story, but latter only be proved to be insignificant fillers that doesn't really add anything to the story or its outcome.Basically the movie is about a whole bunch of sub-plots without any concrete follow through. Each sub plot starts out intriguing, promising even, and then leaves you hungry for more. But the thing is, it never satisfies that hunger - it starts over with another appetizer, another sub plot with out a main dish. The movie does not feel like watching a person's life but a bunch of trailers of his life put together.Overall the concept is brilliant. And anyone who has seen this film will appreciate the effort, dedication and patience required to create such a film. One might say one could sense something special in such a dedication. On the other hand one can not but feel that there is something lacking as well, and I am not talking just about missing parts."
BOYHOOD,23 September 2015,1/10,"By far this has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Maybe because I had seen some of this boy's boring life in myself, I don't know. I got the movie because of all the academy buzz and am thoroughly disappointed. The movie meandered all through out this boys life, which would normally be a good thing, but never pulled me in. There is a point near the end where I looked at the cover of the movie and it said ""Drama"" on it and I hoped the kid would drive off in the ditch or something. But really an uninteresting kid, with typical kid attitudes, doing kid things. I thought the acting was good by the parents and even the older sister."
BOYHOOD,8 December 2015,9/10,"Boyhood avoids many of the pitfalls Hollywood cinema such as a neatly- packaged conclusion or contrived plot lines. It was just typical life – in all its pointlessness and ephemeracy. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are terrific. One of the most interesting sub-plots of the film is the evolution of the father from chain-smoking, absent deadbeat dad into a strong, reliable family man. Meanwhile, the courageous single mother admirably pursuing the perfect career and family, ends up bitter and unfulfilled despite achieving her career goals. I also loved Linklater's technique of ""holding a moment"" a little longer than usual to convey the character's true emotions. A great scene where Arquette and Hawke are having an ostensibly amicable conversation at Mason's graduation, when the father offers to contribute to the cost of the party, only to check that his wallet is empty and he needs to get money from his wife. Arquette smiles softly which turns into a pained expression of almost exhaustion. I think what Linklater is saying is that things are never buried in the past. Moreover, the film throughout the actions and dialogue of its characters didn't move in the directions Isuspected it might – there were moments of palpable intensity punctuated by mundane vignettes. Spray-painting under a cement bridge (another signpost to Mason's artistic calling), painting a house,bowling with dad, baseball or sporting events, being confronted by bullies (both at home and at school), marijuana in the backseat of a crowded wagon, beers in an abandoned house, graduation, the first break- up, fatherly pep-talks and moments of drug-induced (but real) illumination. There are very rarely goodbyes. You just move from one moment to the next never fully knowing which ones are important, but I think the film as selected some truly important moments of Mason's life and how they have shaped him. I read one review which remarked that it was Mason Jr's integrity throughout the film which made it so endearing, which I think is true. I even think Linklater's daughter was great as Samantha, very similar to Mason. Strong and resilient, but slightly aloof. The way she baits Mason with a great throwback to the early 2000's (obviously at the time it was contemporary) singing a Britney Spears song, and speaking in a made-up language. She certainly added a level of humour to what was otherwise quite a bleak family situation. I found this a very realistic depiction of how siblings interact, particularly as they reach adulthood in that there is an awkward but understood bond that is largely unspoken. One of the strengths of Linklater's direction is his ability to capture of cultural essence of the time and granted it was easier to do this in Boyhood because it was filmed in real time. But his debut film, Dazed and Confused, for a high school ""stoner"" movie is acclaimed for its accurate representation of dreary suburban, middle-class high school American culture. Many of the same themes (on a wider spectrum) are also represented in this film. It's this attempt to capture the cultural trends which have some people labelling this film as ""Democrat propaganda"" referring to Ethan Hawke having his children campaign for Obama leading into the 2008 election. The scene involves the children visiting two neighbours. One is an elderly, bigoted Republican neighbour (with a visibly displayed Confederate flag in his garage) and a young woman (Democrat supporter) who is polite, attractive and not particularly bright. Some might say the film is perpetuating stereotypes here, but aren't clichés are clichés for a reason? Once again, I'm not from America and have never been to Texas – and yet I know having followed the election campaign on television that the Republican Party fostered bigotry among their constituents by constantly referring to Obama as ""Barack Hussein Obama"" (as the Republican neighbour does) and thereby egregiously implying he was an Arab. Meanwhile, Obama was black, attractive and made him a perfect poster boy for (particularly) young voters. If anything is being represented here it's the superficial nature of modern politics. I don't think it was at all controversial to select these two people to represent those demographics of the time. It also briefly touches upon the Iraq War, as the Mother re-marries a former soldier who served – who returns a dissident, eventually drunken and jaded. Again, I think this only highlight a fairly common experience for many soldiers returning from combat in Iraq. Interestingly (and again, an example of the unpredictable narrative), Mason Sr. marries into a conservative Christian family. They exhibit stereotypes of conservative Americans in the south, such as being devout gun-owners. But the film makes no judgment here. The step-family do not seem to take issue with Mason's politics or his illegitimate, alternative children. The rifle-shooting scene for example – Mason Jr enjoys it. It's an unlikely bonding session between two people who probably have little in common, which makes it a great one. I found this film to apolitical, if anything. It briefly referenced a significant event in America's history and made no judgment (or even reference) to the myriad of social problems in Texas, which it certainly could have if the film's mandate was political. The scene where the Mother is approached by the Mexican who replaced a drainage pipe on her house, whom she unwittingly inspires to attend community college and become a restaurateur, was the only red flag for me. It was a contrived chance encounter and seemed dissonant with the rest of the film. Perhaps, Linklater was trying to illustrate that we underestimate the effect we have on people, but this was not particularly subtle. Life's series of moments; the good, the bad and the miscellaneous - that's what Boyhood was about and was executed patiently and with masterful precision."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2015,9/10,"When you hear about the premise of the movie boyhood you might be quick to assume it's boring. You see a young boy grow up. He moves a lot, deals with a few drunk step-fathers, and eventually goes on to college. What makes this movie so interesting is that you actually do see this boy grow up. You see him and everyone around him change over the course of 12 years. Yes, there is no major excitement, but they chose to focus on the parts of this boys life that shape him into the person he becomes. They don't show his first day of school, or his graduation, because those aren't the events that changed him. Boyhood is especially relatable to younger viewers like myself, who are getting ready to go off to college. It was a look back in time, that ended at where I'm soon to be in my own life. Even if you don't personally relate to the movie it's easy to appreciate the unique style of filming. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
BOYHOOD,6 October 2014,,"Despite its length, the movie held my interest throughout. It was natural and down to earth. Ethan Hawke gives a wonderful performance as the father and his character grows. Initially, he is rough around the edges and absent but he returns and bonds with his kids as well as becoming more responsible. Patricia Arquette as the mother was a bit of a train wreck. Although she loved her kids she made many poor choices and was not a very good mother. Interesting that husbands #2 and #3 had a common problem. I want to tell the director/writer that once is enough, twice is overkill. The two young people do very good work although they were not especially likable. Overall, I did enjoy the movie but the director resorted to the Hollywood view of flyover Anerica by making the step grandparents cartoon figures devoted to guns and the Bible. Also, the man who did not want the Obama sign and threatened to have Mason shot was ludicrously clichéd. Mr. Linklater should get out of Hollywood and meet some real people"
BOYHOOD,7 April 2018,1/10,"God where to start here? I can easily say this was the most boring film ever made! Linklater basically directed something so his daughter can have memory of growing up and that is it! Characters are dull, acting pacing and anything that makes one film a film is completely absent! Story is about uninteresting family with uninteresting lives and who ever calls this an artistic film is a complete idiot! Anyhow don't waste 3h of your time on this because you will hate cinema for life! This film makes you hate Cinema!"
BOYHOOD,24 August 2014,10/10,"I was fascinated with the idea of a film that took 12 years to make. Every year, director Richard Linklater would gather the cast together (Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arguette, Lorelei Linklater and Ellar Coltrane) and film for a few days. The resulting film shows us the natural progression of life, which is especially noticeable as we watch the children growing up before our very eyes. Ellar Coltrane is Mason, who we meet at age 7 and Lorelei Linklater is his slightly older sister. Their parents (Hawke and Arquette) are separated and it is obvious to us that the children would prefer their parents living together with them in the same house. We watch blended families come together and fall apart. We watch Mason Sr, the non-custodial parent, make valiant efforts to remain engaged in his children's lives. We watch Olivia trying to better her life through education and then make bad choices in relationships. It all happens very naturally. This is like real life on film. Mason and Samantha grow up, become teenagers, graduate from high school and go on to college. The film concludes as Mason is making new friends while moving into his college dorm room at UT Austin. I would have enjoyed watching him navigate his college years. I wasn't expecting or needing to be ""blown away"". In fact, what I found to be extraordinary about this film is its ordinariness. I would watch this again and hope I get to."
BOYHOOD,28 February 2018,10/10,BOYHOOD. IT TOOK TWELVE YEARS TO MAKE. TWELVE YEARS. TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE? THAT DIDNT TAKE TWELVE YEARS TO MAKE.
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,9/10,"Just like the story-line, this movie grows on you little by little, i started watching it without much expectation but seeing the characters grow older, evolve, mature, really brings you inside the film. The body expressions of Mason and his sister are true and pure a all times, even after the 13 years they stay the same, the infinite looks at nowhere. I can see why all the buzz around this movie, it is unique in every single way, every little kid growing at that time can identify with this movie, it is just life summarized in 2:40 hours. The evolution of Ethan Hawk's character is amazing, growing from a single, cool, carpe diem dad with a GTO to a married, semi-religious guy driving a minivan. But is essence was still there, at the last scene of him and Mason he talk to him just like at the beginning of the movie. Summarizing it in a few sentences, ever Boy can identify with this movie, just brings a smile in your face during some particular scenes, and especially at the end."
BOYHOOD,6 April 2018,3/10,One of the most Overrated films in history & its sooooooo boring.
BOYHOOD,4 July 2018,9/10,"I loved Richard Linklater's approach with filming the movie. The audience literally sees a kid grow up on screen. This movie is not for the average movie goer. Most people these days watch movies to either see explosions or to get a laugh. I can see how some may think of Boyhood as boring, but I found it interesting. During the movie I felt attached to the characters and I would say that the characters are the most important part of this film. I am not an emotional person, but I found myself tearing up at a scene where Ethan Hawke's character is playing football with his two kids in a park. The scene was simple yet touching. It's these little moments that make Boyhood special. The only disappointment I had with the film was the acting, particularly with Lorelei Linklater (who plays Samantha). Lorelei Linklater was bland."
BOYHOOD,4 October 2018,4/10,"Critics seem to have been completely won over by this film and, frankly, that dumfounds me. It's pretty clear that the reason can be boiled down to it's interesting but gimmicky concept: it's filmed over 12 years. The focus of every single piece on this film since it was released. I'm yet to see a single review that does not mention this. It's apparently the only thing that they have to say about it. For me, if a film utilises a gimmick, the rest of the film must be at the same level and elevate beyond that one factor. Boyhood does not. I'm not saying that the film is without its merits. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are great as Mason's parents and it is interesting to witness the passing of time and pop culture as the years go by. BUTThese are perhaps the only positive things I can say about the film. It comes across as merely a fragmented and loose series of snippets which we are expected to just come together but they don't. It is dreadfully overlong, which would not be a problem if the film had content to fill the running time with. Each scene seems to be building towards something and then doesn't deliver, and what is meant to come across as genuinely heartfelt moments from childhood come across as melodramatic and soap-opera in delivery. Boyhood is simply surprisingly lacking in interesting content. Linklater tries to address the 'bigger questions' that a boy growing into a man would go through, but it comes across as high school level philosophical drivel. I enjoy his other work, especially the Sunrise trilogy, but the fact that this is now seen as his masterpiece is a real shame. Most importantly of all, the film gives us no reason to follow this main character, especially for three hours. Mason, as portrayed by Ellar Coltrane, is simply not at all interesting, merely acting as a vessel to witness the events of the film rather than being a fully fleshed out character. I'm well aware that the film is meant to portray the ordinary which isn't my criticism, but it is possible to portray the ordinary in an interesting way without coming across as flat and boring. The fact that Boyhood has 100 percent on Metacritic is beyond me. It's quite possibly the most overrated film of the past few decades. I went into the cinema expecting a truly emotional, life affirming experience but came out feeling unfulfilled. I really do not understand the ecstatic reviews of this pretentious, dull film."
BOYHOOD,2 February 2020,5/10,"Very disappointed in this movie,so long,boring at times and I am totally amazed Patricia Arquette got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as I think it was her worst movie ,"
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,5/10,"After reading all the great critical reviews and seeing the high IMDb rating, I was expecting to enjoy this movie. Then I realized it was 2h 45m long. Yes, the aging of the same characters was creative, but it has been done before across multiple movies (Harry Potter movies). I just kept expecting there to be more, not the same ole thing, age-change after age-change. I kept thinking, ""What am I missing?"" All those 100 scores from critics and yet, if it wasn't for the aging progression, I feel like they would have bashed the movie for being predictable and repetitive. And the abrupt ending, man was that a let down. I'd like my 3 hours back, please."
BOYHOOD,4 March 2019,7/10,"I think the same effect could've been the same at two hours. i think this movie is pretty over rated, and the only technical achievement was that it was filmed over time, there really isnt anything mesmerizing here."
BOYHOOD,30 November 2021,8/10,"You know it's going to be a great film when it starts with a Coldplay song.This might sound insane despite its length of 165 minutes but I loved this, it's one of the best coming of age movies of the past years and the fact that it took 12 years to film this just makes it such an experience."
BOYHOOD,29 April 2019,6/10,"May not be the most fleshed out when it comes to answering the character's development, but it's contained so many resonant with me moments, that I've really needed by the way, that I can't just skip it as a significant movie that you may just watch whenever feeling lost. I watched it once, planning to watch it at least once more."
BOYHOOD,26 August 2019,9/10,"Shot over 12 years, this 2 hour 45 minute film manages too fly by, by the ending I wanted to see a little more, because the boy's journey to a man is fascinating and enthralling. But what makes this movie really special are it's themes of lost fathers, growing physically and metaphorically and the point of life itself. There also the little things, like Mason's hair changing with each transition. Overall, defiantly worth the watch because no other film has pulled off a feat like this."
BOYHOOD,14 May 2020,10/10,"I watched it with my friends, which wasn't a good idea. Most of them fell asleep and found it boring, the reason is it is the most real and moving movie I have ever seen. Since it follows this Mason Jr's live until he graduates with the same actors of a 12 year timeline, it doesn't seem forced or fake. It is the best indication that even though movies take people out of real life, they can make people think of real life as well, which many movies haven't done that to me the extent that Boyhood has done.Also I would advise to watch alone unless you are watching with a movie buff because a lot of people can ruin the experience of this masterpiece"
BOYHOOD,25 April 2020,8/10,"For some people could be boring as it is a movie of 2h for really no action happening. For me it was really good, not like it changed my life too. It was somehow nostalgic and in some ways I could relate and understand what was going on.
To be honest, I though it would be different, and with more drama in some parts , but then prettu intense in others."
BOYHOOD,3 August 2014,4/10,"If you haven't heard already, this is a coming-of-age movie that uses the same actors for a period of about 12 years. It presents a slice-of-life that offers very little in the way of depth or subtlety. It's nice that the filmmaker took 12 years to make this film however should have spent more of that time working on a story line that I found to be disconnected for the most part and lacking in import and meaning. The story was thin and consisted mostly of transitory moments that most of us experience in life without giving them much consideration. Because these moments are just-life, documenting them in film doesn't elevate them, but merely records them. It's not like we haven't seen child actors grow into a role over real time - ""Facts of Life"", ""The Cosby show"" or the same actor represented through different periods of life - ""Truman story"", ""Forest Gump"", ""Castaway"". The problem with this movie is that there is little in the way of real story to tie the vignettes together. It is light, superficial entertainment. If there was makeup involved and different actors playing the greater age disparate roles I feel this movie would not be getting the accolades that it is getting. While it is too long and too hyped it thankfully isn't too hard to sit through for the most part though it has its tedious and tiresome moments. There are some interesting scenes and situations for sure. The drunk, abusive father takes the cake for me. The acting was solid and natural.And what is the take home from this movie? Growing up sucks at times but if you put your nose to the grindstone, follow you heart and expect some disappointment you will turn out OK - what this movie was for me."
BOYHOOD,10 February 2015,10/10,"If ""Boyhood"" came to our theater in Topeka, I must've missed it! I've been on a quest to see this year's nominated films, so Janet & I finally rented ""Boyhood"" on Amazon Prime Instant Video. Great (historic effort) movie! I can see why Hollywood insiders have nominated it for a Best picture Oscar. I give it all 10 STARS - not so much for its story (there isn't much of a main point running through all 12 years) but for its never-been-done-before achievement! Rent it if you get a chance - but be aware that it is rated ""R"" for a lot of profanity. That said, I do think that the Harry Potter films did something similar, by casting the same 3 lead actors (and some others) during 8 movies over a 10 year period!"
BOYHOOD,22 August 2015,8/10,"Right from the opening shot when we have Patricia Arquette casually walking towards her 6 year old son, completely oblivious of the camera or the pace associated with this medium, we realize that this is no ordinary cinema. In fact, it would be hard to call it cinema. As Kurosawa had once remarked about Ray's Pather Panchali, it is a ""slice of life"". A very big slice at that. Shot over a period of 12 years using the same cast, Linklater has dared to do what no one else ever has, and has created the ultimate epic on childhood and growing up.One must appreciate the risk that was taken to produce this gem. Convincing the cast to stick around for so long, with every possibility that something could go wrong (death, maybe?), convincing the production houses, and many more. But Linklater as a director could easily see beyond all these. And he found the perfect cast who had the same thought process as him, and were privileged to be a part of this epic. Shot mainly during summers, and without any script, Linklater went about capturing (and stitching) life as it is. Unadulterated and non-glamorous.The cast does a magnificent job, with Patricia Arquette stealing the show playing the single mom, very well deserved Oscar. Ethan Hawke is as good as ever. But Ellar Coltrane as Mason possibly deserves the most applauds as he was the untested 6 year old who had to string the movie together for the next 12 years, and does a fantastic job at that. Through him and the rest of the cast, we see the joys and sorrows of childhood and growing up, the pains of separation, moments of love, bullying and abuse, and scores of small incidents which shape our lives. It is the supreme coming of age film. It documents growing up in the early 2000's. It has a wonderful soundtrack, with ""Hero"" by Family of the Year and Coldplay's ""Yellow"" being the extremely memorable ones.Anyone calling this movie boring and uneventful must be reminded that this is no Disney flick. There are no exaggerated moments. And no dramatic outbursts. In fact, that is the whole point of the movie, to keep it as real as possible. It can serve as a reminder as to how challenging and monotonous life can be, and expecting anything else is plain foolishness. Rather, it tells us that that's how life ""should"" be. If your life isn't the same and is filled with fun and glamor, you are the odd one out, and have missed out on some of the most important aspects of living. Life is supposed to be a struggle, there are no two ways to it.The movie surely has its flaws, just like life does, and it all fits together. Which is why I have given it an 8/10. A 10/10 would have ruined the movie."
BOYHOOD,7 November 2014,9/10,"Boyhood Richard Linklater's odyssey to life Are elves for real? Do we really seize the moment or does the moment seize us?! Do our mothers have to love us and hang on to us like a piece of them, or simply be like lions and tigers and rush us out of their safety and protection to save the real world? What is real in this world nowadays your Facebook and cyber accounts or is it simply the actual person that walks the streets unaware of the life around us?12 years in the making summed up in less than 3 hours, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are delightful, but it is the growing up of our little Masson Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) that is most interesting, and while you grow up with a kid who wants to sharpen stones all the way through his teenage years you see life as we live it today you see the life in his eyes, through his sisters eyes, the parents, the friends, the families, the director and most importantly you as a viewer will be cornered into tuning yourself to decide which life to lead. A road film, a drama, a script that plays like a true story, like Perks of Being a Wallflower a few years back, this journey is not only visual and dialogue driven the music in this film is sensational, be it the soundtrack to our lives, from the Beatles to Coldplay and all the way to Arcade Fire or the lyrical renditions the cast goes through, the music choice is impeccable and could easily be used as a compass to guide us through the life line of the filmNot too many words about BOYHOOD in the media today, not too many people are talking about it, yet but this is a film worth visiting it will have you hooked from opening to end it will leave you with a million questions in the back of your head from the moment the film fades out, till the rest of your living days Start sharing the love, cause without love we cease to exist This was a gamble worth making thanks to the choices of Director/Writer Richard Linklater (Creator of the Sun talk trilogy, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, After Midnight) who delivers a Terrence Malick/ Jim Jarmusch film merged into one"
BOYHOOD,13 September 2015,1/10,"The movie is beautifully shot and to see this boy grow old in front of us is incredible yet what is an amazing starting point for a movie project falls short as there's simply no plot to the movie other than this. The story of this boy is extremely conventional, despite the will of the director to bring some drama to it via the complicated relationship between the parents. So in the end it feels like a attempt to appeal on everyones nostalgia, showing memories most of us, white, middle-class people, share and objects from the past we all cared for like a gameboy, etc... I actually couldn't go through the whole movie as I was bored to death and quickly understood that the prowess of seeing this boy grow old on camera was the only interesting fact of the movie."
BOYHOOD,29 March 2016,3/10,"I don't want to disrespect the amount of time and work that went into this movie, but there is really nothing there.It touches every point so superficially that you have a 165 minutes of cliché about boyhood, accompanied by bad (adult) acting. There is no conflict, no story. Dialogues were corny, especially for anyone born in the 90's, who're in the same age group with these kids. Everything in this movie has been said/done in other films till it's worn out. It's not a documentary, not a fiction, hard to understand the point of it all. The only interesting thing about this movie was seeing the actors age/grow up."
BOYHOOD,20 July 2014,10/10,"Where do I start with ""Boyhood?"" The best film of the year. Or years. It's such a tough film to explain, critique or write about. It's tough to even identify exactly what it is about it that I love so much specifically. I guess it's just a crazy package deal called life.This isn't a movie that will be recognized for visual effects or even stunning cinematography for that matter, it's about the story and characters. The acting is just so damn good all around that it's impossible to find a fault, Ethan Hawke's talent just seems effortless, Patricia Arquette is a serious revelation and our newcomer/star Ellar Coltrane is beautifully understated. Perfectly down to earth while throwing us so many strong emotions, it's truly unbelievable. Not to mention Linklater's own daughter who co-stars; she's hilarious, delightful and absolutely essential.All of the other reviews have said it, so I will reiterate it. This is a movie for ANYbody. Anybody who has had a strong friendship, anyone with any kind of family. One particular critic made a comment suggesting that this film could be titled ""Girlhood, Fatherhood, Motherhood, Parenthood"" and it would still have the same effect on you, and it's true. This movie isn't just about boyhood. It's about family, it's about life, it's about the inevitable struggles and hardships that will give way to something meaningful and profound if you play your cards right. In other words, self-discovery plays a huge part in telling the story here, no matter the age. Each character goes through a phase of their own, no matter how old, which is what makes this piece so genuine.Linklater and his production designers do a terrific job of loading you up with nostalgia as the years in this film pass, and it's so authentic. Not only is there an impeccable selection of generational music, but there's subtleties in the actual technology as well. Characters will use old iPod minis, boys will be playing Gameboy Advances and old Xbox's with Halo 2 and they'll wear and talk about the clothing and style of that particular era. You'll recognize these little things immediately and identify with them, and it fuels your viewing experience with joy and youth. And those are just the little things.I'm not going to go through the whole journey and tell you what happens personally through each of Mason Jr's years as the film progresses. I don't want to say anything more. Even though there are some situations that take place that you may not have experience firsthand, it allows you to think freely with a more open mind in the film. It allows you to realize what you have been able to accomplish in life and what still might need work. This movie wants you to know yourself, and it does a damn fine job helping.4/4 stars. It's slowly opening up at more and more theatres over the next 2 weeks. Check your theatre schedules. You don't want to miss this one."
BOYHOOD,31 August 2014,4/10,"Whats all the fuss about? Life inside a family is not terribly absorbing at the best of times. They go to school, share rooms, have annoying siblings .... I could only take an hour of this drivel then walked out. The main actor is weak as the mother shes either unmotivated or manic. The occasional father is predictable and one dimensional but he does have a nice car! We spend way too much time watching paint dry. Dysfunctional families are much too familiar to most of us. Paying good money to watch the predictable is not my idea of time well spent. If, however, you want to see true drama see A Boys Life not this yawn-fest. You should wait for the video version so you can fast forward to the climax."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,10/10,"Time. Time is something I think about pretty much every hour of every day. I'm always looking back on my life and wondering about my future. We all are. People always say that change is the only constant in life, but I disagree. Time is. If there's one thing that always remains, from the moment you are conceived to the moment you die, it's that the clock is going to keep moving forward no matter what. And that what you do with all that time in between birth and death is what life is about. At least I think so. I don't really know. No one does. That's what makes it beautiful, right? Linklater understands this and it's why time plays the biggest factor in just about every film he's ever made.This was a snippet. IMDb wouldn't let me post my entire review because it was too long. So here is a link to read it in full: http://letterboxd.com/eri_/film/boyhood/ I had a lot to say about this masterwork."
BOYHOOD,3 September 2014,4/10,"This is no action packed blockbuster nor an artsy fartsy movie where every camera angle has some deep meaning to it. It's just life. Life from the very beginning and the stages we go through to grow up. We accompany Mason through 12 years of his life, the amount the crew took to film this movie, whats impressive and interesting in it's own rights. Life isn't easy for Mason just like for everyone else. The acting is believable from every character who took place in this movie. The development of the cast is comprehensible, which really helps to immerse in this world because everywhere you can see a part of yourself. It's not a short journey and sure not for everyone, but for those who give it a shot sure worth it."
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,10/10,"I'm very happy that Boyhood was so deservedly rewarded last night at the Golden Globes. I'm not saying it was a perfect film; it did have it's flaws; mainly I was not hugely impressed by Ellar Coltrane's acting (I'd call it a mediocre performance) and the I felt that story line started to wane during ""Mason's"" teenage years, HOWEVER, it was still an extraordinary film and watching it was an amazing, provoking, and new experience. I've truly never seen anything like this, and it moved me. Greatly. Watching Mason actually growing up from a boy to a young man through 12 years, in a pretty unremarkable, typical American setting, and watching Olivia and Mason Sr. learn responsibility and parenting at the same time, made me think about life. REAL life, not life according to Hollywood. Writer/director Richard Linkletter's aim was to make a film that depicts what he thinks real life is all about: ""winging it"" (to quote Ethan Hawke's character in a tender father-son moment towards the end of the film). Or to put it in another way, Linkletter's impression of real life is that we're all just here together doing our best to make things work, in the time that we have. I really felt that so strongly at the end of the film. I also felt very acutely how time passes inevitably and how time is one thing that we humans have no power over.I loved this movie. It deserved the Best Drama and Best Director Golden Globes that were awarded to it last night. I hope this is the first of many successful award nights to come, the Oscars included."
BOYHOOD,8 July 2018,10/10,"This movie is about us, our lives, the lives of our parents and children all in just two and a half hour. It touches you deeply and makes you examine your own life profoundly.
Great movie of life."
BOYHOOD,16 January 2015,1/10,"I don't have a huge amount to say about this film as I feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours.For those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film I have a question. Would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadn't watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? Would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? My personal answer is no. And my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters.I'm not denying the concept is brilliant and original. However, overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of puberty."
BOYHOOD,2 December 2014,4/10,"There were some really beautiful and insightful moments in Boyhood...very brief moments...book ended by hours of mind-numbing nothingness. Unfortunately, overall, it feels like Linklater turned out the equivalent of breaking out some dusty photo albums and showing them to strangers who don't have much in the way of contextual background. The characters generally have no depth and aren't particularly like-able.It was a neat project. I applaud the effort and the idea. It really just doesn't work as far as making a great film. It was OK...or it was better than bad, and the novelty added a bit more spice to the otherwise bland movie. The critics are going to LOVE this movie!I love the idea of the movie. I even love the moments that took me back to relive some of my own childhood. It just felt like it belonged in an extended (and probably very boring) Lifetime Network television series instead of crammed into a movie that was more than just a little disjointed. The movie was basically a collection of acted out memories from youth, with no real direction.I read somewhere (I wish I could quote where) that Linklater really avoided clichés with this movie. He was either lying to the author of the article or himself. His main character, Mason, Jr., ended up becoming the Indie movie darling stereotype...Brooding, disaffected, artist, loner, philosopher...who somehow scored a Photography scholarship to college after giving every indication he might fail out of school due to apathy...poof...movie magic...Ugh.The fact that this is fiction and not a documentary following a real family for 12 years makes it even more frustrating...Where is the story? Where is the character development? Why is this movie set on pushing a liberal political agenda (this was extremely disappointing).As I stated earlier, critics are going to LOVE this for it's novelty. All of your hipster friends are going to wax poetic about it. I will be told I ""just don't get it"". This is one of those movies that are made almost DARING you to not praise it. I am pretty sure you are supposed to watch the film and then pat yourself on the back to congratulate yourself for being so deep and intellectual for truly understanding it."
BOYHOOD,22 October 2014,8/10,"To start this review, I want to address one of the most common complaint I have heard about this film: that is does not have a traditional plot. To this, I will have to refer you to my header. Does your life have a plot? Growing up, did you have one goal in mind, with perhaps a romantic subplot? Of course you didn't. And this is not simply a film about a boy growing up; this IS a boy growing up.I do not think that there has been a character in the history of film that I have identified with more than Mason. From the first shot of him contemplating the small things of life, to him watching Dragonball Z, he and I may have lived each other's lives. We even had the same bed sheets! However, don't take that as me comparing my life to this character. I firmly believe that at least 75% of boys the age of Mason at the end of the film could identify with him. This film is shot beautifully and, to be honest, did not even seem like it took nearly three hours. I was entrapped by it from the very beginning. Yes, there is no real plot. The joy of the movie is seeing the lives of these people progress, in ways that you can relate to. I highly recommend this film to any and everyone, but specifically males around the age of 18, perhaps a bit older too. This film with make you so nostalgic it hurts, but luckily that isn't its only good point."
BOYHOOD,19 June 2015,9/10,"This film consoles you. It magnificently distills the journey of a young lad through his childhood. I found this film completely engaging and I think that was mainly due to how human the characters felt. The beauty of this film I think is really in its simplicity, especially having grown up myself around events depicted in the film, you can completely relate to the things that are going on around the characters. You completely feel that Linklater isn't trying to force the storyline anywhere it doesn't have to go, he's just letting it take its natural course. Also I loved the way you see the main character transform from the camera shy period of his adolescent to the more mature college student. I just didn't want this film to end, I felt so wrapped up in the lives of these characters."
BOYHOOD,12 December 2014,10/10,"Recently, I had one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life. I delved into Richard Linklater's wonderfully organic and profoundly moving masterpiece, Boyhood. For those of you unfamiliar with the film, Boyhood chronicles the life of Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane) as he wades through childhood from ages seven to eighteen. Sounds like the plot to a movie we've seen a few thousand times, right? Wrong. Boyhood shatters all Hollywood norms with groundbreaking style, story, and originality. It's unlike anything you've seen before.For starters, Linklater actually shot the movie over twelve years, following his actors as they age both in their roles and in real life. Since 2002, the cast of Boyhood gathered for a few weeks each summer to film the next chapter of Mason's life. It's mindboggling watching Coltrane literally mature on screen in a compression of his life since 2002. Because of this, the film doesn't feel like a movie at all, but more like an epic poem or a series of subtle moments that collectively define what it means to be a boy in the 21st century. This unique directorial style transcends our expectations of what a movie ""should"" be and allows Linklater to explore the nuances of his characters like an author would in a great work of literature.Young Mason lives a largely unassuming and ordinary life. He doesn't battle with cancer, make a monumental mistake in his love life, or fall into a dangerous cycle of drug and alcohol abuse. Unlike all Hollywood films about childhood—filled with fictionalized plots that attempt to tear your emotions apart—Boyhood remains grounded in reality. Mason's story isn't meant to make you overly sentimental; he goes to school, moves houses, splits time between his divorced parents. All of it seems trivial on the surface. Linklater could have easily slipped into a melodramatic Hollywood trap of depicting a rebellious boy who feels alone with his tribulations in a world that seems too rigid to satisfy his needs. But Linklater holds true to a vision of ordinary life. And within that ordinary life, Linklater collects moments of ordinary beauty.In one scene, a high school senior offers Mason his first beer in eighth grade. Moments later Mason and his friends start throwing a circular saw at a wooden board for some exciting fun. The whole time, you're waiting for something scary to happen—for someone to lose a finger, for one of the seniors to pressure him into doing drugs, or for the police to show up. Yet nothing quite so sensational happens, because Linklater isn't trying to entertain us. He's simply showing us a scene of modern childhood. Mason has his first illegal drink; his friends test their fate by doing something dangerous and stupid. Moments like these elevate Boyhood to a state beyond pure entertainment, and the film ventures into new, uncharted cinematic territory. It's the first movie that has ever felt like a true memoir, documenting all those little snippets of life that influenced us in delicate ways growing up, even if we can't pinpoint one defining, epiphanic moment. But it's not until after the final scene, until after you sit in front of the black screen for minutes that you come to an earth- shattering realization—you just watched a movie about you. Boyhood's final scene shows Mason's first day at college, as he reflects on his childhood, and attempts to figure out what it all means—life, living, people. And that's when we're shell-shocked, because we are Mason. We lived his childhood, thought his thoughts, dealt with his changes, laughed his laughs, cried his sorrows. It's that impalpable quality which gives Linklater's film power. The movie screen becomes a mirror, sums up all the emotions of nostalgia, pain, and happiness we've ever felt in life, and lays them back into our hands. The feeling is nothing short of spectacular."
BOYHOOD,22 January 2015,1/10,"I have just wasted nearly 3 hours of valuable movie time just to see what all the fuzz is aboutWhoever finds this movie ""special"" because it took a bit of time to film it: get a life and don't try to be arty.Just for the record: if I could have given this movie less than one star I definitely would haveI was seriously bothered by the attitude and the uselessness of these kids and the way they try to be all knowing and ""different"". Grow up, get a job and make a difference.No entertainment value. Definitely not a classic in the making. Have some pain killers ready. If you need to watch the whole thing, have some red bull nearby. Please rate this thing for what it is worth: 1 star"
BOYHOOD,13 September 2014,2/10,"Great idea. Poorly executed. Screenplay dominated by factual biography. Minimal external, contextual references. Few glimpses on internal struggles, doubts, nuances of choice. No cinematography. This could have been a good reality show. Belongs there. No reason for 2.4 hours. There is no substance outside the historical sequence of events. Ver similar transitions to Slacker and Waking Life: main character posses a pervasive equidistant, phlegmatic stance. Hard to digest some of the clichés when describing political preferences, social classes. Some moments of embarrassment also when characters seem replicas of tabloids."
BOYHOOD,16 July 2015,10/10,"By reading the previous review and current rating of the movie, it is easy to understand some people are disappointed while some are amazed. Because this movie is so unexpected that nothing happens that could be expected where as nothing happens except life.If you're a parent and around or over 40, I think you will love and understand this movie much easier. I wasn't expecting much but it turned out one of the best movie I have ever watched in recently.Some of you will hate, disappoint. Some of you will never understand what others hated, because it is so good.Dialog in the movie is something that you do in your daily life, nothing is unusual. But this movie put them in a sequence which you see your own boyhood and can't keep yourself judging your own life, you own parents and own relation with them.You like or you hate, it definitely worth spending 3 hours."
BOYHOOD,27 January 2015,1/10,"Oscars coming up next month - which nominee do I wish to see??? After much debate with my wife and friends we decide on ""Boyhood"".(FLASHBACK 11 YEARS:) Oscars coming up next month - which nominee do I wish to see??? After much debate with my wife and friends we decide on ""Lost In Translation"".(BACK TO PRESENT:) I'm sitting here recalling the two worst movie decisions of my life. Craziest thing would be if Boyhood actually wins Best Picture (ha!). As we all watched, our backsides getting numb, we occasionally exchanged puzzled looks at each other as if to say ""what the heck is going on here?"" The movie, much like its 11 year old predecessor, made all of us ask how could we all be so different from the critics that raved about this movie.Its only claim to fame appears to be that it took so many years to film it. Duh. We have things nowadays in Hollywood called ""make up"" and multiple actors that pull off time changes with no problem - just look at Benjamin Button! I've seen better hidden camera performances than this ""scripted"" documentary displayed. I would believe that the director didn't have to say ""action"", he'd just say ""act normally"".Mason and Nicole have a great little chuckle at the end of the movie.They know what they just pulled off. What a waste of time, 35mm, and money."
BOYHOOD,12 December 2014,10/10,"Growing up is a memorable time for everyone when we look back at old photos or old videos of ourselves having a great time and all the wonderful moments. Boyhood conveys this to us realistically though 12 years. Richard Linklater wanted the audience to feel apart of the journey all over again and spared no rush to showcase this to the audience. It is difficult to wait 12 years to make a movie but the reaction pays it off.Speaking from my perspective, I grew up around the same time and felt almost as if I was reliving the experience. Even though it hasn't been long since my childhood, this movie brought tears to my eyes from the start to the end. I felt that Richard Linklater's sole purpose was to connect with his audience and bring back happiness into our long lost childhood lives and it felt real. Overall, Richard delivers one of the most touching, realistic, naturalistic, and sentimental works of art in todays society. A perfect masterpiece ten out of ten."
BOYHOOD,1 November 2014,10/10,"hey all, All you guys are saying that movie shouldn't have huge rating because its not so good as it got rated..so for those people who think that they are looser .They just cant see reality and don't wanna face it. The beauty of movie is""who plays the boy of the title, was 7 years old when the movie started filming and 18 when it finished"" as well as all crew included so its mean it had been 12 years to make a movie and the director have to wait for it but unfortunately he died.but movie still accomplished by others..this best shot i can give you this movie is awesome very natural and heart touching movie for people who have wisdom on upper portion"
BOYHOOD,9 March 2015,5/10,"Disappointing. What's all the fuss about? The film is boring, inconsequential and way overlong. It's supposed to be a drama right? It's not a documentary so why does it feel like one? For goodness sake Linklater, at least write some drama or comedy or tragedy or something. The film just feels like real life. And how exciting is that! There are no 'moments' in this film at all. Mason is just not very interesting. What he does is not very interesting. Nothing happens to him. So it was filmed over 12 years. Whoop De Doo! Where's the catharsis?I liked the soundtrack though."
BOYHOOD,14 March 2015,9/10,I must say I was blown away by how deep this movie actually is!It is life in its utmost complexity while at the same time it all travels in such a simple way!It is really an intricate masterpiece if you watch it like you should (without any expectations is how I watch every movie). It's a movie that you really need to watch and not just watch whit your eyes but with your mind as well. It makes you think about your life and about every single decision you made in your life! It is wonderful watching them all grow and mature and take different paths in their life! Some people say it is boring! Yeah it is boring if you don't put your heart and soul into watching the movie the same way the director put his skills and energy into making it! You know it grinds my gears when people say about a movie that it is not realistic and then they are given a realistic movie and they complain about how boring it is! Well guess what?? You are boring! Life is not like in the movies. But this one is the most realistic movie about the circle of life that I watched! And what the hell did you expect!? It is life at it's realest (not a word I know but it just fits right in here). Just because it is so simple(read- complex inside-out)(read- boring to some people) it is fascinating and beautiful. Peace out peeps.
BOYHOOD,30 October 2014,10/10,"This movie is long, there is no action, and no great moment that you would remember. Yet this movie is perfect in so many ways. While some characters in the movie appear as lame or irresponsible like the kids dad at the end I just realized this is how life is. Everyone is just doing the best they could at a particular moment of their life. This is a great experiment but does not feel like one. It feels more like being there somewhere in the lives of these people. As the movie progresses you will stay focused on the characters, concerned about their future as their life unfolds feeling like a friend or a elder relative to these kids."
BOYHOOD,26 January 2017,8/10,"Boyhood is a coming-of-age drama film that goes to the length of shooting for over 12 years to achieve what the director, Richard Linklater wants to offer the audience. A tale of a 6-year old boy and his sister's life, as they grow up living door-to-door with their single mother who has been making the worst life decisions when it comes to choosing the kids' father. The real father(played by Ethan Hawke) is on good terms though, as they go with him every other weekend. The story grows along them as they reach adolescence and the changes they have, which is depicted in a very natural way, given the actors have stayed the some over the course of time.The film is surely one of its kind"
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,9/10,"I feel this film is very much a ""love-it-or-hate-it"" kind of film, with its very long running time and fairly unremarkable plot I find it very easy to see how others may find it boring and dislike it, but I most certainly did not. I think the unremarkable nature of the plot is exactly what makes it remarkable, its intense realism throughout the film puts a mirror up to the true nature of life. Life is not like the movies, and for most of us life is as unremarkable as the plot of Boyhood. And so you end the film, after nearly three hours of watching it, having literally witnessed the life of a young boy as he grows up and there's something quite remarkable about seeing that. The feeling you get after watching the film is totally indescribable, it's like your eyes have been opened to the world for the first time! Coupled with a soundtrack that really shows the subtle changes of popular culture over the time period and excellent performances, particularly from Patricia Arquette, this film is one that will truly stand the test of time."
BOYHOOD,16 July 2014,10/10,"At the end of this year, I plan to study Film at University and so I think it is appropriate that I begin writing reviews for films (as I did not do Film Studies at A-Level. This is my first film review). Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood' reinforces the reason as to why I would like to study Film. Going into Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood', I knew only a minority of things (none being about the film itself). Firstly, that 'Boyhood' was rated 9/10 on IMDb. IMDb (most of the time) speaks the truth about films, it formulates a consensus from people like you and I. Therefore, I expected 'Boyhood' to be a good film, yet of course I did have a natural feeling of doubt that 'Boyhood' would not be good. Secondly, that I have previously seen Richard Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' (1995), 'Before Sunset' (2004) and 'Before Midnight' (2013), thus knowing this trilogy was great - my expectations increased for 'Boyhood'. Truth. Truth about life, about reality, about you, me - everyone. This is what Linklater depicts so superbly in 'Boyhood'. This film is phenomenal. 'Boyhood' will be studied in the years to come, and the years following. After 'Boyhood' had finish I over heard people discussing the film, they voiced the critical opinion that the way the character's change, in terms of appearance, was forced. In response to this; yes it was obvious blah blah blah but that is the beauty of 'Boyhood'. Aging and growing up comes with change. Change is the motif of this film. Whether it's through the characters body, voice or hair. Linklater presents change in such a way that it makes you - and the audience - think of how it was to grow, change, learn, make friends, have a girlfriend, break-up, marry, divorce, make mistakes, and subsequently learn from them.'Boyhood' is more than a story, it is a journey, through life's up's and down's. Linklater subtlety inspires the audience to seize the day or 'carpe diem' by thinking of the opposite, and whether it's extreme of me to claim, f**k it! This is and will be Linklater's Magnum Opus or at the very least the pinnacle of his, already successful, career in film. Lastly, the directing, writing and acting is hard to sum up in words. It's hard to believe when you perceive it on the big screen. Watch 'Boyhood', is all I can say - you will not be disappointed, trust me."
BOYHOOD,25 February 2015,10/10,"As per my interpretation: a set of moments that are imprinted in Mason's memory. I have my own. These are not tied necessarily to the most important or grander events of one's life but for some random reason are the most vivid recollections. This might not have been the authors intention, it is nevertheless how I see it.Even if Mason's life experiences are nothing like mine I felt an extreme connection to the character due to the parallel process of remembrance.I want to sincerely thank whoever had the idea for this story and whoever decided to dedicate resources to make it happen.What an extremely pleasurable experience!"
BOYHOOD,20 January 2015,10/10,"Boyhood is not a movie, it is a portrait of life itself. If you want to see a movie - with an introduction, climax and resolution - this is not the one for you. But in case you are the type of person who enjoys looking out of your window and watching your neighbors living their normal lives; if you enjoy seeing the time passing by and its effects on everyone around you, this is going to be one of the best experiences of your life. Boyhood's making is in itself enough reason to call it groundbreaking and unmissable, but underneath the story of Mason and his family there is still another one: our own story. It is impossible not to see our life in flashback and relive our milestones with Mason. This movie is an excellent reason for us to think back and see the roots of what we are now in our childhood and teenage years. As we already expect - due to Richard Linklater's characteristics as a film director – Boyhood doesn't tell a story, it IS a story. We don't see the characters just jumping from action to action, we see them actually living their lives, having dialogues as real and natural as the ones we have in our daily lives.Watching this film was one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had. It is unforgettable in its delicacy and originality. My advice: go watch it today and let yourself be ""seized by the moment""."
BOYHOOD,20 October 2015,7/10,"I really do wish I could give a score of eight or even nine. Because the continual build-up and captivating quality of this film is quite impressive, as well as the numerous themes that touch humanity's heart. With that said, let me shed a tear: God is missing. All he had to do was open the Good Book (which was a solid moment in this movie, by the way.) But the blasphemous words and hopeless afterlife dropped the score. The part of humankind's heart that I mentioned is clearly shown in how the young and old characters are all happy to go bankrupt in opening the one treasure chest that will hopefully satisfy their inner chest's deep longing. So simple, yet it is proved here how man is no better than a lamb with no shepherd. Quite very sad. Purpose in your life? Israel's Messiah. The crucified One is thee true love. To be had."
BOYHOOD,20 May 2018,6/10,"Full disclosure: I'm writing this after skimming through other reviews. And I was struck by how many 1 and 10 ratings people gave this movie. No many middle number ratings given. But maybe the best art tends to be that way?Personally, I found it hard to watch due to the slow pace, the banal acting (except for Ethan Hawke, but of course his personality was in the script) and the ordinary cinematography. Not one character really drew me in or made me care that much about how things would work out for them.The ending scene when he finally arrives at college and finally finds life making some sense to him is good, but then you remember he was high at that moment, so was he truly fulfilled?Some serious editing needs to happen to get this from 2 hours, 45 minutes to maybe 1:45."
BOYHOOD,6 December 2014,,"Boyhood is an extraordinary achievement and there's no doubt it's a landmark in film history. It's cinematically very simple yet as an evocation of growing up, family life and human relationships it is deeply truthful, emotive and nostalgic- it makes you reflect on your own childhood and life in general like no other film I've ever seen. In fact, the unpretentiousness of it heightens the feeling that this film understands that it is dealing with themes that are so universal yet every day that any fancy stylistic flourishes would be unnecessary. Richard Linklater's approach is totally organic-seeming and refreshingly simple- he knows he needs to let the characters and the plot speak for themselves. That being said, one recurring motif that's effectively utilised is the camera lingering on Ellar Coltrane's face while his character contemplates his current situation, emphasising how a key theme of the film is exploring the world through the eyes of a child. The dialogue is, despite occasional strains for profundity, generally naturalistic and honest. The story is, by necessity, epic yet intimate (you can probably tell it's a film of contrasts by now) and wholly involving- you are never bored by what's going on despite it not being earth-shattering events. The tone is perfectly managed- changes in it never seem jarring, they merely reflect the nature of life. The ending doesn't completely work (being one of those aforementioned overreaching moment) but it doesn't spoil the film. The characters are, perhaps predictably, thoroughly well-developed (especially Coltrane's of course) and lived in feeling.The performances are uniformly good. Lorelei Linklater's acting starts off pretty badly but she grows into the role of the younger sister. Coltrane, Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke show a thorough commitment to their roles and watching them mature while still retaining their character is impressive. The film is a staggering achievement in editing- there are no fancy techniques but it is still used to powerful effect a number of times (basically at any time skip). It also doesn't seem too long, in spite of it's great length- if anything, you want to see more of the character's lives. Probably the thing that I found most affecting about the film was its attention to detail- there are many moments, littered throughout the film, that, despite being small touches, carry an emotional power that really sticks in the mind. It also has a great soundtrack too! When it finished, I knew I would want to watch it again to analyse it again- it is rich and immersive, an experience that I can honestly say is utterly unique. The film and its characters stick in your mind long after the closing moments and you can't help but reflect on the quiet beauty and intelligence of this near-masterpiece.My Rating: 9.4"
BOYHOOD,21 January 2020,8/10,"Not many films can do this, but this did. It kept me watching although nothing major seems to happen. I put this down to Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette's acting. Hawke was entertaining, funny, real and overall convincing as his part.I do feel more could have been done to create drama BUT this is not an action film, not a horror, or thriller. I am assuming it's meant to take us through the journey of a boy growing in to a young man - and sometimes life isn't full of action and thrills, explosions and huge drama. I appreciated that they tried to make this as real as they could.Of course, there were parts with some drama though like the abusive step father and the control freak ex military step father.Overall I enjoyed the movie, did not feel like it dragged at all."
BOYHOOD,20 January 2016,6/10,"I found this movie really interesting, because of how it was filmed, but after the first i couldn't oversee the fact, that the guy can't play the role authentic. I don't mind how cool and exciting it is to see this guy(family) grow up, I personally enjoy a good movie with good actors way more, than average movie, with not so good actors and a cool filming gimmick. I think this was a wasted opportunity, because the this is clearly something never made before, but it was always a risk, cause people can develop very differently over the time of 12 years. I have read many reviews of this film and it seems to be the same problem with the revenant now. Every one knows how awesome it should be, but no one is quite brave enough to say that something wasn't good in those movies.Lets see if we will get a similar film in the future."
BOYHOOD,29 July 2015,1/10,"After almost 3 hours I can only say that it was a waste of time. The characters are COMPLETELY sad, in the context of doing nothing... really nothing interesting.Is depressing to see so many boring characters and a boring story for such a long time!The only thing that brings a bit on interest to this sea of annoying sadness is his dads, both of them. Sometimes I just wanted to scream ""mooove! Do something for you! Say something goddamn!"". Beside the not interesting (at all) history and characters, the kids are annoying!I'm not an expert in cinema criticism and my English is bad, but I saw a lot of good movies and I know this is not one of them, not even close. Maybe the movie making was good, but that's all.As I said, there is NOTHING in this movie! See it if you have nothing to do, really nothing. Otherwise you may wish to have that 3 hours back.This movie is more ""pain in the ass"" than Brokeback Mountain :D"
BOYHOOD,29 December 2014,10/10,"""Boyhood"" is probably the best of all the film releases this year. What is absolutely incredible about it and unique in all of cinematography's history is the long amount of time throughout which it was filmed – 12 years! Because of this, I could witness the same type of evolution of its characters as that of those in ""Two and a Half Men"" or ""Dexter"", but in such a compressed and well-set production unlike any other. The film captures the physical and intellectual evolution of its characters (played by the same actors during all the stages of their lives), as the director and screenwriter Richard Linklater skillfully manages to highlight a series of life lessons. The story begins in 2002 with Patricia Arquette as a single mother with two children. Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) is the typical indolent and quite stubborn teenager who, eventually, when shown some understanding, changes her ways. Her younger brother, Mason (Ellar Coltrane), is an introvert child. He doesn't speak to anyone, rarely makes so much as a gesture and often has serious socializing issues, as he isn't capable of putting his words into thoughts when most needed. This character's mystery also comes from the fact that the film lacks a narrator, which leaves the audience no choice but to guess what Mason is really thinking. The entire story takes place in Texas and, because of the mother's attempts to make her children's lives better by often changing her job, the family has to change its home several times. However, the movie presents more than just its characters' lives. It also shows us how much society and the young generation's way of reporting to it get affected by the ever-changing technology (Apple's ascension) or by the music industry (Lady Gaga's ascension). The mother has the children's custody, but once every two weeks, their father, Mason Senior (Ethan Hawke) spends some time with the two. This aspect is the most highlighted one in the movie. The father represents the typical parent who, because of being separated from his children, does all he can in order to recover all the times he's lost (even though this means trying to make big steps on a weekly basis). The film also presents the two parents' attempts to rebuild their lives; on one side lays the mother, as she tries to keep her family together, while on the other side lays the father, as he tries to form himself a new one. Things become complicated when, in the mother's life show up a series of lovers who turn out to be absolutely inappropriate, marking Mason's life forever. Despite all this, he doesn't let these negative experiences stop him from following his inclination towards art and, as the years pass, you will witness many moments in Mason's life in which you will find yourself. This film represents a fresco of the beginning of the 21st century society, and although there are many more things to be touched upon when it comes to this complex production, I will leave them for you to discover. Every one of the 165 minutes you spend watching it is worth it. Enjoy!"
BOYHOOD,9 February 2015,7/10,"First I didn't feel like watching the movie. Next I didn't feel like finishing it. then I was reluctantly said 'okay,I guess'. But now as 'time' is passing by,the movie is sinking in,and it's good you know! nothing flashy,not a rich plot,nothing...but I have to say,this movie has got a life in it,no matter how boring that is,that matters!You'll know what I'm talking about! so,just sit up straight (you gotta,it's 165 minutes of 'nothing') and enjoy(or,watch..whatever!) But gotta hand some credit to the director,he did a really good and unique job and when I started watching it,I didn't expect something as aesthetic as it is. The music was good too throughout the end! yeah,I'm done!"
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,3/10,"I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10 simply because the idea of filming the protagonist over a 12 year-period is quite interesting. But, unfortunately, the great and innovative idea had an incredibly poor execution.First of all, you will not feel connected to any of the characters (perhaps with the biological dad, he did a good job, but that's it), in fact, you'll want a huge boulder to fall in each one of them. The protagonist, at his teen years, is simply dull and boring. The mom keeps repeating the same mistakes over and over again, which gets really repetitive at a point.I watched this movie due to the hype and over-the-sky reviews it got. I was really disappointed when it ended. This movie had the potential to be a classic. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this movie, you will not miss out on anything, trust me."
BOYHOOD,2 January 2019,10/10,"The fact that Richard Linklater took 12 years to film this masterpiece is just incredible. So much time and devotion and it definitely shows. Sure, it's a long movie, but it needs to be. You literally get to watch a boy grow up and go to college. All the characters age in real life. They didn't feel like characters in a movie. It felt like you were watching some moments of your friends life. All the performances are perfect. Yes there are some cheesy lines, but it's supposed to be that way. When you're a teenager you stay a lot of cheesy, cringey things. It makes the movie feel so real. Best movie of the decade"
BOYHOOD,15 February 2015,7/10,"I love taking a glimpse of other people's life, and see how much different or alike they are to me. That's why, even though the movie goes at a very slow pace, has no actual ""plot"", and is extremely long, I liked it. It has great potential, but it's just not the most commercial kind of movie. You don't generally go to the cinema to see this movie with your friends, it's more for the times when you're alone at home, wondering about your life, contemplating destiny, submerged in existential melancholy. And I consider these movies to be the best kind, not because they're the most artistic, beautiful or exciting, but because they make us think about things that actually matter (it doesn't even have to be at large scale, it can be about pretty domestic and common things that affect us little by little).I loved the fact that all the characters are real human beings (except for the woman's second husband, that guy was simply there to be the bad drunk guy that inspires some sense of danger to the story). I could literally see two of my real life friends merged into the sister, and similar things happened with every character with a developed background. I also loved that, even though Mason and Sam went through a lot of rough family issues (divorced parents, drunk step dads, constantly moving and changing schools), they got through all that without much drama shown to us. They seemed like strong people, like their mother and their father did a good job at raising them, even after the divorce. The character I liked the most was the father: he is introduced to us as an irresponsible dad, like a kid that never matured, but he is capable of loving and caring for his kids, just not on the conventional way the mother wanted. Actually, he is the one who gives all the important talks: the condoms talk, the inspiring post- graduation talk, the magic talk, etc. At the end, he is the one that made the most impact on the kids, and the one with the most satisfying life. The mother, on the other side, is shown to be the responsible parent, but all through the movie she proves to be a frustrated person, never getting what she wanted out of life. She raised and protected her children, finished college, worked as a teacher (a good one), sent her kids to college, but she is never seen communicating. She's always barking at the children, complaining about her life and being stressed out. And at the end, she is alone at her tiny new apartment, without her kids, without a partner (lets not talk about her terrible skills at choosing partners), angry at discovering there wasn't another phase in life she could struggle her way through. And the only person she really influenced positively, the Latino guy that decided to study when she told him he was smart, she didn't even recognize (as would be expected). I concentrate on this two characters because during most of the movie, they seemed to be the protagonists instead of the kids. Is there an important lesson to the story? An inspiring message for the masses? Not directly. There's nothing in this movie that you probably haven't seen in real life. But it makes you think about these characters, their decisions, the twists. According to the social construct of adulthood, the father should have ended up as a loser due to his irresponsibility, while the mother should have had a wonderful and satisfactory life because she was responsible. But this was not the case. Maybe the lesson in this is that behaving on a certain way wont necessarily guarantee you an specific kind of life. Maybe people are made of a great variety of things, and the events of a certain moment in time don't define you or your destiny. But these are just my speculations. Maybe the movie doesn't need a message: it could just be about telling a story the way it was. No better and no less."
BOYHOOD,22 June 2014,9/10,"This is one of the films that made me think. In its three hours, not a single minute is boring. These lives are drawn so authentically, that it seems like you experienced another boyhood when you leave the cinema. A stunning experience, which makes memories alive again. Its a very smart film. Sensitive and thoughtful. Every dialogue is intelligent and moves the story forward, or gives us a different point of view. In the film is place for suffer and joy. Just all the roller-coaster-drive you do when you get older. Its funny, sweet and has great cinematography in it. All in all, one of the best films I ever saw: Oscar BUZZ!"
BOYHOOD,27 February 2015,8/10,"Expressed by some as a 'gimmick' the famous 12 year filming process of Boyhood was a deliberate choice by director Richard Linklater to have us watch the characters grow, for real; and it works. In fact it's very easy to just forget about the production history of the film because it is captivating to see both the physical and mental transformation of the talented actors and actresses on show here. It's a long movie, spanning a broad amount of themes, so being able to care for these characters should be essential as part of the viewing experience and it is, thanks to a great script and wonderfully realised and maturing performances from everyone involved. The film is a refined take on the classic 'coming of age' story and as such it can sometimes feel like a movie you've seen before; despite being meticulously crafted. The 'teen problems' and self discovery issues feel quite 'samey' as part of what is supposed to be a grand project. It's tough though, because this is a well written script and the characters are well realised - its just that a sense of deja vu hangs over the overarching themes and plot points of the movie *see drunken and abusive step-dad for example. There is extensive discussions to be had around Boyhood, but to cut to the chase of my opinion, I feel Linklater has created the definitive coming of age story, at the cost of repeating messages we've seen in movies prior to this one. The unspoken (or literally spoken) hero of the film, however, is the script that places the thematic importance on everyone, not just the boy. A film equally about motherhood, fatherhood and even sisterhood - Boyhood - covers life."
BOYHOOD,1 September 2014,9/10,"The idea of filming with the same actors all over those years was nuts, but totally paid up, the characters are completely authentic, the movie y really good but a bit slow, i think it misses something but the objective was completed they showed the life of a boy while growing in a real family environment. The way the characters interact is great i supposed is because of the fact of actually growing with each other all the years of filming, really brought them together not only as a crew but as friends and family , for me thats the secret of this movie , even though this hasn't the best script ever the actors make the movie this good, the truth of their personality."
BOYHOOD,17 June 2014,8/10,"There is no denying that this is an extraordinary achievement in that 4 characters literally age before our eyes over a 12 year period. But I keep asking myself if I was swayed by that more than the quality of the film itself. The dialog and interactions are very genuine and believable, there are very compelling performances and there is one scene in particular where Patricia Arquette just broke my heart. When I told folks that I had seen it I had a really hard time describing it to them! It is a Linklater film so it is dialog heavy as opposed to action driven. I suppose the mark of a great film is that 3 days after seeing it, I am still thinking about it and want to see it again."
BOYHOOD,22 September 2014,10/10,"Boyhood is unique. I have never seen such a simple story touch my heart in such an elegant and natural way. The ""quoditianess"" of the scene and the plot makes it look like a costumbrist and realistic approach for the life of Mason, a young boy who turns into an adult throughout the emotional, friendship and familiar up and downs of his life on which we are pretty empathize.As I said Boyhood got me. There are many aspects to criticise perhaps, many of them technical, such as lighting, shot compositions and camera movements, but at the same time it gives the move an informal, less artificial and closer-to-reality look to the medium class viewers' lifes."
BOYHOOD,28 March 2017,10/10,"Boyhood is how much more true it is seen in American cinema of the last decade. Identify with Mason is simple, especially if you were born in the late 90s, but the story is so well written, the basic idea is so original that it captures all generations. Linklater is brilliant, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are perfect parents, the part of Ellar Coltrane is so lukewarm recited to make it more realistic, Boyhood is the definitive introspective journey of the life."
BOYHOOD,10 November 2016,1/10,"This is a very slow pace movie, the idea that it is made through several years allows you to see the characters as they grow up and might make you connect emotionally with the characters. However, at the end I felt more like watching a documentary of a real American family than a Movie. I waited for ""A"" story, but I felt there wasn't any major stories but small unconnected stories here and there.I really felt bored watching it, and hopped for a story to develop in the first part of the movie, but then I lost hope as time elapsed and a story never developed.Although, I felt bored and didn't enjoy the story line, the actors did a really good job and as I mentioned I felt this is a documentary about a real family."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2014,1/10,"A movie should not be marketed as a generic movie about a boy growing up and then slowly turn into an alcoholic psychodrama. After 1 hour, you're faced with a wife beating, child hazing stepfather and an excellent example of why women should not remarry if they have kids. Sickening downer with false advertising. I walked out after about an hour, in the scene where the step father brings an alcohol bottle to the dinner table and asks everyone whether they ""have a problem with that."" The scene closely followed two others. One where he obviously beat his wife until she was lying on the floor crying, and continued to yell at her and the kids. And another where he psychotically forces his stepson to get a crew cut without even asking him, just because he can. If this is your idea of fun, please go see the movie. I complained to the theater manager and got my money back."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2014,1/10,"The idea of the film is great, they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored, however I feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together. Forgive me if I've missed anything, but I feel that I spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude, ill-mannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life. I spent the entire film looking for the ""beauty"" or ""the message"" in this ""masterpiece"" and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up, nothing bloody happened.My definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something, which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration, something which makes you think about an interesting topic. I was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake Hollywood crap. Also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending, or some sort of redeeming quality, like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasn't genuinely being considered great (IMDB rating 9.0?!, maybe that's a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in Hollywood is laughing at us.)Unfortunately the minimum rating is 1/10 whereas I believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate. In ancient Rome they had no concept of negative numbers, I feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0. Don't see this film please, and for goodness sake don't let it win any Oscars, I don't want the industry to be polluted with films like this."
BOYHOOD,14 August 2014,10/10,"This movie was able to capture a moment in time and preserve it for as long as digital media will be accessible (and possibly longer). Having grown up near this time frame and being around 20-23 now, I can say that the movie took a very precise look at the time and hit it perfectly. The style of filming that the film underwent has already made its place in the history books, but the detail and ability to capture the actual human life (more than just the boy, the other characters that were developed are just as important) was truly spectacular. Life is wonderful, hurtful, scary, and ever-changing and this film has captured all of this in the best possible way. Groundbreaking"
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,2/10,"This was the most boring movie I have watched for some time. I even registered with IMDb just to say ""I want my 3 hrs back"". I can appreciate the time it took to make, and the places it was shot but that's it, nothing happens. Honestly after the first 15 Min's I was saying, something will happen soon. After 2.5 hrs I was just watching out of spite to see if something would happen at the end. NO, nothing.. I think that the main actor lacks substance too, it was as if he almost wanted to be there but not quite. I was waiting for him to loose his temper and do something, anything. But again nothing, he just kept plodding along and mumbling away. I personally think that during the 12 years someone lost the script."
BOYHOOD,23 November 2014,6/10,"This is definitely a unique film, its definitely not the most entertaining but i'd be lying if i told you that this movie didn't hook me in. In a way, watching this movie is sort of like opening up a photo album and seeing pictures from your childhood. A lot of people will be able to relate to this film, and you'll definitely find yourself saying ""I remember when this happened to me"". I also feel like the more parallels you're able to draw with your own childhood and Mason's in this film, the more meaning this movie will have for you, which for me explains why a lot of people have this movie rated as high as a 10/10. Though in my opinion, there is not much else that stands out in this film if you were to take away its nostalgic factor and the 12-year span of filming concept. I mean, yes the dialog in the movie was great and it is an ideal way to understand the characters in this movie more. I just felt that the dialog just came off as ""unrealistic"" and at times cliché. These unrealistic dialog worked perfectly in his Before ___ trilogy, but not so much in this movie because in my opinion it just takes away from the realism of this film. Also none of the characters in this movie really stood out to me even the main character, Mason, but at the same time each character has their purpose in the film and were essential to Mason's growth. As far as the story goes, there really isn't much of a story. This movie is pretty straightforward, don't expect a roller coaster ride or lifetime drama when watching this. The pace of the film is pretty steady, though the movie the feel shorter then it's near 3 hour runtime.Overall, i can see why some give this film the praise that it receives, but for me personally this film was just an interesting experience to say the least. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, and i don't see myself watching it again, anytime soon. I do think most people should watch this film, but i wouldn't rush them to see it."
BOYHOOD,28 June 2017,5/10,"i really wanted to know what was all this fuss about and when i saw it got 8 on IMDb, i thought i should give it a try and yeah i wasted 3 hours of my life. in the beginning i thought OK it'll get better but it didn't and it was horrible. seriously it was like watching a documentary. :/"
BOYHOOD,17 April 2015,7/10,"""Boyhood"" is a special movie in terms of directing idea plus inspiration thing of 12 years old work. Beyond that, though, if someone would going to declare it as a movie at all, wouldn't say that it has something that special in conjunction with others similar films. The plot has been limited by the director's idea and doesn't go further than that. I can totally distinguish the monotony of the film, because in the life of the protagonist, nothing bad happen's expect of 2-3 failed marriages of his mam. Nothing more. I can give point to the film about collateral reports to facebook and ""teenagers problems"" generally, but even that could be more realistic making the problems of protagonist more interesting or serious (something that would totally fit to the personality of this individual protagonist)."
BOYHOOD,27 November 2014,2/10,"The only thing interesting about this movie is the fact that there was a serious commitment in peoples time to film it over 12 years. I did enjoy watching the main characters develop/grow over 12 years but the movie as whole was boring and uneventful. The story didn't impart any profound life lessons or anything else that could be gained from my investment of three hours in front of a television. I kept waiting for some big climax in the story to take place to redeem the whole thing but it never happened. I'm not real sure why this movie has such high ratings. Makes me wonder about the views who think this was actually a good piece of work. Seriously, save your time and watch something else. This movie was boring at best..."
BOYHOOD,8 November 2014,1/10,"This movie is not even close of what I was expecting it to be. Nothing really happens in the whole movie. I mean come on is this even real life ? Everything was so quiet and simple. No interesting plot no interesting characters. 9 years for a complete failure on my opinion. The idea was great and it could have been a hell of a story but it was just a waste of time. It isn't even a drama, nothing dramatic happens at all. I don't know what people saw in it and rated it with almost 9 stars. It surely does not worth to watch it at the cinema. If you want to watch something the time before bed its perfect cause all it can make you is to become sleepy."
BOYHOOD,26 January 2015,5/10,"So I literally just watched this movie and I know I won't be able to fall asleep without talking about it. First off I have to give credit where credit is due. The whole aspect of them making this movie over all the years, and the actors really aging is pretty cool and unique.But once you get over that this movie is absolutely awful. I mean it is the most predictable movie. If you asked anyone to write a movie about a boy growing up they could give you this script. ""oh we definitely need a drunken abusive father"" they say. ""well we had them divorce what to we do now?"" they ask ""another drunken abusive father...genius!"" ""We for sure need one of those cool biological fathers who shows up occasionally and gives life advice."" ""And what is any movie about growing up without a good old bullying or peer pressure scene."" ""Do they impact the movie plot at all?"" ""No, we just need one.""........these are all things the makers of the movie probably said.Also, just because the characters develop in age doesn't mean the don't have to develop on screen. The only character's that change at all are Ethan Hawk and that Mexican guy who took the mom's advice. And Ethan Hawks character change doesn't effect mason, he is still just a fun dad who shows up with advice. He just happens to have his life together the second half of the movie.Which brings me to the point of the not so subtle political messages. While Bush is president Ethan Hawks life sucks, but then Barak Obama comes along and he suddenly has a great family life....not so fast Linklater.Another point with the times changing was I feel like they just tried to sum up all of the 2000's with all the references to the days pop culture. I mean it was cool when they were reading Harry Potter, but then Here comes 2007 the year about Rip-sticks and Solja Boy, and then 2008 remember when everyone had a Wii. Yeah we do. Anyways my main problem with the movie is the writing is absolute garbage. I'm convinced they just copy and pasted some PSA commercials about bullying and teen pregnancy and all that stuff. Well this is quite long and mean so I will leave on a positive note. The Soundtrack was pretty great. And I have to give props to how they magically picked a child who would grow up to look just like Ethan Hawk.The End."
BOYHOOD,12 November 2014,5/10,"I love great movies. I have watched thousands of movies and I also am a critic, not professional though. But this is the most overrated movie I have ever seen.This is absolutely a mess. Okay, I thought, no kidding, once that there would be cool if someone actually cast some kid and shoot his life until a point like letting him turn 40. Thought it did not take that much but the movie is nothing special. Richard Linklater is known to me as the guy who did Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight. My point is his movies are the same. They are not expensive(not that I like only expensive ones), groundbreaking or exciting. Same story, two or more people-family-talking and talking and talking-quarreling on some unimportant point-last shot will be a little push towards reconciliation. Every movie of his ends with no solution of any kind. Does that mean the story is not over because the audience have to write it from then on? This movie has numbers of stupid people who call them critics calling it a movie of a lifetime or whatever. I don't see it anything other than taking 12 years of making it.The bar set by the movies like To Kill A Mocking Bird, Tree Of Life and Stand By Me explains one's childhood more vividly and so far as I know this movie had none of that kind of original scene. One's life goes on and you are forced to be a part of it. When you want to cover someone's life it takes a great talent and Richard Linklater has not that yet. Of course some scenes are good but I have seen all of them in Before Sunrise,Sunset and Midnight. He never changes his point of view or say point of direction.Okay this movie is not great than the two I mentioned above not even near to the greatness like Ben-Hur, Dr. Strangelove, All About Eve or like life-changing movies like The Shawshank Redemption, A Cloakwork Orange, Forrest Gump, Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Elephant Man, etc. I shouldn't even mention them because these are the best of all-time or a life-time.If you really wanna watch a great Boyhood movie...watch Charlie Chaplin's KID. I watched some great movies lately like 12 angry men, The Great Escape and Charlie Chaplin's City Lights and Modern Times and just yesterday Prisoners 2013. And I must say it is the worst movie I have seen in 2014. I have seen quarrels of this movie in Before Midnight.I have not a month ago watched Scream. And I am forced to say that it engaged me the more than this. This movie has no power scenes whatsoever until the so-many-times-already-used-ending.Let's talk about the acting....its terrible. The kid who is cast at the very first acts so bad compared to those who were great in 60s or 70s like To Kill A Mockingbird or Stand By Me. This kid feels like forced to act. His facial expressions are bad and even his sister is bad in some scenes and also sometimes the cast actors are bad and average. Eathan Hawke is Eathan Hawke. He plays himself in every single scene.Do not waste your time because you will be bored out of your mind. Go for some great kid's movies...like Stand By Me and To Kill A Mockingbird and October Sky or some other great growing-up kinda movie I don't recall. The same happened with me about 12 Years A Slave and Wolf Of Wall Street...over hyped myself and in reality found them lesser great.The only interesting thing about this movie is THE SAME KIDS/PEOPLE AGE OVERTIME. Dialogues are in same style as used in his other movies. Nothing Special. Not an Epic.Completely OVERRATED.Absolute justified rating 5/10. It is a 5 out of 10."
BOYHOOD,28 December 2014,10/10,"Richard Linklater brings us the juggernaut that is ""Boyhood"". Boyhood, is a roller coaster of emotion and sentiment, seen through the eyes of a young boy, over a span of 12 years.The film has a very intimate feeling that I have never experienced watching any other film. It was hard not to relate to Mason, through out some parts of his life. Goodbyes,first loves,lost friendships, and a constant struggle with the world around you.Boyhood is a once in a lifetime film, a movie where time is real. A film where we get to watch these characters grow, making them feel like they are a part of our own world.Certain people don't seem to praise Boyhood as much as other reviewers and critics have. Probably because there are no intense Hollywood- esque moments where a character gets an epiphany from the ""heavens"". Everything in Boyhood feels very real and personal, making it a very intimate and beautiful to watch.A journey like nothing ever seen in film."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,7/10,"3/4 Boyhood: A realistic story of the simple and subtle tragedies and joys of childhood and young adulthood without any perspectives on such things. Cinematographically frank and unfortunately disparate, the tale's sporadic thematic grasp did not quite live up to the scope of its production and ended up being more of a nostalgic tribute to the last fifteen years than an actually cohesive, gripping story or commentary on them. This film had the balancing act of being relatable and deep emotional storytelling and frequently shot at spots that missed both marks. But above all, the innovative style of literally watching the characters grow up gives this film not only visual but historical significance. The juvenile point of this film is summed up poorly in the awkward, choppy delivery of two teenagers the audience cares little about."
BOYHOOD,29 September 2015,6/10,"I'm not really sure what to think about this movie. Of course you have the whole coming of age story of a boy, filmed over 12 years, which was a cool idea, but other than that I didn't find it particularly exciting/interesting. A whole lot of nothing happens.I also found it kind of cheesy that each time they move further into the future, everyone's hairstyle's change to give you a hint. I haven't changed my hairstyle in 12 years... They did the same thing with brief shots of changing technology to further show you they're moving into the future.It was OK, but I definitely wouldn't call it an American classic."
BOYHOOD,3 January 2021,10/10,"This is one of those movies that I just didn't want to end. Pure, unadulterated experience."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,4/10,"Remove the gimmick - filming the same actors over a period of 12 years - and this is a dull movie without much interest.The movie folks seem amazed that this can be done and heaped many accolades on it. Sure, it is a difficult and unique project - but that does not make it a good movie.How about we judge a movie on its merits rather than the difficulty and audaciousness of making it? A mental exercise: take away using the same young actors throughout the 12 years and make the movie the usual way, i.e., use different actors for different ages and shoot the whole thing in 6 months or so. How good a movie would it be then? Mediocre is what.It is somewhat interesting to guess when the time frame has changed. Clues: hair style changes, different school different car, etc. It is also nice to see the young actors become mature. However, they never become very good actors - mostly stilted. The adult actors do a fine, professional job. However, the story is mostly non-existent. The movie is not sure whether it is pretending to be a documentary or a drama. Nothing much happens except some banal slice-of-life moments. The movie ends for no apparent reason. It just stops. Maybe the 12 year contracts ran out and the participants said hell no to extensions. It is a wonder they did not try to break out of this this thing earlier.Somewhat worth seeing, but beware of spending 2.5+ hours sitting through the thing. There are many better movie options on which to spend your money and time."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,1/10,"As you can figure from the summary, I am here to bring the rate down. because 8.2 star (as I review this) was not justified this movie.The story revolves around Mason, for 12 years of his life. and as everybody said, this movie is using the same cast filming for 12 years.I understand the value of this signature but let me remind you. this is not a Documentary or a story based on true event. it is fictional so first priority must come to writing!.and boy, the writing is awful. they managed to make a story less interesting than a 12 years story of any regular boys out there. Mason changing school, meeting new friends, abused by his step father, got a girlfriend, morph to an emo, he got into photography... what could be more MAINSTREAM than that!? Mason have no Depth, have no motivation, Mason is a loser with no direction of life and still not projecting any compassion to his mother.some drama make you laugh, some make you cry, some make you think deep about life, some make you want to hug your loved one. boyhood does not do any of that. 8.2 rating is a trap! only movie hipster critics rate this movie high because of the ""art"" and ""gimmick"". so if you are a normal person who wants a good story and a good time, don't watch this. this movie is just 3 hours of watching a boy gradually lose his cuteness and acting skill.*sorry for my bad English."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,9/10,"my review is fairy random,but I truly liked this storytelling movie. Olivia,the well educated,well paid mother , cried that""i thought there will be more"" makes me feel we really have to try hard to live life to the fullest. what will be ,will be. try to leave less room for regrets,confusion ..as finally you will find that between born and death,you truly LIVED in between. i loved the lyrics of the birthday "" departure and arrival happens at the same time""..we are seized by the moment,so what you gonna do? ENJOY well, I guess if the director lives long enough,he could have movies like ""middle-age"" ""old-age""...maybe that would be great to call these 3 movies as ""the glory and dream of a generation"" well, last but not the least,haircut is very important ;p -- the 12 years' change of Mason pretty much explained this :D"
BOYHOOD,1 February 2015,1/10,"Please save yourself 3 hours of your life and READ THIS BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE.I'm sorry to those who want to say this was a profound movie...I feel sorry for you. This by far was one of the most unimaginative movies I have seen EVER! The continues praise of how ""REAL"" this movie is.. REALLY? If I wanted to watch reality I watch a documentary.. there is a reason why we have documentaries and why we have movies.. this was not entertaining, thought provoking or even remotely imaginative. Yes it took 12 years to make.. so what? I mean they had 12 years to think of a story? Or give some meat to these actors to chew on. I don't understand how there are so many awards and nominations this movie is getting.. It's as if people who watch movies and who are suppose to be 'CRITICS' forgotten what a movie is suppose to be or how to be critical. I'm not a critic but I have spent years and years watching movies and I can tell the difference between what's good and what's not.. what's art and what's sh*t rolled in glitter.Let me break it down: Story = none. Acting = uninspiring, shallow. Character = one dimensional. Cinematography = point and shoot. Directing = Great, imaginative. Writing = none existent If a movie has no story, no real depth in character or breaking boundaries in cinematic techniques then it's not a good movie. I do appreciate the fact that this is a unique movie in terms of it's actual built but in terms of a movie.. NO!I didn't feel a second of inspiration when watching it and now feeling angry that it's taken 3 hours of my life. This year's movies have been the worst in years.. at lease the positive side of things is.. at least it won't take me long to forget this movie.."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,8/10,"Well actually this is not my type of movie, but it was good. I know it's boring and means nothing really, and it's more like a documentary, but! It had something that none of the other movies I watched had and that's why I rated it 8. In all other movies we watch, we see unrealistic lives of unreal people. OK, let's forget those sci- fi movies or thrillers and just focus on those related to family. All of them have a climax, right? In almost every movie of that kind you see something interesting happening and you may even become excited at some points. But that's the thing! Do your lives have so many interesting and exciting events? Seriously think about it. What is your routine? What do you do every day and week and month? What is so much exciting about your life? Well, I can dare say that that's exactly showing our lives. What's the point of this life? It's not disappointing at all in my opinion. It helps us open our eyes wider and see what exactly is happening to our lives. We're normal people, living normal lives we're not like heroes or heroines or I don't know some special extraordinary character. Of course every one is unique and we are all characters of our lives's story. But think deeply about your life. You didn't like watching three hours of a documentary-like movie and well, you don't like your life too, then. Because our lives are exactly like that! If we have no big aim or goal something worthy, then we're going nowhere. We have so many ups and downs in our lives, but most of us don't always have something extraordinary or unearthly coming, right? I know there are some people who have really exciting lives but that doesn't include everybody. I'm talking about ordinary people with ordinary lives. If we don't have a good and worthy aim, what's the point of this life? Think about it. I'm not advertising nihilism, i'm just trying to say that we have to do something not to let our lives get finished like that. We should live in a way that when we're 40 and we look back we find a good life and when we look forward we see a bright future both for ourselves and our family. We shouldn't end up like The Mother - Olivia. Movies are not always supposed to tell you something that you can accept at once sometimes they show a negative point that you have to defamiliarize yourself with and try not to be like that and not accept it! You know what I mean? I didn't give it 8 because of its 12 years production and stuff which some find the only interesting point, I gave it 8 stars because it made me reconsider my life. I don't want to end up like Olivia thinking that it was all pointless the effort I had in my life. I don't want to end up thinking what's the point of this life? I have to do something big for my life and it doesn't have to be so big like universal or something, you don't have to become famous, but do something that makes you worthy and valuable something that makes your life valuable. That's how I see the movie. It was boring and had nothing but doesn't it seem a little familiar?!"
BOYHOOD,30 January 2015,2/10,"So this movie came out with a very intriguing premise in that they took the same actors and told a story across 12 years of filming. That's cool, that's a really neat idea. There's a lot of potential there. Too bad none of it was used. The movie is very realistic, a claim that it sticks to desperately throughout its whole three hour running span. The main focus is the titular boy and his journey to adulthood, but throughout this whole experience he never really does anything. Events occasionally happen around him, but they don't really have any lasting impact on his character. Again, the main premise of the movie is the fact that the actors were filmed over a period of 12 years, which I will constantly and readily admit is a very, very cool idea. The thing is, though, the acting steadily gets worse over this period. I was genuinely interested toward the beginning but by the end I was just watching the clock to see how much time was left. I don't know if this was the fault of the actors or the writing, but neither seemed particularly stellar. Overall I'd say that unless you're trying to take in as many Oscar nominations as possible, this movie, despite all its hype, is one to avoid."
BOYHOOD,31 January 2015,5/10,"I get that The fact it was filmed over a 12 year period. That Is very unique. The realism was great. The acting was very very good. But nothing interesting happens. It's a home movie about a dysfunctional family. The reason no one takes home movies about their domestic abuse and divorces is because no one wants to see that, unless there is an interesting story about it. Other than that, nothing else happens in this movie. The characters aren't even particularly likable or unlikable. You never really get to know them because you see them at different times in their life for a very short period of time. It was like looking through a family photo album of someone you don't know for three hours. No depth into the story or the characters. I love subtlety in a movie, but this was just boring. I thought I would love this movie but, it's much ado about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,10/10,"First of all, the idea tempted me: A boy ages before our eyes, in real time, without aging with makeup or casting another actor. And not just the boy, his parents, sister and everybody he knew along the way. So BOYHOOD is really a ""once in a lifetime movie"". As a girl myself I had a chance to view life from a boy's eyes. And life can change. A girl may be so talkative in early ages but gets quiet as she grows up. A boy who has a world of his own, playing xbox n stuff, may come out of his shell and have something to say, stand up for himself. ""Life doesn't give you tampons"". That's my favourite line :) You must fall and get up. Have some break ups to find ""the one"". You gotta see the good in bad. Even if you think: what's the point in all this? It HAS a point. And eventually everything gets in line. You just have to be patient. Like in the movie, Mason's father changes totally. This İs what I understand from the movie so if you read some comments saying ""it's a waste of time"", don't believe them. They may not have enough life experience to understand the movie. Personally I LOVED the movie. It's worth watching."
BOYHOOD,28 June 2015,8/10,"I personally believe that 'Boyhood' has received a lot of unfair criticism. Bottom line is by the end of the film you will either be left with a warm heart or ...u will not even finish the movie.When i first heard about this movie being nominated for Oscars, i was like ""well, its a cute family movie for America shot over 12 years. not a big deal"" only that it was shot for..well...12years. I Decided to watch it with my mom and was very pleased with what i had watched. in fact, i even managed to get one of those choke sensations that u get when ur bout to become a sissy and cry. This was how nostalgic id felt after the film.i hate to admit it but this is kinda my kind of movie among of course action, thriller and suspense films that have an actual story line. The fact that Boyhood is about life from childhood to adulthood, plainly put, and that it goes further to strengthen this development using real life growth of the protagonist, makes this movie one of the best I've ever watched.As you watch Boyhood, you find yourself loving the movie more and more as it goes on not only because its the same characters growing for real, but also that you empathize and feel like part of the family. I for one am a big fan of 'Medium' and Patricia Arquette and i thought she brought out a caring but tough love mother that is not very different from her character on 'Medium'. Ethan Hawke plays Dad and surprisingly manages to be part of Mason & Sam's lives through to when Mason graduates high school. Sam is of-course Mason's big sis who grows form little adorable diva into a contentious outgoing young lady. Mason himself is able to maintain a cool demeanor throughout his development in the film while exploring and discovering his passion in life even though his father wasn't always around.Watching Boyhood is a real life journey through time that makes you remember your own Boyhood/Girlhood through these characters. don't hate on this film simply because the plot doesn't have a defined conclusion or that there is no developing story. Love it for its spirit and uniqueness."
BOYHOOD,14 June 2015,4/10,My friend said this was filmed from 2002-2013. I was so intrigued and so excited to watch this.After watching the film I was left super disappointed. Like super disappointed. Like seriously super disappointed. It was kind of boring. I mean it was boring. So boring I find myself repeating the words and wanting to fill this whole review with the words boring and disappointed. When the movie ended I felt lost. I did not understand my purpose in life (like seriously) & why I sat for 2 hours and 45 minutes watching this film.I don't know... this could have been a great film. It is really overrated.
BOYHOOD,6 April 2017,9/10,This movie brings back lot of memories from childhood.. Even though I am from India.. I could totally relate to the boy.. Boyhood an awesome feeling. I loved all LinkLaters movie and this my favorite.. The discussion the bay has with his father.. The carefree attitude in teenage.. The first girlfriend.. And most of all the back ground score and the song ..Linklater hit the chords right and everyone can relate to this movie. One of the must watch movies
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,4/10,"While I watched the movie I kept thinking that something was going to happen.That there was more to this movie than to watch a screwed up woman live a screwed up life and drag her children through it.Then finally near the end of the movie Patricia Arquette, the mother, summed up the whole movie experience for me in a nutshell. In one line:""I just thought there would be more ...""I did not hate the movie. It wasn't as if I wanted the director to give me back 165 minutes (yes, that long of a movie) of my life. But ... It just wasn't THAT interesting of a movie.The concept of the movie was novel, that of making a movie over 12 years time, but that was the entire creative aspect of the movie. Nothing else was all that interesting."
BOYHOOD,29 July 2020,1/10,Worst film I've ever seen. Never watch this film. This film is awful.
BOYHOOD,10 January 2017,10/10,"This film, I know is not for everyone however if it clicks with you it won't just be a small enjoyment, you'll love it. The writing is fantastic and for me anyway I didn't feel like it was long at all, it flowed fantastically and I enjoyed every minute of it. Patricia Arquette is superb along with many other actors including the main man Eltar Coltrane who was brilliant throughout. What makes this film even better is that we see the growth of this man but it is believable and that really helps in making this masterpiece.I fully recommend this film but I do realise that it won't work for everyone, however give it a try and it might just work for you and honestly it is the best film I have ever seen."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2017,4/10,I find this movie so damn overrated. Got an Oscar and so many people recommended it to me. The only tag in this movie on IMDb is drama which is accurate since there's no comedy or anything else besides drama and the drama itself isn't even that much While there was drama here and there it wasn't really something that mattered. There were some important moments in the movie which obviously are so important that they should be shown or talked about again but it's just so straight forward. I feel no connection with Mason or the characters really. It's not a feel good story either. Kinda felt like wasting 2 and a half hour.
BOYHOOD,16 July 2017,10/10,"It takes a great amount of faith and patience to create something like that. I mean 12 years! I watched this film first in 2014, and re- watched it few years later...now. I remember that after watching it for the first time, I felt a great amount of peace coming upon me. This film makes you let go of your worries. It surrounds you with trust, love and #pixie dust. Thank you to everyone who made this come true."
BOYHOOD,7 September 2014,1/10,"Pretty much all movies, which I ever liked, are highly rated on IMDb. Although not all highly rated movies on IMDb are movies which I like. And this is one of them.The movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point. Cool. That's it. Nothing else.It was a cliché scene after cliché scene for almost three hours. Three hours which I'll never get back :) I'd rate it with negative 3, but there's no rating lower than 1.Sometimes, a movie starts bad. It goes on for a while, but then, at the end, something new and unique happens and you think: ""Oh! I totally did not expect that. So it was worth seeing it"". Well. Not now. Bad start, middle, and end. Oh, he met another girl. Really. They like each other? Is this how people who like each other act?The acting was so poor and just about every line said, was said in so unnatural way. Real people in real situations, simply do not look like or act like that. I felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters. None of them seemed to have any social skills.None of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives. They had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations. The plot for such conversations goes like: ""blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blah""."
BOYHOOD,14 December 2017,2/10,"I was expecting an excellent viewing experience, instead there was three hours of tedium. It was painful to watch all the drama and disappointment that the central character experienced. There seemed to be more JudgeJudy than Ozzie and Harriet in this film. Emotional pain does not equal insight or entertainment."
BOYHOOD,9 January 2018,1/10,"I am sure people will hit ""No"" on this review just because they hate my headline. Now ""Boyhood"" was about watching a child growing up. Yes it was filmed over several years but the film itself felt like it took ""years to watch"".The film would have been better served if the director cut the film down by 30 minutes. Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. However the story is really about seeing his loser of a mother not realizing she is doomed to keep repeating her mistakes. Take it from me ""This film is only loved by people who want to sound superior"""
BOYHOOD,28 June 2020,,"In Robert McKee's book, Story, he writes that ""story is not life in actuality,"" however Boyhood is simply a timelapse study of a boy's life. If you also acknowledge its often awkward performances and mediocre cinematography, you'd think this coming-of-age epic to be a time-consuming catastrophe.But I think these components of an uninspiring film are what make Linklater's ambitious project such a success. Boyhood is a story about life and most people's lives are... uninspiring. It's raw and relatable, unassuming yet groundbreaking. It captures the essence of life and in the process, our hearts."
BOYHOOD,4 December 2018,3/10,"I didn't really pay attention to it when it came out, I just noticed it got really good reviews. So I watched it on Netflix last night. Let me just say, this movie is shot incredibly well. The scenes most of the time are beautiful, colorful, and the ambience is usually very good. The idea by Linklater to film a movie while the actors grow up is unique, different and very intriguing. This backfired on Linklater because Ellar Coltrane progressively started to become a worse and worse actor as this movie was filmed. The more complex lines and emotions he had to convey, his performance just got more and more disappointing. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke did amazing jobs. They were stellar throughout the whole movie, very convincing, but the dialogue in some parts of the movie was unrealistic. I thought the plot - a coming of age story - was not well planned out. It lacked a conclusion, which I wasn't really expecting much of one, but if you don't have one, at least make the ending meaningful in some way. Another thing about the movie I didn't like was the random scenes that didnt get acknowledged ever again throughout the film. Why would you add these points in the film when they have no impact on the characters? Some of it is genius, don't get me wrong, but when the bullies confront him and they never are seen again or have an impact on Mason, there is no point
The first hour of the movie was great, it made me keep watching. The next 45 minutes were okay, and still made me want to finish the film, but to be completely honest, I had to skip parts in the last 45 minutes. I thought the ending was cringy - not funny - and even the beginning endures some cringiness, but it just gets worse. I would give this movie 1 star because of how bad the plot is and the main actor at the end, but the idea behind it and the good beginning make me give it a 3 instead.Tldr; Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette had amazing performances and the idea behind the whole movie is different, but it did not make up for: the subpar plot lacking a conclusion, the poorly written script, the random scenes that never impact the characters or are relevant, and the terrible acting by Ellar Coltrane."
BOYHOOD,1 August 2014,10/10,"Today, I had the pleasure of experiencing Richard Linklater's pet project ""Boyhood"". This is easily the greatest cinematic experience I've had in a long time. Considering Linklater is one of my favorite working directors, I am happy to say that high expectations were surpassed; this is his best work to date. The concept of filming for 12 years could've easily come off as a gimmick but thankfully Linklater, who is one of the least self-indulgent and relaxed directors out there, uses this ambition with natural depth and substance; the 12 year deal is icing on the cake. This is top notch filmmaking on a technical and emotional level. One of the best traits about Linklater is that he never overplays tear-jerking situations or gets unrealistically dramatic; he really understands the human soul. It's an epic yet charming, honest and down to earth film. I feel like just about anybody could resonate with it in some way. I can easily see this going down as a universally loved American classic right next to films like ""12 Angry Men"", ""Pulp FIction"" and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". I strongly recommend it to everybody; it's truly a film that deserves to be seen. I can't thank everyone involved with making this masterwork enough for being so patient. I think it dethrones ""There Will Be Blood"" as my favorite film of the 21st century thus far. Go see it!"
BOYHOOD,9 October 2019,1/10,"This was literally the most boring movie I have ever seen in 49 years, in fact absolutely everything related to this movie was boring... including the acting.This is also my first movie review in the same amount of time as I felt I really had to warn you not to watch this."
BOYHOOD,20 May 2019,9/10,"It's true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without."
BOYHOOD,7 April 2020,10/10,"When I first saw Boyhood, I knew right away I had seen something special. Watching it was truly unforgettable. I remember the place, the time and the feeling after my first viewing. It is a movie that I come back to time after time and each time I'm left with a strong feeling nostalgia, calm and wonder. It spoke to and connected me to cinema, I was truly able comprehend the magic of cinema, how a person can fall in love with movies.The premise for Boyhood is simple: what does it mean to grow up, become an adult, and live? It's a coming of age story of boy shot over the course of 12 years, each year Richard Linklater reunited the same cast and shot segments of the film. At 165 minutes, this dramatic epic had me just yearning for more. I wanted to see their journeys continue, and just relish in this dream a bit longer. Linklaters's ability to capture people, their experience and a life and render it into film is magical. The dialogs are touching and feel natural. The soundtrack soars and carries you off in a perfect state of sadness and joy.Ellar Coltrane is simply stupendous. As you watch his transformation before your eyes, scene after scene, year after year, it's impressive how Coltrane interprets Mason understanding his confusions, realizing his flaws. Lorelei Linklater is every bit as brilliant as any person in the cast, she is annoying, awkward and sweet and you fall in love with her transformation from girl to woman. Ethan Hawke showcases an eager willingness to connect with his children, it is a sensational and compelling look into fatherhood and being human. Patricia Arquette is the emotional center of the film with her beautiful and captivating performance as a mother desperately trying to live the life she dreamed of whilst making a life for her children. When she says ""I thought there would be more"" you instantly think about your own family life and its constant flux. This film spans from bedtime stories to packing for college. It encompasses how the parent-child relationship changes and matures with life and aging.The film is about milestones in life including phases of inevitable ugliness, aspirations for the future, mistakes of the past, uncertainty of the present and much more. It really just shows how little moments in our lives when were growing up really make up who we are. It made me realize that one day we will look back and inevitably ask ourselves: where on earth did the time go?"
BOYHOOD,2 April 2021,3/10,"This movie should be called ""Let's waste everybody's time"""
BOYHOOD,2 January 2020,2/10,"I don't want my dentist, my boss or my hair stylist ranting on about their political views... and I am totally SICK of Hollyweird's soap box. When Ethan Hawke attacked the President within a few moments into the film, it turned me off so I turned it off. Get over it already... the McCarthy Era (which, was questionable anyway) was over 70 years ago... you weren't even alive!!!"
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,3/10,"An interesting concept completely ruined by the insistence of the filmmakers to throw in liberal political bias, such as the worship of Barack Obama and the trashing of George W. Bush and Sarah Palin. It was about as subtle as a nuclear blast. I didn't appreciate at all the portrayal of Republicans as confederate flag rednecks. But then again, it's that type of thing gets a film all kinds of awards and critical acclaim these days. What a pity. Otherwise, the performances of the principle actors, particularly Patricia Arquette, were first rate and the message of the hardship of growing up male in the 21st century is still there and rings true, though I think a mothers tolerance of her sons drinking and smoking marijuana is something of a stretch."
BOYHOOD,18 August 2014,3/10,"I went to see this because of the high reviews here (and everywhere else). I was disappointed because while the acting was very good, there was no suspense. There was not a plot in the conventional sense. There was no crisis for the protagonist to overcome. You just watched as some people that were very real (you saw the good and bad in them) as they went about their lives. It was just so slow and long. Obviously, many people like this movie. Just beware that while the unconventionality of having the same actors playing their characters over several years is groundbreaking, the plot is very slow and does not have the normal conflict and resolution that you see in a movie. While the characters do grow or age physically, they do not seem to grow emotionally and come out at the end of the movie with some great insight from having been through the events in the movie."
BOYHOOD,1 September 2014,6/10,"The Linklater VersionThis seemingly cute film is built around the ebbs and flows of attachment and detachment over twelve years in a boy's life (and a girl's also). Mason's mother teaches college courses on that subject, as does one of his abusive stepfathers. Despite all the missteps that everyone makes, Mason does grow up, not unscathed. This is, superficially, a feel-good ""everyboy's tale."" But that's a masquerade. Every character, every relationship between mother and child, child and mother, parent and parent, adult and adult, every conversation, and every heart-to-heart talk is a wincing platitude, one we've all heard thousands of times. The entire 165-minute film is built around these platitudes—about neatness, eating, dressing, studying, dating, screwing, graduating, driving, and any other topic you can imagine. Linklater has compiled the encyclopedia of clichéd talk. It's of course what most of us do, and it's stultifying to see it on the big screen. Even Mason's teenage photographs are platitudes—a rusty fire hydrant, a lonely traffic light, etc. Ditto for the sewer repair guy whom Mom advises, ""you're smart, you should get an education."" And when Mom runs into him later, managing a restaurant, he thanks her, ""you changed my life."" Of course. By that point in a film that is the Moby Dick of platitudes, it's just what you'd expect him to say.No wonder I squirmed during the film and was depressed when I left the theater. Is this junk what it's about? At one point, Linklater has Mom more or less summarize her own life as one long cliché: you live, you love, you lose, you die. And he even has Mason deliver a lecture en route to college on how humans are half robots and how our lives are captured and controlled from without (hello, NSA), leaving us slaves. It's that inevitable template of life that Linklater is really presenting. Life is a track.This cynicism shouldn't come as a surprise. It was precisely what Linklater did in Before Midnight, which is 109 minutes of a spite marriage that had started, as we know from two previous films, as a charming Parisian romance. There too Linklater worked around a cliché, of a marriage gone sour. Jesse wants to do what he wants, and Celine delivers one vicious feminist broadside after another (a terrible disservice to feminism). The film was his homage to Godard's Contempt. Boyhood is his Texas version of Truffaut's Antoine Doinel series, with a dash of Godard's Le Gai Savoir. After Boyhood, we should all banish platitudes from our mental bank. I'm taking an oath to be as original as I can be in what I say to myself and to those I'm close to. And I'm putting everyone I know on notice to catch me, nicely, when I veer into cliché."
BOYHOOD,21 March 2021,9/10,The movie doesnt have a plot line or any action and no the boy doesnt turn into superman after a traumatic childhood and save the world.This movie is unique and creative and brings something fresh on the table and thats why i love it.
BOYHOOD,22 May 2021,10/10,"This must be one of the best movies i've ever watched. I saw it the first time in 2014 when I was 12 myself, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about how my own life reflects on the thoughts that the movie touches upon. I've just watched it for the second time, 7 years later, and it had the same effect.I can only recommend it, but in my opinion you should watch it. No doubt."
BOYHOOD,18 March 2015,1/10,"I do not understand why this movie have such a high rate. OK. Maybe because of length of filming this movie. But this was not impressed me. I do not care if movie is filmed in one day or 10 years, if the movie is great. But this movie is so boring. I fell asleep after one and a half hour. And when I saw that I am not even on half of the movie, I just quit watching. Usually when start watching, I watch every film till the end. But this movie is too boring. It is a waste of time.The story is nothing special. Boring, boring, boring. If you like movies with greater point than just watching someones boring life, I do not recommend this movie.1/10. The movie is not that shitty, but do not deserve such a high rate. So I gave a 1 out of 10."
BOYHOOD,21 November 2021,2/10,This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. It's slow and has no depth to the characters either. Not worth the watch. It jumps in time to the point where you don't get attached to a story line or characters. Overall bad acting and screen writing. I honestly don't have anything good to say about this movie.
BOYHOOD,27 August 2014,10/10,"My wife and I went to ""Boyhood"" on its opening day in Christchurch, New Zealand. We had recently seen the trailer and were keen to see the film. It did not disappoint us. The acting was excellent--so good that at times we found we forgot we were watching a movie rather than a documentary. It was great to see an understated American movie rather than the overblown dialogue* and direction we so often see/hear. It's a long movie, but time just flew! We have two adult sons, and although life and culture in NZ is not the same as shown in ""Boyhood"" we found many situations in the movie which struck a chord for us. I would write more, but other reviewers have expressed it, much better than I. Suffice it to say, of all the movies I have seen in the last 68 years, this one goes straight into my Top 10. *(what I call the Seinfeld syndrome: ""There's a joke coming RAISE EYEBROWS, LOOK AT CAMERA . . . did you get that--I'll say it again"")"
BOYHOOD,5 November 2014,1/10,"I am so disappointed in this movie.The ratings gave me high expectations for this movie. But I feel really let down.This movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of growing up and going through life.It is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as ""real"" as possible. But this is not reality. Reality has more emotion, more struggle, more comedy, and more life.Life is not an objective biography or recollection of events. It is a subjective frenzy.I can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive.TL;DR: This movie about life is more boring than life itself."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2015,4/10,"The novelty of watching the characters age over the years, especially the children, was the only redeeming quality of this movie. And there are enough Youtube videos of children aging to make even this that interesting. The story itself was boring. Quite boring. I was constantly waiting for something ""big"" to happen and then watch how it affected the characters over the years, but nothing really ever happened. Some may argue that the film and plot are more subtle and what happened in the boys life (mom moves and remarries 2-3 times) made him the somewhat cynical, introvert that he became, but 165 minutes isn't worth dedicating to see this."
BOYHOOD,2 March 2015,9/10,"In tracking the life of a boy from early childhood to early adulthood, Linklater tells a story of everyman. His protagonist Mason, could be any one of us. But his genius lies in the way that all other members of Mason's family evolve and develop in ways that are both moving and believable. Many films strike false notes in their artificial development of character arcs. In Boyhood, the characters grow and change before our very eyes without recourse to silly plot contrivances or coincidences.The sheer persistence and bravery demonstrated by Linklater in the making of this film, the fact that, to my knowledge, nobody really knew anything about it until it burst on the screen, are amazing in themselves. However, none of this would signify anything more than a fascinating tale about film making, if the end result were not such a powerful story in its own right. Linklater constantly satisfies our desire to know ""what happens next"" and for me that is the essence of great storytelling. There's not a false note in the acting performances and certainly no sense of an ensemble cast maybe getting too comfortable in their dramatic interactions."
BOYHOOD,4 November 2014,10/10,"As for most of us, we are drawn into ""Boyhood"" for Linklater's interesting new take on filming a cast for over a span of a decade. Something that has never been done before is always intriguing to watch. The technique does help build a strong attachment to his characters, however, the story becomes so interesting that it sucks in its viewer that one forgets how beautifully and patiently this movie was directed.That was the only thing I knew coming into this movie, and that Linklater somehow got a young promising Ethan Hawke on board. I am glad I did not know more. Explaining the movie could not be easier, take a guess, it's about boyhood. The point of the movie is not about what could happen at the end,but about the journey and how we get to the end. When the screen fades to black you almost don't want to see it leave because you feel like a big part of it.So how does Linklater captures the general idea of everyone's ""Boyhood"" through only the eyes of one kid? Linklater does not focus solely on the kid. Linklater helps build the image of a family by focusing on all the family members and their emotions throughout. This helps the audience feel apart of that family, and more importantly, apart of his ""BoyHood.""Linklater highlights the key points and small details, in the boys life that shape out to who he becomes.It is one of those movies you'll never forget. It is an epic journey that can be very easy to relate to. Everyone goes through different situations and we all come out as different people. But how we cope those situations is a struggle everyone goes through when trying to find themselves."
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,3/10,"In short: don't watch it if you're not from the US.The idea of following a group of people over 11 years gives an interesting insight into how people grow up (although arguably you're seeing more closely how the director has 'grown up' and aged), but artificial over-scripting of life, and the blandness and shallowness of the story is what lets it down.The reviews: wonderful acting, a one-of-a-kind (first-of-its-kind) masterpiece, a moving reflection on life are all subjective, and most likely will mean little to non United States of America citizens.The acting was shabby at best, with its quality constantly yoyo-ing throughout the film (again, a reflection on the aging of the director/actors). Most characters were very shallow with little to relate to except the act of 'growing up' which is a no brainer. It would have been nice if their aging wasn't given centre stage, and instead the main stories/activities of their lives featuring and their aging being a side-effect (as it is in 'real' life).A one of a kind and first of its kind film? In the UK, there has been a documentary film series ongoing for over 50 years called the 'Up Series'. A much broader and interesting set of films which certainly was a first of its kind. With Boyhood being US-oriented, I can see why it has had such rave reviews - there just hasn't been anything similar in those lands. Unfortunately, for those who aren't from the US there's little to relate to and much better alternatives.Seeing Boyhood in this year's Goldn Globe winners list hits the nail right on the head with how the US-centric the film is. It's been a great hit there, and that's absolutely fine. Just keep it to yourself and don't export 3 hours of drivel to the rest of the world.Disclaimer: I watched the second half of the film on 1.3x because I just couldn't hack the dull and meaningless story. I may have failed to pick up on some subtleties, but there weren't (m)any."
BOYHOOD,9 February 2015,2/10,"Wow, how stupid are human beings that think by filming for 12 years equates to a masterpiece. Poor script, diabolical acting by the Brother and Sister, I don't have a problem with a film not having a plot if it's well written and well acted, this had neither. If filming for a prolonged period of time deserves award recognition then surely Michael Winterbottoms Everyday should have won more awards than Platoon and the Godfather put together, maybe people should watch that rather than this tripe. I will be extremely surprised if the Brother and Sister were even seen as extras in Hollyoaks in the future. I enjoy watching the Oscars, last years films were rightfully nominated, Dallas Buyers Club and the Wolf of Wall Street deserved the acclaim they received. Boyhood deserves nothing apart from compensation being paid to everybody that lost the three hours of their lives sitting through the dour boring nonsense. Please diet Patricia, you used to be hot.""two jobs back it was a four man job"""
BOYHOOD,26 January 2015,2/10,"While I applaud Richard Linklater's dedication to the project, the twelve years seem to have been wasted.The acting is poor. There's no other way to say it. As many of us are aware, child actors are learning the trade, but they aren't problem with this. I understand the schedule was 45 days of filming over twelve years and it shows. You can see the lack of relationship between parents and offspring, they just don't have chemistry. Daughter looks through mother, father talks at son like he's not actually there.The worst part of the acting by far is Marco Perella, whose laughable overacting and flailing motions stood out enough for me to have to mention them. I realise he's supposed to be a drunk, but alcohol would've improved his performance.Worst of all is the fact that nothing happens. Maybe it's because I'm British but the height of entertainment where nothing happens was The Royle Family. At least that The Royle Family managed to have lives without actually leaving their living room. In Boyhood, Mason Sr. has another baby with his girlfriend (although he is wearing a wedding ring, no mention of a marriage) and that news is seemingly tossed aside, as though a new life, a new sibling, is of no consequence. The characters are incomplete and the plot had so much potential. Lorelei Linklater's request to her father/director to be killed off four years in would've actually added some substance to an otherwise dull affair.Now, who can I talk to about getting a refund on my two hours and forty-five minutes?"
BOYHOOD,27 July 2014,10/10,"A young Mason (Ellar Coltrane) lies on his back and stares blissfully above; there is no narration or insight into his thoughts. His motive is unclear, but he offers a look of inspired contemplation. The moment then simply passes, and he moves on. This is a film not akin to other melodrama filled, coming-of-age narratives. There is no life-changing moment, no tragic event, it is rather an unassuming observation of youth and the fleeting nature of life.Richard Linklater was the subject of significant media interest last year when he released details of a 12 year project; a single film following the same cast throughout the early 21st century. We watch Mason, his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette), and father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) mature and age before our very eyes. Similar concepts have been done before, but never before has such a timespan been documented into one compact viewing experience. This is a minimalist epic; an understated narrative yet a landmark for cinematic achievement.The premise is very simple; we follow Mason from ages seven to 18 as he struggles with being a child of divorce. We see both parents through various relationships, and thus find both children constantly moving homes and without stability. The children grow, have complicated school lives, find their interests, graduate, and eventually go to college. Therein lies the entire story. The beauty of the film lies not in the plot, but in its subtlety, themes and nostalgia. We see an innocent child obsessing over Harry Potter, watching Dragon Ball Z, and playing Game Boy, before watching that same child drive, smoke, and drink alcohol. Characteristic of Linklater, he never shows us the typical milestone events; we never see Mason learn to ride a bike, his first photograph, or his first kiss. Not every moment in the film is of significance, but the cumulative experience truly reflects the ebb and flow of life. These seemingly small, ordinary moments are some of the most powerful. An early scene shows the family moving for the first time. As they are driving away, Mason sees his best friend trying to keep up on his bike, waving. He never said goodbye, and he'll never see him again. They never make a big deal of these scenes, yet there are plenty of them in the film, and they happen just as naturally as those moments we overlook in our own lives. The sparse, unconventional tale would not hold together without the exceptional acting on display. Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater bring their characters to life, but the parents are the ones that truly excel. Hawke is brilliant as the freewheeling, not quite grown up father, offering humour and advice to the reserved children. Likewise, Arquette is flawless as the troubled mother. A deeply complicated role, Olivia lives her life still believing a textbook husband-wife-two-children is the key to happiness. In a brilliant comparison of social conditioning and youthful naïveté, Olivia asks Samantha for understanding in wanting to build a ""family"" with a new boyfriend, to which Samantha angrily replies, ""We already have a family!"" Sheer in scope, with more production and cooperation problems than we could even imagine, Boyhood is a miracle. Rare is it that a film both encapsulates what cinema is about, as well as expands on what it could become. It is the best movie of the year, and could very well become the most accomplished film of the generation. Linklater, with another masterpiece, yet again proves that when casting time as a lead actor, his directorial hand is unmatched."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,6/10,"Despite being a good movie, I am feeling a little bit confuse why this movie is considered it a masterpiece or something. I like the movie, nice performances, great cast, but it seems to me a random movie with nothing special about it! I really don't get it people... To me the screenplay is weak and doesn't bring nothing new to movies, sometimes boring and predictable. Along the movie I was hoping some big life changes from the characters and unfortunely disappointed me! Movies like Gone Girl or The Grand Budapest Hotel are far better in every level, because brouhgt new ideas and the storytelling are great and astonishing. Therefore ""Boyhood"" was disillusion to me!"
BOYHOOD,5 March 2016,1/10,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, terrible script, no plot, too long. Cheesy after-school special scenes with cliché, one- dimensional characters. The lovable loser dad. The single mom who has to pull herself up by the bootstraps. The a-hole abusive 2nd husband. What a joke. And don't get me started about the kid. I don't give a rat's ass about the boring brat. Negative stars ................. ................ ................... .............. ..................... ........................ ............... ........... ......... ..... ............. .......... ............... ......."
BOYHOOD,19 September 2014,7/10,"As a generalisation, if you already reflect on your life and question your existence then this movie may come across as very unremarkable. However, if you do not regularly reflect on your life then some moments in this movie will be quite profound and moving.Without doubt, most people will be able to relate to the events of Boyhood as the movie makes insightful observations about the way we learn and live our lives in western society. However, I feel the execution was off at these potentially powerful moments and I couldn't help but cringe at the delivery of some of these scenes.I am certainly glad Richard Linklater tried to implement some depth into a movie that was largely about everyday events, but these important scenes felt forced and didn't make as strong of an impact as it could have."
BOYHOOD,24 August 2014,4/10,"A good film with honest, insightful dialog between characters that succeeds in portraying the realities of relationships which are often far from perfect. It was similar to the ""Before"" movies of Linklater in that regard, but the ""Before"" movies did not meander so far into the mundane as this movie did. I know the movie was an effort to reflect the real life of a boy growing up--and the typical boyhood experiences. But in an effort to reflect the reality of life's not-so-exciting parts, Linklater undercut the punctuation of the exciting events and stages of life. If this movie were about 1/2 hour shorter I could have rated it much higher. And a shorter, better edited version of this movie would have allowed it to receive the larger national audience it deserves, rather than the art-indie film following it has now."
BOYHOOD,13 December 2014,7/10,"Amidst this zest around Richard Linklater's most audacious project till date,somehow or someway we all are missing a point.I'll explain it later. Let's first understand why there is so much buzz about Boyhood. We adults always have a special knack of liking coming-of- age movies as there is a scope of rejoicing our own memories,scope of rejuvenating ourselves. Boyhood,though typically American in nature and spirit,wonderfully constructs confusion,dilemma and traumatic nature of the age which is perhaps relevant in all parts of the world. It was certainly a mammoth task to maintain the same cast for such a long period of time and yo frame the change in their physical appearances. It definitely needs to be applauded. The film is soothing for eyes with its beautiful close-ups and some picturesque long-shots. Boyhood is garlanded with the performances of Patricia Arquette,Lorelel Linklater. Ethan Hawke was splendid as always. Everything seems so perfect but one thing. While the director was so much busy jotting the whole time period within the frame of 2 hrs and 43 minutes and the audience were awestruck at the magnitude of director's effort,are we given enough scope to empathize with Mason,Samantha or even Olivia Evans;did we get to know the insight of the characters? I dare say NO. In a third person narrative intimate details had to be provided to understand the transition of a boy into a hobbledehoy to maturity. But what we actually have is a passer-by's view of a fallen apart family. Linklater has failed in producing emotional responses out of Mason. Elements of social,political and sexual changes have been incorporated subtly,but it was not plausible enough to penetrate into Mason. That's why we don't know what he is feeling about his mother's series of failed relationships,we don't understand how and when his behavioral changes occur;instead out of nowhere he has been presented with a hipster like attitude towards life. As a result we remain dazed and confused such as the character. And this very thing brings me back to the half-circle I've drawn in the beginning- until and unless scope is provided for rendition of the central character,how are we supposed to acknowledge it to be a master- piece? Boyhood is a pretty watchable movie,more than a watchable movie i reckon but definitely does not belong to the league of other classics. In my estimation,Boyhood aims to be poetry but in the end cannot even surpass the realm of a bildungsroman."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,8/10,"It started slow and just took all of us in its charm. wonderfully sorted and beautifully synced over years and we start loving it the moment it starts and till the moment it ends. One of the best movies ever watched... Acting was superb, filming was outstanding and caste was so special. it was looking like teamwork, everyone just put up to there best. Its sort of movie which everyone will like and appreciate and start loving . There will be hardly any place when anyone will be feeling bore or will try to stop. you will definitely love it to all and every moment. It is indeed one of the loveliest movies i ever had. will be looking forward to next part of it containing his life ahead from his age from 18 to 30 or more and more. It is indeed one of the first movie i have ever watched in one go and i have wrote a review otherwise i never ever wrote a review before because this has inspired me a lot and just took my heart with it."
BOYHOOD,28 July 2014,10/10,"The reviews here are, as I expected, polarized. My experience was that as the film ended a small portion of the film goers seemed like they couldn't wait to get out of the theater. The larger portion, however, were either clapping or wiping away the tears. I joined the majority, clapping and dabbing.This film is not for everyone. There is no discernible narrative arc (conflict, inciting moment, climax, etc...). If anything it's all expository. This is a film about the passage of time and how we deal with it. If you are raising or have raised children, this film is for you. If you have a personal anecdote that starts with ""Thirty years ago..."", this film is for you. Enjoying this film is not reliant on being snooty or pretentious, but you have to have significant wear on the treads.If you're reading this with your ear buds ever so handy pop them in, stay home, sit back, and crank up the latest auto-tuned pop song, and let the ""olds"" enjoy this one."
BOYHOOD,9 July 2020,1/10,"There are bits and pieces of drama here and there but it's surprisingly not relevant to the story. The movie follows a kid while growing up but that's it. There is no journey, there are no lessons learned, there is no character development.The movie doesn't make you feel anything but frustration because it's almost 3 hours long.I'm sorry to say but this one is a completely wasted opportunity."
BOYHOOD,7 November 2014,1/10,"Looking the reviews, I thought it was worth a watch. The 1st hour was not too bad - highlights of the usual family problems in American culture etc - but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing. While the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique, there wasn't much of a plot other than ""this is what it's like in real life"" (in which case, it would be a documentary but it was not.) There was a good introduction (in the 1st hour...I was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go), but not much build-up, no climax and no resolution. Pretty disappointing to what I thought might be a good story."
BOYHOOD,5 February 2015,1/10,"BOYHOOD: This is Richard Linklater's much talked about film that was actually shot over the course of twelve years chronicling the growth of his characters. Now let me get something straight before I proceed. My reviews are always based upon the finished product: what is presented on screen. I don't concern myself with what happened behind the scenes, what got left on the cutting room floor or how the film was made, I concern myself with the balance of style, substance and execution. Now with that in mind, let I remind you that this is a work of fiction written by Linklater himself, not a documentary chronicling the growth of actual people but rather the growth of the characters he wrote. Had this been a documentary, I might have allowed myself to be blindsided just a bit in which manner the film was made. But it's not a documentary so I will completely disregard the manner in which the film was made, that sort of thing does not play a part in my review. So what do we have left?, Honestly, not that much: two hours and forty five minutes of filler lightly sprinkled with brief moments of conflict with no resolution therefore no character growth. I mean this is a film about boyhood or at least one can assume that much given the film's title. But I will go on a little further to say this is a film chronicling a boy's ascension into manhood. A lot can happen during that time. In fact a lot does happen during that period in one's life which all goes into the molding of the person who you will eventually be. Unfortunately, it seems that we're just outsiders looking in. You'd think that a film about one of the most tumultuous times in one's life would be a roller coaster ride of emotions. But what we have is a film that's nearly three hours long, devoid of any emotions, no life lessons learned by the main characters, no emotional growth, period. What the hell did I just watch? If the characters didn't learn anything, then they didn't grow emotionally. If they didn't grow emotionally, then I have a hard time connecting to the characters on an emotional level. Sure we can all relate to adolescence, but don't let that fool you into thinking that you know these particular characters. Know why they are the way they are. Know what drives and motivates their actions and behavior. By the end of the film, I've watched these human beings grow up physically rather than to grow into beings of consciousness and emotions that make them human."
BOYHOOD,30 November 2014,9/10,"Deeply moved by the delicate details of daily life throughout the movie, from the solitary moments in Mason's childhood to interactions between Mason and Samantha. It is these ordinary experiences that make what our life what it is now. Extremely relatable to practically every type of audience. Linklaters once said that he does not need drama but ordinary life is enough for him to make a movie. He has always been an expert in crafting the fine delicacy of human relationship and life in general since Before Sunrise. He is definitely one of my favourite directors of all time. Some believe that Boyhood would win him the Oscars this year, perhaps even for the Best Movie or Best Director. But it is highly doubtful whether the Academy would appreciate this delicacy and story of ordinary life as much as others do."
BOYHOOD,5 September 2014,5/10,"This movie deserves a lot of credit and praise for the manner in which it was filmed and made. The whole notion of sitting there and basically watching reality in fast-forward - that is, to see the same actor in different stages of his characters' life - is groundbreaking cinema. Furthermore - the acting was fantastic, and the story-line felt very real, you almost feel at times like you're not even watching a movie!That being said - I felt it was painfully long and even quite dull at times, and , at least in my opinion, it seemed to lack any real point to it. There was no true message behind it, and it lacked the cinematic spark I would require in order to actually give it a solid thumbs up in my book...All in all, I would definitely recommend either married couples (preferably with children, or more specifically teenagers), families, or , well, teenagers themselves - to go see this film. It fits the bill, you'll probably find it relatable, and it can even keep you cheerfully entertained at times.As for anyone else - it might just be a bit too weary and dull. Granted, the actor growing up on screen is, in itself, worth the cinematic experience for some. For me however, it wasn't enough to declare this a must-go."
BOYHOOD,12 August 2014,10/10,"Fantastic movie. Best of the year so far. If you were born in the 90's it will feel nostalgic as hell. There are memories in the movie that are mine too. The songs, the video games, the cartoons, more so because I come from a broken home too. It may speak a lot more to some people than others. For me it speaks to the heart, and that I cherish in this movie. Yes it's almost 3 hours long but it doesn't feel that long at all, it goes pretty fast actually.It is a fantastic work and I hope that will be considered by the Academy. I confess I've never seen the Before trilogy, but Richard Linklater deserves a nomination for best direction for this film.It doesn't reach the perfect score (only Godfather and Shawshank did it) for me but it is very close to it. 9/10. GREAT MOVIE, GO SEE IT!"
BOYHOOD,4 September 2014,10/10,"3 months ago i stumbled across this movie whilst looking at the ratings for 2014, after the agonizing wait i was able to watch it and 'boy' was it good, from the unique style of filming to the life lessons learned, the movie makes you reflect on life and realize how we are an ever-changing species, we may hit crossroads from time to time but ultimately life goes on, that seems to be the main message from the film, no-ones life is perfect and the focus on this boy's childhood conveys the experiences a lot of us would've gone through as kids. Certain moments struck me right to the core and made me realize how easily we take things for granted and how narrow-minded we can be. The film was executed in a way that just makes you smile, the music and the storyline go hand in hand to make this a true masterpiece, it makes me want to go and relive my childhood as i forgot how innocent and wonderful it was. if there's one thing i take from this, it's that ""life doesn't give you bumpers"" and most of the time you have to earn your stripes. would see this move again and again, if your looking for a movie that will make you appreciate life that much more, i don't think you'll find anything better."
BOYHOOD,28 January 2015,10/10,"When I read the most ""helpful"" review on the IMDb page of Boyhood, I decided that I just had to write a response to that. Because the movie isn't boring, long and slow at all... At least if you try to succumb yourself to this wonderful story of childhood, puberty and adulthood.I really wondered if, when I read the aforementioned most ""helpful"" review, the writer of that text was a man of fifty years or older who had totally forgotten what it was like to grow up. Because I am at the moment 21 years old, the whole story touched me. The scope is incredible, with many ordinary encounters throughout childhood (which keeps the narrative scope beautifully little, by the way), and Linklater giving a perfect representation of how it is like to grow up in the modern age of the 21st century. The random cultural references included are great to remark and hear, and many of the characters are just so warm (except, of course, for the second husband of Mason's mom).Though I'm from the Netherlands, the way Mason grew up resembles my own childhood. It was not as troubled as his, but still bears many traces of it. Just to see how one becomes less childish, more outspoken and more world-wise is beautiful, but touching. Throughout the whole film, I felt melancholy, and for everyone who wants a beautiful told, well acted and brilliantly directed look back at his own childhood: watch this movie, it will be one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences you will ever see."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,10/10,"It's strange, in the last few years whenever I've watched a movie I've been counting the minutes, even if I'm enjoying it has seemed like a task too some extent and I was aware of it ,Boyhood was different.At the risk of sounded pretentious it seemed like it was a version of my own memories, Linklater obviously played on this whether intentional or not, it was there. he manages to tap into your own life and make this film seem like you are the only person who is ever going to see this movie and its all for you which is am amazing feat! I'm not sure whether I've ever felt this way about a film before I found myself coming to tears at points which weren't even sad parts,the whole thing seemed like I was living out a life, a strange and abstract version of my own, even though the story of my life is a million miles away from mason's.I cant recommend this film enough the runtime just breezed by and I didn't want it to end I felt like I could have watched mason's story for another 12 years.Simply breathtaking, one of the greatest achievements in cinema."
BOYHOOD,18 September 2014,4/10,"I was really excited when I first heard about this movie. I thought ""wow, it's been shot for 12 years, no one ever did anything like that..."", and than watched it. Well i don't say it was the most boring movie of my life, but it's very close. The idea of shooting a film for several years with the same cast is just brilliant and puts a strong base to the movie. But than if you add amateur (sometimes very bad) actors, with an annoying lead character of some kind, and forget to put in any actual plot, it turns out to be the worst idea ever. Well of course it's understandable that with a low budget and the time of the shooting they couldn't afford Oscar-winners, but hey there's plenty of talented amateur actors in that sea I suppose. Ellar Coltrane either is the best actor I've ever seen or (most possibly) just simply have no idea what acting is... And gosh the way he speaks in his teenage years just makes you wanna punch him (seriously). Patricia Arquette, and especially Ethan Hawke however were the only ones whom acting was accountable and had character development. The brilliance of the 12-year-long shooting idea is also what makes it a bad movie. It's simply impossible to make a good film when you try to convert the happening of 12 YEARS into 3 HOURS, there's no atmosphere, you actually don't get to know the characters though you they grow up in front of your eyes. There's no personality to the movie."
BOYHOOD,26 January 2015,3/10,"I guess I just cannot relate to this kid. There were only a few moments, that touched me. All the rest was boring. After watching this movie I don't have any feelings - no desire to be better, to get the best of life, no gloomy thoughts on life. So for me the movie seemed pointless. Although I can see how for many people it would be their real life. I guess just not my case. So if you want to see a quick recap of a boring and tough life of a kid growing up, then you should see that movie. But there's not even ups and downs of his life - it just kinda flows it's ways and that's it. And the ending... well I guess it leaves you a way to decide for yourself what the ending will be"
BOYHOOD,15 February 2015,1/10,"The fact that this awful travesty of cinematography is so highly rated just lowered my opinion of humanity. It's downright boring and about as original as a Rocky Sequel or a Disney princess cartoon. Watching the characters in this film grow through adolescence was painful and I terminated the movie with extreme prejudice after a little over an hour. Thanks Richard Linklater for showing us what 95% of American boys experienced either directly or indirectly while growing up in the 90's. You managed to create a movie that made my formative years seem boring, tedious, and frighteningly more deserving of an Oprah episode than the ESPN 2 stuntman series I was hoping for. I fell asleep no less than five time during this flick and that's a very conservative number."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,5/10,I'm giving this movie a 5 because the idea of filming over so many years was brilliant. It started off OK but as it went on nothing exciting or gripping happened.I was so excited for this film and it had the potential to really connect with the viewers and feel what the characters where feeling which it did not.The story went nowhere it dragged out and also I felt like a lot of it didn't make sense.I tried my hardest to keep an open mind the whole way though out the film but when it ended all I could take from it was that they all grew older and nothing out of the ordinary happened. Al thought his boss creep-ed me out and had no reason to be in it.
BOYHOOD,3 December 2014,10/10,"It's 4:00 in the morning, and I just saw that almost three hours long movie, but yet there was not a single moment of sleepy like it would come with other movies. That is the greatest story ever made. The true life, so much ordinary things that it becomes no-ordinary film whit lot's of energy, enthusiasm. I got that feeling like; falling in love, or being on the most beautiful place you ever seen. It forces you to think a lot....... ............. .......... .......... .......... ........ ........... ..... .... ....... ............ ...... .......... ...... ......... ......... ........... ......... ........... ...... ......... ....... ....... ......... .......... ........... ...........I could probably wrote much more, but than no one would start to read :). PS: sorry for my English"
BOYHOOD,4 September 2014,10/10,"This film is a perfect representation of life as a boy growing up in this generation that no other film I've seen has been able to capture. Being the same age as the main character, it truly hits home on all the positions and ideals of life that I have gone through. Linklater never disappoints when it comes to coming of age movies. Ever since i saw Dazed and Confused as a child I have been in love with everything he does. His views on life match up perfectly with where I'm at and where I've been for a long time. I'm in love with this movie and even though I previously gave no thought to Ethan Hawke being a great actor I can say that this movie has changed my opposition. His role as the father in this is perfect. My family has never been open and close knit, we usually spend our time away from each other hiding in our rooms avoiding confrontation and conversation. I wish I could have a family this great, even through the troubles that they face they still manage to give me a warm, homie feeling. 10/10 Linklater keep making masterpieces."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,5/10,"I had such high hopes for this movie - from the super cool concept to the awesome acting to the talented writer and director. Maybe my hopes were TOO high, but it left me feeling disappointed.It's true that it is an accurate picture of life / but I didn't come away with any new insights or ""aha"" moments that I expect from art and entertainment. I think good movies teach us something or show us another perspective or even reassure us that everything is alright and I didn't get any of those feelings from this film.I, too, grew up during this era so I can vouch that the dialog and pop culture references were spot on . . . but if we want movies to be exactly like real life (without much drama or intensity or emotion) then we might as well spend our time living and staying focused on ""real life"" instead of sitting in theaters (or spending well over two hours at home) watching them.Even though lot of ""wisdom"" was offered to Mason, it is not clear that any of the messages made it through to him at the end and that is a disappointment. I don't see the character of Mason really growing in any noteworthy and appreciable way (other than the standard maturing into a young adult.) And again - if mirroring real life exactly was the point - then I'm not sure what Linkletter's motivation really was (what did he want audience's to FEEL and to TAKE AWAY from this flick?) My best guess is that he wanted a slice of the American public to see it and identify with it and say: ""Yes, I recognize my story here. That's familiar and that's cool to see it on the big screen and to have it validated."" But is that a ""big enough"" goal for a major motion picture that took over 12 years to make? I'm just not sold. . . VERY COOL CONCEPT but don't get your hopes up too high. . ."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,10/10,"I went into this movie expecting it to simply be another one of those over-hyped Oscar movies, but I was SO wrong. This was one of the most beautiful and brilliant movies I have ever seen. The acting by everyone, especially Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltraine, is amazing. This movie will not blow you away with amazing special effects or lighting, but that is not the point of the movie. The point of this movie is to tell the story of a child through the 12 most awkward and difficult years of his life in a way that so many people can relate to. It is also incredibly honest in how it portrays life. Not everything has a happy ending and many times you are left feeling unsatisfied with what just happened because it does not follow a basic ""movie formula."" This isn't a bad thing however because once the movie ends you realize how all of these tough events fall into place to allow this young man to become his own person and to find himself after searching for so long. This movie deserves the Oscar for best picture, director, and supporting actress. There are not enough words to describe how beautiful and honest this film is. Truly a masterpiece."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2015,8/10,This kind of movie is made once in a lifetime . The concept is so beautiful that it will take your breath away . Some performances are exceptional. The transition seems so natural . This is a must watch movie but at the same time it has become a bit over-hyped .Ethan Hawke has given a standout performance and Patricia Arquette has given some fine scenes . The end of the movie leaves you with a feel good factor and you would definitely want to watch what happens next in the life of Mason.Kudos to the director for thinking of such a novel concept and sticking to it for 12 years to provide us with a masterpiece .Thumbs up to the cast and crew for such a brave attempt.
BOYHOOD,16 September 2014,2/10,"Sorry I wasn't impressed. The only thing that was interesting about this film was his aging knowing it was real. The story line was slow, labored and boring. At times to attempted to be political.. making references to various liked and disliked politicians (mostly in a derogatory form). I judge movies on how they make you think or feel. The good ones linger and leave you reliving the story or imagining it differently. This movie only made me think about how much time I just wasted! I found nothing redeeming or valuable in the jumping around. When it was at the end all I could think is great now I can get on with the rest of my day."
BOYHOOD,28 June 2015,1/10,"No character arcs, no connection with the audience from the actors, no conflict. A travesty of a movie. Most over rated movie I have watched. No actor stood out. Ending was atrocious, like i expected. Just another over rated coming of age movie lacking in serious conflict. The casting was brutal. The cinematography was good, though does not make up for this abysmal story, which to me appears to be about nothing. Do not waste your time watching this.PS this is 1st review i wrote that's how bad i believe it to be""Boyhood: Richard Linklater's Boyhood is a coming-of-age drama that the director spent twelve years making. He cast a young boy, Ellar Coltrane, and shot the film a few days at a time for over a decade so that he could capture how his leading actor, and the rest of his cast, aged. The film's story simply follows a boy named Mason (Coltrane) as he progresses from age 6 to 18 and deals with the typical travails of childhood like his parents' divorce, bad stepparents, falling in love, finding his artistic voice, and fighting with his bratt"""
BOYHOOD,8 February 2015,5/10,"I was incredibly excited to watch this film, as the general concept was fascinating to me. I believe that it was an intelligent and fun idea that was made tiresome by the tedium of attempting to constantly try and teach the audience about something. The acting is occasionally outstanding, but the child actors peaked early and became less entertaining as the film progressed. The characters lacked depth, and I honestly believe that the kids in Harry Potter grew up on camera in a more realistic way than the actors in Boyhood. On the plus side, Linklater does a masterful job with the production, managing to maintain control over something for longer than most people have jobs. While not a terrible movie, I was incredibly disappointed with the outcome of such an ambitious and over-hyped film making attempt."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,7/10,only thing great about this movies is that it took 25years to film it take that out. nothing special left.kinda waste of time if you think about it.the movie itself was able to portray realistic life of an average kid from boy to an young adult but that was only because shi2t took 25years to film it!every other director with the funding and budget would have made this film.plus that kid acting was terrible. sounded like dude was high from beginning to end.
BOYHOOD,25 July 2014,10/10,"This movie touched me deeply. As a 19 year old, the same age as Mason, played by Ellar Coltane, the boy we watched grow and mature over 12 years, the film resonated with me more than any ever has. The young Mason's journey to tentative adulthood was so touching and simple but undeniably unique. The masterful dialogue perfectly captured Mason's changing surrounding environment but also we saw him change, such an introspective and personal experience, it was as if my own life flashed by in this three hour epic. There were no bells and whistles, overt clichés or obvious preaching. I think there is truly something in this movie that brought everyone back to their childhood, bonding all the viewers by this truly human experience. Familial bonds were tried, the self importance of first love felt, but the process of self discovery is the most important in this film and Mason was the hero, he grew into himself in a way that was captured so effortlessly. The cultural relevance's were just as important to me as Mason's transformations. Each new fad or technology represented the changes in my own life, brought memories of all my old friends my own upbringing. And the music was perfect, each Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend, WIlco song was impeccably timed, evoking just the right mix of melancholy and fondness.I know that this will be a film that will bring a gentle sentimentality of my youth, adolescence and eventual adulthood. I'm just glad something so special was made to revisit my life in such a palpable, pure way."
BOYHOOD,19 December 2014,6/10,"If looking for a laugh, action or adventure, this is not your movie. This is kinda like reading someones biograph, ""I was small, i got bigger, I grew up"". I expected more from this film. Especially with those ratings. Sure, there was good scenes and some good acting, but I was kinda hoping for something more. Something that would have either made me cry or smile. Now nothing happened. The fact that they filmed for 12 years got some points from me, its nice when the characters are the same trough out the movie. On the other hand the lacking of emotions and character kind of made me hope for different actors at some point. The actor playing Mason did an OK job. Yes, he was emotionally distant, but every teenage boy is that way. At least the ones I know. They don't really chatter away with parents or teachers. So I figure he was fit for his role.In conclusion, its a fairly good movie if you like basic story telling films. I found it weird. I gave it a 6, just because I was happy I made it trough it. And I'm left to wonder, what difference did this movie make? For me, or anyone?"
BOYHOOD,27 July 2014,10/10,"My mom and I just watched this movie today. It is one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. Since it took 12 years in the making, the characters literally age as the story progresses: stemming from early childhood, to adolescence, to high school graduation. This is one of those movies that could only be done once with the right actors, writing, directing, and time period to pull it off, and it achieved just that. From a personal stand point, it was kind of refreshing seeing the events of 2002-2014 (basically around my generation) being played out, while keeping the focus of the characters themselves. This movie does not hide anything or give any attempt to sugar-coat what people go through in life. There isn't one aspect of this film that didn't feel fake or out of place, it showed what it needed to show. When it came to abusive relationships, experimenting sexual desires, even childhood angst, the characters have real conversations that other parents use to talk to their kids. No matter what age the kids were in, no subject was too taboo to talk about when it came to each stage of growth and development.Writer/Director Richard Linklater is known for taking seeming mundane conversations and giving them meaning through character interaction. In his previous films, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Before Sunset"" (2004), and ""Before Midnight"" (2013), Linklater has two of the same characters, played by Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy, interact with each other as they stroll around Europe. The first film shows them meeting for the first time and taking advantage of the day to spend time with one another as they talk about their lives. The second movie has them meet up years later in a different location, with two separate lives and relationships. This movie took that concept of the ""Before"" trilogy and took a ""Truman Show""-like approach where you watch the characters age through their everyday lives.This film has used the same actors, and literally watch them age as they experience new things. There's no need for other actors playing older roles in this. The young actor, Ellar Coltrane, especially goes through the waves of time as he discovers new things as he shapes into an adult. It feels gratifying to know that this actor won't go through the Miley Cyrus approach knowing that he spent his time aging through a film instead of growing up keeping the title as a kid performer. He spent his time as a kid, and is now a young adult as he looks back on this movie.I've been waiting for a movie like this to arrive for quite some time, not in the way I would have expected, but a pleasant experience none the less. It is definitely a breakthrough achievement in film making, and I hope it continues to surprise us viewers in the years to come."
BOYHOOD,4 February 2015,1/10,"The most stupid film I've ever seen. Surely the day i'll be sick i know i'll regret the precious hours i've spent watching this movie, so now i feel i've the duty to advise other IMDb people not to lose their life this way - Michelangelo created the Sistine chapel in 4 years, and then 12 years to assemble this thing!? could have written a better screenplay and chosen better settings in 12 years of work! The characters are hateful(aside from the Hispanic plumber), especially the young protagonist, one of those guys that feel special, an unappreciated snowflake, even if it's just a moronic adolescent.There is not a single dialog, not a single scene that make your neurons bump, it's just a tedious and endless movie in which nothing happens."
BOYHOOD,19 January 2015,3/10,"Just by looking at the title and the description I was not triggered to watch this movie, but by seeing its rating (an 8.3) I was curious what would make this movie so great. I therefore made the mistake of watching this movie. Seriously, how can people give this a good mark, let alone a ten?!The title 'Boyhood' and the description 'The life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18.' simply are spot on. The maker of this movie did an excellent job in describing the life of a boy.The result is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my whole life. There's no drama, no happiness, no sadness, nothing inspirational and nothing to empathize with. In short: there's no story, just the life of a boy, which also is a very common one. This movie is like a biography, except that it's not real. I already have my own life for that and if that's not enough, there's always facebook to watch other peoples lifes. Apart from this movie being extremely boring, I think the cast is OK and the actors did quite a good job.As you may notice, the reviews are very divided, so it seems there are two types of people: those who adore this movie and those who really dislike this movie (there doesn't seem to be an in-between). Here's my simple advice/conclusion: if the title and description are not appealing to you, then don't waste your time.Otherwise, you'll probably not share my opinion and this movie might be something for you."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2014,8/10,"Something that stands out automatically in this movie is the unforced acting and natural character development. Even the child actors take their part very seriously and don't overact or feel awkward around stars like Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. Everything flows perfectly and even though you get to experiment and feel the passing of time, you won't get lost jumping through it thanks to the good music choice and timely conversations.It's truly amazing to see how much a person changes under the weight of time, every person that comes in contact with the main character will contribute to his evolution. We are definitely the result of every encounter and experience we had until the present day and this movie exposes this idea and makes you think about your own life and why you are the way you are.It is a well-rounded piece of work and hides it's substance in order not to hold your hand. Deserves a second watch."
BOYHOOD,13 October 2015,3/10,"When I watched this movie I could not believe how tedious I thought the entire experience was. My initial thought when I heard about this movie was: Wow 12 years in the making, that sounds amazing! But when I saw the movie i realized that the whole ""12 years in making"" thing is nothing but a gimmick, and the movie itself is utterly without any sort of substance, there is no plot! People have argued this with me before and said, well it is not the kind of film that has a structure, it is more unique than all of this films that follow the same formula. Well i disagree because it is a scripted film, so why could not there have been things like a plot, character development, an actual goal for the main character? I would honestly find the movie way more compelling if it was an actual non-scripted flick. Because that would allow the viewers to get an actual glimpse of what it is like growing up, well maybe, I am sure it would be more fun to watch than this. Imagine shooting a film with a script that actually had a story to tell, with equally long production time as this flick. Would not that have been awesome? Instead we have this mess of movie, that has nothing except for its gimmick."
BOYHOOD,8 November 2015,1/10,"Pointing a camera at professional and amateur actors for a few days each year for 12 years gets 10 out of 10 for commitment and consistency, but that doesn't make it art.It's not art to come up with clichéd, hackneyed characters (the useless dads and steps dads, the mum who makes bad choices of partners, the sulky teenager)then have them improvise stilted lines. At most this is a piece of unremarkable improvisation based on a skeletal plot. The actors somehow lack the wit or authenticity to make this work.I don't mind the plotlessness of it, I explored art + philosophy as a student and 'get' the idea of avoiding the grand narrative, or the 'Hero's journey' where we're given a repeated conflict/character-development plot arc and so on. I'm all for resisting the clichés and for confounding our expectation of a fairy tale resolution with tidy endings that appeal to our ego and desire for reassurance But even as someone who feels there's often much to feel disappointed about in life, I found these characters pointless and unremarkable. Was that the point? - That in this world there exist tedious people who don't make the most of life despite opportunities? I can see I'm not alone here in feeling irritated at the self indulgence of this film. It's joyless and seems determined to tell us that people, or life, can be unremarkable.Is it a critique on middle class complacency? Yeah, well, it exists - does this film change that? It seems from reading the positive reviews that it had the opposite effect 'just like life' people say. Thank god my life has been nothing like this1 This could make me feel pretty bloody remarkable, but I expect a 'great' film to be more than an ego stroke.Beckett, Bunuel, Bret Easton Ellis - these artists deliver an existentialist message in unique ways. It's been done, far far better before and will be again. Brilliant artists make the ordinary extraordinary, it seems this film did that for some, I'm happy for them, but there's better work out there."
BOYHOOD,21 August 2014,8/10,"This movie is far from the average movie. Some would argue this was a glorified home video, which is an acceptable argument. It does not take the usual path of entertainment and movie magic; instead, it goes down a whole different avenue of filmmaking, one that touched the heart of mine and hopefully will touch yours too. I can see why a good portion of people would find this movie ""boring"" with little to no entertainment value, purpose or reason...and you'd be right. It's not the thickening plot or the suspenseful moments that make this movie one to watch, but rather it's the way the story stays so true to life that makes it engaging and a true cinematic masterpiece. I found myself forgetting I was watching a movie and more like watching a reality. But this movie is far from honey boo boo, it's just the right amount of humanity that gives it its flair. The characters are REAL and the events told are relatable. The dialogue is great and give the characters life and overall teaches a lesson. For those who don't believe there is something to learn from this movie, than maybe you missed the point of it all. The movie is left open-ended because life is open-ended it's up to interpretation. So if you think the movie is bland and hallow, then maybe it's because that's how you see life, a boring path of events that is to little or no avail. And that's okay, not everyone will interpret it the same way. All that aside, Boyhood does (whether you want to believe it or not) what no movie has done before and does so in a spectacular, beautiful, and realistic manner and that's what makes Boyhood a masterpiece."
BOYHOOD,4 October 2014,10/10,"I watched the movie with my 13y old boy who usually is into action movies. During the movie I could see from his body language how much the film appealed to him. His feedback was 'This is a very good film. If it would have been any shorter something would have been missing.'. I agree with him - the movie was great. It shows real people in real life - it shows humanity. It reminded me in a way of the movie 'Heimat', a well made trilogy about German history between 1919 and 2000. Again, very personal and full of humanity. I can understand that this might not be entertaining to all people but it certainly was to us. Enjoyed it and I hope it can get an Oscar."
BOYHOOD,31 December 2014,9/10,"Before watching this movie, I wasn't sure if the plot would interest me since the movie seemed to be just about an ordinary kid's life and the only interesting thing about the movie seemed to be the fact that it was made over 12 years and followed the actual aging process of the actors. After seeing the movie, I realized that I was completely wrong. Boyhood is more an experience than just some other conventional movie. Seeing the protagonist and his family growing up and changing constantly during the movie makes the viewer think about family life in all its aspects and when, at the end, Mason leaves his home, dem feels kick in... The fact that the movie itself was written over 12 years also brings something special to the movie."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,4/10,"Too many times, I think someone will fall in love with the idea of a film, the premise and the functions of the actors and shots inside of it. All of those things can create a wonderful package for a story to sit inside. Those things do form a wonderful package in ""Boyhood"" the premise of the film is no doubt groundbreaking. Maintaining a cohesive cast for over a decade is barely something our favorite animated series can do...much less an independent film. From the set visuals to the lighting to the composition of shots everything in this film is very well done and a testament to those who worked so very hard on it.I know you're expecting a ""but"" and here it is..the process of growing up and learning, having difficulties and struggles and the occasional trite and annoying unsolicited motivational speech from an overbearing teacher or alcoholic is annoying. All of those things are annoying and come across on the screen. Not just crashing this down here to say that it's ""Too long"" but there were several moments in this movie where I'd pause to look at the status bar just to see how much longer I have to go...but there was a very tedious nature to everything that made me want to see something else from Mason towards the end. Some growth to at least let us know that he's leaving boyhood to become a man. The closing sequence came close to that...but It was just far too little too late.I say this to go back to the packaging idea...Ethan Hawke is great in this film, as is Patricia Arquette. There's just really not very much story in here. I get the premise and understand it but I'd prefer a movie take me away to experience something else, not just take me back over and over again to a place i've already been.Instead of some transformation by Mason at the end... his mother becomes me by the end of the movie...Tired and burned out and really just over the entire process. She looks up from her papers with tears in her eyes and says to Mason""I just thought there would be more"" Yeah, me too."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,5/10,"On what sense does this movie has a 8.3 score on IMDb?? I am truly amazed. 2 hours and 45 minutes of single line story. No cinematic turns or flares. More likely to win an Oscar in Documentary category. I started the movie with lot of expectations and all those went in vein within one hour. Despite that I thought there might be something and keep my nerve calm for ending. But alas!!! What an waste of time.. In the poster, someone summarized is as ""A moving 12 year epic"". Ha ha ha.... 12 years epic boredom it must say. Even writing a review on the movie is boring as I must have to submit at least 10 lines on this thing. What a disaster!"
BOYHOOD,10 April 2015,4/10,"I watched boy hood the other day and all I can say is that to me its the most overrated film I have seen yet. a 3 hour film with barely a story line, no thank you! All I can say is that the only reason critics gave this a whopping 100 review is that the critics were too in love with the fact that the production filmed this film for 12 years using the same people. yes the idea of seeing a person grow up from a child to a young adult in 3 hours is a good idea but I would like to see some what of a story line. In my opinion the life of the child's mother was far more enjoyable and exciting than the boy that the actual film was based on. sorry but I'm giving it a 4/10, and thats being generous."
BOYHOOD,31 October 2015,8/10,"I just like how genuine the characters seem. They portray a family's life with no unnecessary excitement or boom. It's shown how it is mostly and therefore feels original. The movie doesn't feel the need to make up something totally unusual to sell. Most of movies in this time have these unbelievable stories, therefore this movie is pretty distinctive. The dialogs between the characters, is very well thought of. They take their time and listen to one another. Another point which was quite amazing was portraying the characters in a neutral way. As a spectator I could make connection to characters without prejudgment. There is a communication and not a monologue. I really liked it. Hope to see more movies with this director and writers."
BOYHOOD,4 December 2021,1/10,"Mason is the most boring person ever. A total cliché, waste of time. He just mumbled and grunt the whole time. Dude barely says something interesting."
BOYHOOD,4 October 2014,1/10,"Don't fool yourself, it's just bad. Don't watch it. You may thank me for this advice. I wanted to keep this comment short, because I don't want to spend more time of my life for this movie, almost three hours was enough. On the other side, the movie made me feel better about myself in some way. I mean some people spent 12 years making this (what a waste). This was refreshing, because they lost more of their life than me. This long production time doesn't show itself in the quality. I had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality. They used the style of bad propaganda movies, typical suburban shots where you expect, that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children. Of course it would be explained too why it is bad, like everything else in this movie, they put the words in your mouth, leaving NOTHING for the imagination. I don't even mention that the main ""character"" is not special at all, even more boring than an average person. Oh, and he makes bad quality photos too (in this bad quality movie), living the life of an artist in a movie, which never heard of art (and he leaves his picture in the developer for ""waaay"" to long, listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead). You will find all kinds of schemes and clichés in this ""piece of modern film history"" (as they call it.), in this movie, which doesn't dare to state anything (The whole movie was like a 3 hours long ""idk""). Showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming white-trash, is pro-marijuana (I guess), but only daring to show it for a split of a second. I watched every second of this movie, just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? With a highly unrealistic chick (acting like a date-raper) sitting with our high (placebo-mescaline) main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film: I don't know."
BOYHOOD,9 July 2018,10/10,"I have never related more to a movie in my entire life and that might be why I adore Boyhood. Richard Linklater used the same actors over the span of twelve years to make this movie and it is not just a gimmick. He captures small things that we tend to forget about while growing up, or, for adults, watching your kids grow up. Sometimes the child acting is rough around the edges but Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are spot on and phenomenal. If someone else didn't care for this movie because it didn't touch them, I could even understand why, but this movie pounds through a very profound message. Our lives are all made up merely of moments that fall on top of one another. Sometimes you don't feel as you expect to in each moment, but at the end of it all, all these little moments add up to a life and reflecting on it all can be quite daunting. A lot of the deep messages come straight out of the mouths of the boy, Mason, and other side characters. This can be interpreted as bad writing, but when I look back to not so long ago when I was his age, I can see the similarities in our thinking. He talks like a lot of teens do and watching him makes you think about your own past and present angsty moments. Linklater specializes in films that portray realistic characters with realistic dialogue in realistic situations. This allows the audience to emotionally connect with his films. Boyhood is something special because there is at least one character for everyone that they can identify with. The movie is 2 hours 45 minutes but it flies by just like life does. This movie is nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the 2000s and is touching in so many ways. Boyhood is a modern classic."
BOYHOOD,19 December 2016,6/10,"I expected more from this movie than I got, based on the build up it got in the press. Were it not for the gimmick of using the same actors filming over several years, this film would be completely unremarkable amongst many other 'coming of age' tales. It might have benefited from being a good hour shorter.The acting was good enough, but the story itself seemed rather disjointed and in the end, pointless, unless the pointlessness of life could be seen to be the point of the story. Part of the problem was that none of the characters, including the central boy, spoke to me. I never really cared what happened to any of them and my only thought regarding the future of the story was to hope it would soon be over."
BOYHOOD,30 July 2018,3/10,"Spending 12 years making something doesn't absolve you of the basic requirements of story and plot. Essentially, it provides you with more time to rewrite your script. A completely boring, cliche story, whose only redeeming aspect - and the reason everyone is raving - is because it took so long to make. Which is never a good reason to like anythin."
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,10/10,"As a cinephile I am always willing to watch anything, and when this film was recommended to me I was like ""Why not?"". So after I finally saw it I was in shock. This film is a masterpiece, it is put together so beautifully and acted out perfectly. The reality aspect is actually true to life. It's portrayal of life through a young boys eyes is spot on! Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette absolutely blew me away and the other actors were amazing as well! The experience is unlike any other and the movie has had me thinking about actually growing up and how I see it. Ever since I saw this film I've been bragging to my friends about it and I've even given it the top spot on my favorite films of all time! So just go see it and see for yourself!"
BOYHOOD,24 December 2014,1/10,"Hated it. Most boring film of the year. Could've followed someone a bit interesting for ten years, rather than this boring tripe. Sit around the kitchen table, go to school, kitchen table, school, father in law gets drunk, school, table etc etc. You get the idea. That's it in a nutshell. Sorry for all the spoilers, but Turkey of the year for me, do not understand how so many people like it. Probably many boring people relate to it. Hope it doesn't win any Oscars, there are many other films more worthy, just because this is a unique film doesn't make it a good one. Acting is terrible, and there is no plot, obviously. It's just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced. But are still friends. But I'm struggling to see the story here, surely if you are going to do something as clever as is, at least make it worthwhile. Most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident, this kid doesn't. Nowt. Didn't even have a personality......."
BOYHOOD,20 November 2014,8/10,"Boyhood. The age old story of maturity told like never before. A beautiful and special experience, the nostalgic equivalent of a photo album. The movie excels in character development by having no specific plot or destiny for its characters to fulfill. Mason is a boy we identify with, and one which recreates the experience of growing up like no one else. There is definitely going to be a lot of Oscar buzz around this one. And deservedly so. Boyhood is the most repeated story of growing up made in the most special way possible. Imagine a time capsule, one into which you deposit memories every year for a long time. That is exactly what this movie is about – a capsule of moments. This is a movie that has been in the making for twelve years, the story of a young boy (Mason) growing up, made with a running cast of actors who met every year to shoot parts of the movie. It is this unique technique of direction by Richard Linklater that elevates this movie from being every other story and that which makes it something special. When analyzed on the plot alone, there is no real plot. It is a montage of moments that pass, ever so constantly, before the eyes of a young boy all the way into adulthood, and the anthem of the film is just that – life is but a series of moments, where none really seem to matter at the time and we are always on the move to the next. Check out my detailed review at the wordpress blog ""davidandstan"". And possibly shoot me your thoughts on the film."
BOYHOOD,26 August 2014,9/10,"Possibly one of the best movies of the decade. The movie is so moving and it shows a realistic point of view of a boy from 6-18. Most amazingly is that it was filmed for over 12 years. It's incredible how the cast were that dedicated. The acting was very good. Ethan Hawke was the only known actor, and his performance was very good, however so was the whole cast. The acting from all of these unknown actors was incredible. I think the main message of this movie is that life is an incredible journey. Although life can be rewarding, you will always experience tough times, but you can always overcome them. Very good movie its a must watch."
BOYHOOD,9 June 2014,10/10,"In an interview Ethan Hawke (playing the protagonist's father) said that time has played a considerable role in several of Linklater's films (e.g. with the Before-films always taking place over the course of only one day every nine years). In a way Boyhood is about everything that happens in between the Before-films and the passing of time itself seems to stand at the core of this story even more than the boy Mason (portrayed by Ellar Coltrane) himself.This is a film about life. Involving everything that our lives involve: All the drama just as much as the habits, the boredom as well as the beauty. Although all the adult actors are excellent (particularly the different husbands of Mason's mother all delivered memorable performances), what is most impressive is to observe Ellar Coltrane and Richard Linklater's daughter Lorelei - brother and sister on screen- develop into talented young actors. Particularly Coltrane shows great depth without huge gestures and I hope we'll get to see a lot more of him in the future. I am about the same age as Coltrane is, so this was special to me also because of all the cultural references that I experienced first-hand growing up (from the posters, to the games, the books and most of all the beautiful soundtrack). Yes, this is also a film about America (and Texas and its peculiarities as a place to grow up in constitute a part of the experience), but the essence of the story could easily be transferred to another continent, simply because this is a film about childhood and the passing of time. Everyone will be able to identify with this in one way or another and I hope a lot of people will go and see this in spite of being an almost three-hour-long, at times pretty slow, low-budget film. There are only a few films you watch that you feel will stay with you for a long time. One of them- The Graduate- is referenced in Boyhood, whilst Boyhood is one that I can't wait to watch with my children in twenty years to show them what it meant to be a child in the beginning of the 21st century."
BOYHOOD,30 July 2014,9/10,"I was pretty skeptic before watching this movie because i thought it was one of those ""African American struggling childhood"" movies and i was wrong. I watched it on a movie festival so i didn't know Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette were acting in it and actually, it was about their son who happened to be white. I didn't know nothing. Of course, i have nothing against African American dramas. I love them very much, but i didn't want to watch another version of The Blind Side. And then i saw this masterpiece. Director really made an effort in creating this creative story about a boy and his growing up. He encounters on specific people in certain periods of his lifetime but he is constantly moving so he loses a touch with them. Both, those good ones and the bad ones. It is sad but it's also very true and realistic and it's perfect example of modern day drama. Frankly, i never heard about or saw the other actors except boy's parents, but yet again i was very surprised of their acting skills. All in all, i think it's extraordinary movie and it has a heart. You should definitely see it!"
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,3/10,"the only positive thing about the movie I could find was that it at least didn't try to create the American dream fiction ...But then.....at the end .... the minute he walks into his new school,just after being dumped by his girl,gets invited to some beautiful unreal nature event with ...... ... a nice girl .... what a disappointment after all !!i don't know what to write more about this movie but I have to finish few more lines in order to have it posted , so I just go on telling that it was such a disappointment and I do not understand why it has been so much awarded ????"
BOYHOOD,26 August 2014,4/10,"This has been one of the strangest movie experiences of my life.I've never seen anything like it; that is most likely the highest compliment I can give it, because I don't see much else worth applauding.It's difficult to tell what was trying to be achieved in this movie, even with the template being 'Life' and growing up. It's ironic ins a sense, because the style in which every story is filmed is completely lifeless and dull. I could have seen this film working very well as a - dare I say it - art house film, if it had focused more on individual ages, the mother, or even just had closeups of the boy and a few attempts to get into his head space. And by that I don't mean I want Tree of Life, I simply don't want the incessant, monotonous string I was left with.For a film that wanted to tell such an honest story about coming of age, it seemed to have a lot of clichés it should have tried to avoid. Bullying? Check, let's film one scene involving bullying and never mention it again. Religion? Check, let's film a redneck giving a sermon and be done with it. And let's not forget the nice guys the mother marries, who all turn out to be drunk and abusive five minutes later. It felt formulaic and repetitious, to say the least.And many will argue: that's what life is like, life is very straightforward like that. This statement has a lot of reason, but I have to ask myself, if Linklater pursued 'the truest movie about life ever made', and this is the best he could come up with, what was the point? I can't figure out if his ambition was really to make something that, from scene to scene, feels the same. There is no real change in the main character other than what is obvious: oh, he's a teen, now it's time for him to start drinking and smoking. Oh, he's graduating, time for his love life to be turbulent and be slightly nervous about college. I guess the grand achievement the director was attempting went to his head, because he focused on barely anything else.As for the whole '12 years' thing, I will express my respect. They took a risk with the decision to abandon re-shoots and go with this somewhat oblivious time line. I just wish it would have accumulated to something more meaningful and intimate than 'wow, 12 years, look at what we did!'.Although Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette did a good job, I don't see anything impressive about Boyhood other than the fact that they kind of made a string of short films work over the course of more than a decade. The kid was a dick, the music was shoved in your face so you understood what year it was, the screenplay lacked all effort.Boyhood is a science experiment with no outcome."
BOYHOOD,30 August 2018,10/10,"A brilliant idea, brilliantly executed. Simply a masterpiece. It makes me emotional to think about it. Now In late middle age, it allows me to look back, to get into my own quite different story and to inhabit being a boy again."
BOYHOOD,30 November 2014,9/10,"After reading just an intro to this movie, I wanted to watch it, just to see how well can they catch the grow-up process from boy to a young man. Honestly, it's an amazing movie depicting (terryfyingly) typical problems of today's kids, being brought up in pathologic families, where alcohol is present and where nothing is assured. The director had made an outstanding job, filming this over 12 years, and truthfully catches the characters, builds their personalities from one age to another, shows the problems, asks important questions, even giving intentionally wrong answers, so we see how wicked some things are. All in all, this movie should be watched by every father, to see how things can fail, and how things can go well."
BOYHOOD,15 December 2014,4/10,"I know this film is gaining wide acclaim this year and it is the front runner for best picture, but I don't understand all the love. The characters were annoying and rarely did anything interesting. The film seemed to have no driving conflict at all and I felt like I was watching a whole lot of nothing. The movie was not only boring but it was way too long!I understand that it is AMAZING that the film was made over 12 years. Yes I get that but the amazing concept, I feel, was unfortunately executed on an incredibly unworthy story.Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are gaining attention this award season but I really don't know why! I thought Ethan was fine but not great and Patricia's performance is laughably bad!This is just my opinion and yes, it is a very unpopular one. I just don't understand the love. I really wanted to like it, too. 4/10"
BOYHOOD,7 December 2014,8/10,"Boyhood, regardless of the known fact (and a too adulated thing, too, to be honest) that it was shot for 12 years, has been a wonderful ride, showing the very real transformation of Mason and his family, not just in the physical sense, but their emotional and social maturity. It showed their problems, their weaknesses, their temptations and so much more that it felt that we grew up with their decisions and their fate, and thus our bond with their characters seemed grew up stronger with 12 years of the film's time span.It was never boring. Well but i think the ending was. When he took off for college, I never considered the Mother's speech as climax (if that is it's intended purpose), and for the credits I never saw that coming. I could call it a disappointment, but as I look back at the whole movie, it was, after all, a pleasant coming-of-age film.I will not go to the hey-it-was-shot-every-week-for-12-year-and-it- got-100-on-metacritic-so-it-is-awesome bandwagon, though. The effort is outstanding, but I think the critics showed too much sympathy for this. But who am I to say?"
BOYHOOD,13 February 2016,1/10,"One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. I mean, what's the point of this.It made me angry that I wasted nearly 3 hours on this crap. According to me, Its rating on IMDb should be between 5 to 6. It seems to be a trend that well-formed characters are lauded as excellent movies, when in reality it takes more than characters to make a story that works.Boyhood spans 12 years and has vivid characters, yet it's hard to nail down what the movie is about. What is the conflict? What is the issue that must be resolved? Lack of conflict is no minor thing. It gives framework to a film and the viewer something for which to cheer. I never felt I had an outcome for which to cheer.I was not deeply moved. My heart was not touched. My Suggestion DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. Thanks"
BOYHOOD,5 August 2014,10/10,"The story is great, deep and funny, the characters are super- identifiable and they're played by great actors that we see growing up in live on the screen. The dialogues also are fresh and really truthful. Basically, I'd sum up the film as a poetic and honest slice of life.This movie is not only incredibly entertaining, it is also therapeutic. The story is such a great reflection of your life, whoever you are, that you can now consider it as an indispensable equipment for the rest of your life.Yep. The film has this kinda power that puts a ball in your throat at the end of the film, and you need to lean on something when you get out of the theater. I saw it at the SFIFF projection, and it brought up so many emotions at once that then when Richard Linklater came on the stage to answer some questions, it was the icing on the cake and I had an anxiety attack."
BOYHOOD,27 January 2021,4/10,"I think I would be embarrassed in any universe to write something like ""you told me I'm smart and to study and now I'm successful so you saved me"".
I really really disliked this movie, and not because of nothing happening, which was actually the only cool thing about it, like seeing their lives as a neighbor. But I don't understand how this movie which touches the american reality only superficially and includes pretentious dialogues and forced character development is supposed to be a masterpiece. Especially with all the potential it had."
BOYHOOD,10 December 2014,10/10,"Boyhood is really quite an accomplishment in my perspective. It's a bold and brilliant idea to shoot a film along the whole 12 years growth with the same group of actors, to show how the time actually seizes us. And Linklater did it awesomely well. This film is absolutely worth a nomination of Best Film of Oscar. There are many films showing a man's life from the juvenile days to a wedding or even a funeral. But most of them used different cast in each stage of life to represent the same character. And Linklater shoot this film in a manner of documentary therefore everything in Boyhood did change across time which we could easily noticed without a subtitle like A FEW YEARS LATER. What's more, I am about the age of Samantha so the transformation of the society is exactly what I've been experienced since my own childhood. The 911 happened when I was in Grade2 in elementary school. I had no idea what TERRIORTIST actually means. I couldn't even understand why the plane had to hit the skyscrapers with so many passenger on it. I still can't understand it today. And then we could see that Bush was out and Obama move into the White House. I still remember how thrilled the media was. All the headlines of the newspaper and breaking news on were nothing but Obama's campaign speech and Mitchell in Jason Wu's dress. Later on, Samantha and Mason and their siblings in law all had their cell phones, folded one like Motorola with real keyboard. But as the film's time going, Mason had Facetime with his father with the Iphone4. I mean, if you do have come all through these events, you will get some kind of resonance like HOW TIME FLIES or TIME AND TIDE WATI FOR NO MAN. And you know you have physically grown up like the characters in this films. This experience is like reviewing your life profile visually.Lately I've just read a book written by Sheryl Sandberg, the Lean in. after having watched Boyhood, I found Olivia, the MOTHER, was as excellent as Sheryl. She could have ruin everything or be ruined entirely since there were so many unpleasant things coming one after one. But she was so determined in the belief that she had to make their life better. I am not quite sure about the education situation in US, but it's almost impossible for a Chinese single mother with two young children needing to be fed to go back to school to acquire a higher education degree. The obstacles are external and internal. But Olivia, although lack of smart choice of husband, is a wonderful mother and professional woman. What else we could expect from a woman who successfully put two kid into colleges and have the career as she likes?I know it's not a good idea to talk about something personal publicly on the internet but Olivia did remind me of how hard my father had have tried to raise me up and gave me the best that he could afford as a single father with two failed marriages. Without his selfless devotion and greatest love of the world, a girl born in a small village hindered by mountains could never have the chance to write a film review in a foreign language (although still very rough in manner).Well yes, I talk too much here. But I do appreciate that Linklater have made such a wonderful film to warm my heart."
BOYHOOD,3 September 2019,9/10,This film does an excellent job illustrating how difficult it can be while becoming a teenager and young adult. This film will always hold a special place in my heart because it is very relatable in many aspects of life.
BOYHOOD,6 February 2015,1/10,"Boyhood is truly an amazing film. Terrible, awkward cringe-inducing dialogue. Boring, uninspired cinematografy. Awful, poorly written characters. No story to keep you interested. Also, don't forget that the movie's really long too. It almost feels twice the 12 YEARS.Let's be serious here. They are saying the movie's revolutionary. It took twelve years to make! But if you think about it, Harry Potter franchise is same kind of thing as this film except with actual characters and plot.But really... some people dare to call this movie a masterpiece? Hmm, I think I will release my childhood movies. They were recorded in span of 12 years. I'm pretty sure I'll get an Oscar.In the conclusion. Spare yourself your sanity and don't watch this film. I'm pretty sure that once you get outside of the cinema you will feel 12 years older. I got gray because of that movie."
BOYHOOD,19 November 2014,8/10,"Wow the 1st word came from my mouth after finishing this.story line- from age 5 to age 18 life of a kid.A film with almost common story of more or less every child in America in their grown up age. but its still not bore you for a single of moment,you will relive your boyhood in each scene.It is a must watch not only a film which filmed over more than 12 years with same cast,its because its simplicity. A must watch for not only young ones but for theirs parentsThis film make you travel in time to your boyhood,each person gone enjoy it in different ways.Last comment- Go for it,Buy it."
BOYHOOD,12 February 2015,10/10,"Richard Linklater definition of Life Epic movie, will be remembered forever a lot of hearts got touched because in a way...we felt what we couldn't feel again... childhood... and to see all difficulties in life was worth going through What mason been through is what millions others went through just seeing time fly by and things change for better or worse or even the same life is stages every stage is different... husbands,friends,even kids,and in very strange way life is beautifulWhat a movie..best movie of 2014 with no doubt,full of life,full of memories Masterpiece"
BOYHOOD,24 August 2014,5/10,"I should preface this comment by saying that I did not LOVE the movie. It was OK, kept my attention, but I don't believe it lives up to the hype at all.BUT.... what was up with Patricia Arquette's final scene?!? Yes, this mom made a lot of bad choices in the film, but with each bad choice, she made good-- went to college, left the abusive, alcoholic husbands. So why, on the verge of her son leaving for college, does Richard Linklater have her break down and have a seriously SELFISH rant in front of her son? Facing an empty nest is daunting, and I know it brings up tons of emotions for parents, but to cry to her son that her life is over is immature. I really feel like this rant was unrealistic given her strength and fortitude over the rest of the movie. I walked away feeling so annoyed for her and for Mason."
BOYHOOD,30 October 2019,6/10,"I can see the artistic aspect of the movie and each roles capture for this film. I mean it it's a great accomplishment, especially dealing with a cast for so long and particularly child actors. Other than that I guess that's about it, at least for me. Yeah you could say the fact that we are watching the life of these people pass throughout the years in a few hours it's amazing. But that aside, the story it's pretty ordinary, even boring. I cant even relate with any of the characters or circumstances brought up on this movie, and the sudden gaps make it look like an incomplete film, so its even worst for me as a viewer, since I cant get into the story. Ill say its just like watching one of those 10 year challenge facebook videos or sliding through someone social media nowadays. Which say a lot about all this project.
In the end I do recommend at least giving it a try and getting your own conclusions."
BOYHOOD,27 February 2015,3/10,"I tried to watch all the films nominated for the 2015 Oscar awards best picture. If I'm not mistaken this film was the 1st exit of all , not caught my attention and did not look up to know the nomination. This was the last of the 8 I looked and I really do not like it one little bit. It do not generate me anything, is a film that spends waiting to happen something central and resounding and yet nothing happens. Jumps in time although they are not marked are almost always immediately recognizable. Moreover the center love swings experienced by the mother that the child passage teenager. I'm always a little influenced by the scores see on IMDb and I think that's the reason why not abandoned by half. However, they are not all bad news. Is to recognize the fact that it was filmed over several years (12 if I am not mistaken ) and increasing age of the characters is clearly noted. Sorry if i had some English mistakes."
BOYHOOD,22 July 2015,9/10,"i used to be an Oscar nominated films fan. well not long enough though, maybe when i was in college around 17 years ago.. But a 12 years in the making film such this, how could i imagine something like Boyhood can possibly be made. It was literally presented the whole cast as they aged w/o spoiling the flow of the story. Wow!! I was thinking the transitions of characters should appear the traditional way of showing different kid to adolescent one, even the older casts. If it's not just a film, I can say they are genuinely related to each other as family themselves.. This just broke a certain record in movie industry, a major description that all involved in this film can survive the hell of 12 years to complete this and can only be played for more than 2 hours.. not bad.. I love the story.. Such typical American family story that anyone can relate into. Congratulations to the director first and foremost. You are such an amazing human being. To the casts brilliant!! I wonder how did you prepare yourselves to last this long before finally seeing the final product of your efforts. I've rooted for you in Oscars.."
BOYHOOD,4 August 2016,10/10,"This movie is an amalgam of what it means to grow up in a semi-stable, (sometimes) blended family, which hundreds of millions of U.S. children have now experienced. It is poignant watching the pain that flawed, selfish parents can inflict on the existence of their children. Watching Mason and Samantha cope with a cruel stepparent, self-absorbed parents, and dysfunction in many aspects of their personal lives is to get a glimpse into the psyche of the majority of today's adults. Groundbreaking in its scope and ambition, it is a classic look at a slice of American life at the turn of the century. As John Updike once wrote, ""We are cruel enough without meaning to be."""
BOYHOOD,10 December 2014,7/10,"This film is not bad but it definitely is not as excellent as reviewed by many. Many people who have loved it say that it is nothing ever seen before and that their life was transformed by it but really the only thing that is different about it is the way it was filmed. The acting was not really motivating, the story (unless you identify with the characters which seems to be the case for many people)is not something that will transform you. I say unless people feel identified or are easily convinced by the opinions of others this is really not as great. I am not saying it is not good, it's just the high expectations that others have created upon it are not really met. It is a good concept and there are parts that are worth watching. It will for sure maintain the audience waiting for the next thing in the life of Mason. It is worth a watch just don't expect a lot of action."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,10/10,"Maybe it's not a wise thing to rate a film while it's still 'young', but for this one I can confidently say - it is the masterpiece. Under the term 'masterpiece' I don't assume some high art concept, where you would have to analyze every scene for 30min in order to figure out what was the actual hidden message that creators intended for you to see. Of course, that kind of films have their own gems but 'Boyhood' is something completely opposite and precisely that is its greatest value.You should know one thing, this is a growing up story of completely average boy coming from typical American family. And believe me, there is nothing out of ordinary about this family or this boy which could create the plot. No superpowers, no undercover sociopaths, no scary skeletons in the closet. The plot will be just everyday life. All of you who are familiar with Richard Linklater and his 'Before...' trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight) already have a good idea what I'm talking about. This man is simply genius when it comes to portraying ordinary life stories and events. His scenes and dialogues are 'life live' or the closest thing which can be accomplished. Exactly that trait makes the art in Linklater's films. Storyline doesn't seem to have fixed course and direction, just like real life usually doesn't... Each of his characters is like a person which you actually met and with whom you exchanged ideas, opinions and world views. Because of that you will remember these imaginary people long after you've forgotten the film which spawn them. While 'Before' trilogy was focused on several hours in the life of two romantic individuals and their intelligent conversations, 'Boyhood' is giving us wider picture. In the end it wont just deliver a story of one kid but the stories of all the people who in some way effected his development. In the first place I was little worried that all the hype about this film was coming from the curious fact that actors and whole crew dedicated 12 years of their lives to make something different in the world of cinematography... This is so much more than that ! Boyhood is quite an ordinary story that is in some way applicable on coming-to-age stories of all of us."
BOYHOOD,13 November 2014,10/10,"I'm going to make this short, sweet and simple:Oscar for Best Picture: Boyhood.Best Director: Richard Linklater.Best Male Actor: Ellar Coltrane.Best Female Actor: Patricia Arquette.Best Male Supporting Actor: Ethan Hawke.Go see it, and if it's not in theaters when you read this, buy the DVD. You will not regret it.Truly the best motion picture of this year and probably this decade. Don't waste your time and money on all the ""big"" motion pictures with all the special effects and glitz and hype. This is the movie to see."
BOYHOOD,26 July 2014,9/10,"BOYHOOD is an amazing accomplishment, if a little uneven. The movie was filmed over a 12 year period using the same actors, and a young boy and his sister transform into adults before our eyes. It's an idea that I'm sure a lot of people have had. I know I did, particularly as a fan of the UP documentaries. But Richard Linklater actually did it! The results are pretty good. The story is composed of slices of the life of Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, starting from the age of 6 and going into the college years. I often wondered what a film would be like if actors could play their roles both as children and adults. Visually, the outcome is not as different as I thought it might be. I still had to look closely sometimes to see which character was which as they grew.Linklater is an excellent filmmaker. He made what is probably my all-time favorite trilogy in the BEFORE movies. His direction and pace in BOYHOOD got me invested in the characters, especially in the first half of the film. The downside to filming this movie throughout such a long period is that there are inconsistencies with the acting of the children, who were not professional actors. I often felt that their characters changed inorganically as they got older, and that's due to novice changes in acting styles.A major problem for me is the central performance. Coltrane starts out as a solid child actor, but as he gets into his teens he becomes stiff, uninteresting and detached. Some have explained that he perfectly portrays an awkward and withdrawn teen, but this idea is invalidated as the character enters young adulthood, though the actor remains stiff and uninteresting. Some lines are thrown in to address the problem, as when Mason's stepdad snaps that he's always mumbling things, and when his girlfriend comments about Mason's gloomy disposition. But I suspect this dialogue was added by Linklater as he noticed his actor's energy wane in the late stages of filming. I seriously doubt the teen Mason was originally written as withdrawn. If that were the case, we'd have to believe that Coltrane is this brilliant method actor who was able to perfectly transform himself into a listless and boring teen. It didn't feel like acting to me, but more like lack of acting skills.I never thought I would say this about Patricia Arquette, but she gave the only brilliant performance in the film. I've always thought of her as an average actor, but here she is nomination-worthy as the kids' mother. Ethan Hawke is pretty good as the father, but did he film all his parts at the same time? He's the only actor who didn't age one day throughout the film! :P Now would I rate BOYHOOD as highly as I did had the exact same movie been filmed over a couple of months? I would probably have to say no. At two hours and forty-five minutes the film is too long. It loses some steam in the last hour. But the fact is that the film was not made in a few months, and we see children and adults age before our eyes. That in itself has value. So despite the problems, BOYHOOD is no less than spectacular. I know how hard it is to make a film, and it's amazing that Linklater kept this project going for 12 years. And in doing so, he delivers a groundbreaking coming of age story that puts his audience in a unique vantage point."
BOYHOOD,24 July 2015,4/10,"This text has an ability to drop the medium of film to a dysfunctional state. Whilst the actors shine this vehicle has no ability and it's wheels fall off. There is no momentum in this film despite been shot over 12 years. It starts, it stops, three hours later. What brought this film to my notice was the attention that the Berlin Film Fest had given it. Why? Exactly what for? Perhaps a 12 year investment was such a lure for the prize. It has nothing under it's finger nails to show for such effort. It's a beautiful, unreal, and nourished world.The narrative is a one dimensional 'Post Modernist' view of life. Simple is both complex and simple. Simple is mysterious and boring. This is my third offering from Ethan Hawke and all have been impeccably dressed. Pope Alexander was right."
BOYHOOD,30 October 2014,10/10,"Boyhood,, one of the few features that i can say ""BIG RESPECT TO THE CAST AND CREW & WHOEVER PARTICIPATED IN MAKING IT"" considering the production shooting time took 12 years and sum them in 165 minutes film. The factor which no other films i personally know done it in 1 feature, that you can actually watch and sense the actors and characters literally & honestly growing and maturing in the picture. It is not appealing for people who are looking for a novelist twist or a hollywoodic plot but the drama in this feature is real and related to common Americans and the nostalgia in it is memorable. Tip my hat to the editor and directors of photography. Beautiful piece indeed and efforts nicely put."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,1/10,"No spoiler needs to be flagged here. It was spoiled from the start.165 minutes of nothing. A waste of film and 13 years. I haven't watched a movie boring in years. At best, Patricia Arquette was almost ray light. However the movie was so bad I even got tired of seeing her.If I had rented this movie at Redbox for $1, it wouldn't have been worth it.Cartoons have more depth.I'm not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a Golden Raspberry. Since it took 13 years you could give the Golden Raspberry for lifetime achievement."
BOYHOOD,14 January 2015,10/10,"Richard Linklater's Boyhood might be one of my favorite movies of all time. It works because it shares mundane and even quotidian details about everyday life in a way that enabled me to relate and reflect on how things have worked out in my own life as a boy, boyfriend, man, husband, and father. Scene after scene, I was moved by familiar things depicted in the story: Songs, neighborhoods, classrooms, teachers, public places,food, and even conversations. To me, the genius of Linklater's 12-year filming timeline is that he was able to show how people's personalities remain fixed over time, and yet life experiences operate to deepen and redeem our characters. Those who come to this film looking for abstraction or art-house pretentiousness (preciousness?) will be disappointed. But if you watch this movie with attention to how your heart is reacting to characters and their development in each scene, you will be strangely warmed, maybe even encouraged, and certainly challenged by the simple questions life poses that often take years to answer."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2014,10/10,"It's true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without.This is more than a coming of age story; the title ""Family"" or ""Motherhood"" would be just as appropriate. Set in Texas, the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of Linklater's other work: a film that begins with dialog unlike any other Linklater films evolves into thoughtful, poignant discourse not unlike that from the ""Before"" series. One character in a late-night nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady ""Waking Life."" With that said, this absolutely is not a mere think piece. What makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is, given its scope. Without giving any narrative away, I'll say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises. I watched many films at Sundance 2014 (including comedies), and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout: we laughed, gasped, covered our eyes, and I am sure more than a few of us wept.The characters are well developed. Don't be fooled by the title --- the spirit of Boyhood is alive here, but the female characters are thoroughly developed, distinct, and alive. Unfortunately, though it's 2014, this is a rarity in cinema.Like in ""Waking Life"" and ""A Scanner Darkly"", Linklater has again delivered true visual innovation. This time, however, his set-up is simple: shooting on film, Linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse. Has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? Linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly. Despite this, the effect is riveting.I am not exaggerating when I say that after I watched this film I sold all of my other tickets to Sundance films. Viewing Boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that I didn't want to tarnish the experience by any comparison. Everyone in the Eccles theater shared a special few hours together. Though this only premiered a few days ago, I am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our time."
BOYHOOD,3 January 2015,1/10,"I'm going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show that I have ever reviewed, and I have watched a lot of them. ""Boyhood"" seemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting enough to give it a shot, but what really made me go to see it were all of these reviews calling it a ""masterpiece"". This may have been one of the WORST movies I have ever seen.If sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2 hours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then I highly recommend this film. I honestly have no idea how someone could even call this a good movie, let alone a ""masterpiece"" or a ""once and a lifetime experience"". I'm legitimately angry that I watched this movie."
BOYHOOD,6 February 2014,10/10,"BOYHOOD...What a great movie! I simply believe in America again! They are also humans, guys, trust me:) Its obviously doesn't matter if you are an American, German or Russian. There are the same problems, the same ways, the same love inside us. As a Russian I must say I understand American people and also myself much much better with this movie. It was like... about me... I just COULD NOT imagine how much we are all the same.. Just love it!﻿ If I look at my childhood in the former USSR I see not much difference, the cars and houses are different, we spoke Russian, but that feeling, that pulse of life, that sometimes ""lost"" fathers and mothers to solve every day problems, fighting for the existence and good life for the children are so familiar to me.. That long hair and piercing.. Oh boy, its all so much alike. And those ""Paul was greater than the others..."". The movie is just breathing, its a three hours of fresh air!I do not want to say much about the qualities of the movie.. It is overall brilliant. I do believe, this will be a classical film, and students all over thew world will study it in future at their film schools. P.S. Sorry for my poor English."
BOYHOOD,7 January 2015,10/10,"Boyhood is a sensational film. Simple as it has to be, touching as need be. A great storyline with good performances and with an original idea: follow the life of a boy, for twelve years. It seems something crazy, but it worked. Richard Linklater again does a great job, a work, a film to be seen more than once and deserves to be watched by all. A classic for the future. Boyhood is life as it is, from its difficult moments, to moments of happiness ... It's a film to open the eyes in and show us how life itself looks like a movie, and as it passes too quickly for us realizing the things we face, the things we left behind, dreams that turned to dust ... In short, Boyhood is a single film."
BOYHOOD,15 February 2014,10/10,"This film blew me away and it is hard to describe why. Seeing it together with 1,500+ captivated and enthusiastic people at one of the Berlinale Friedrichstadt-Palast screenings surly helped. Yet, what makes this film so unique and touching is its deep humanity. Although it is a fictional piece, you can't help not to relate to the actors as if it would be a documentary. Every scene feels like real life. I know that this is not necessarily a good thing to say about a movie but it is meant as a compliment.The actors deliver an outstanding performance. While much has already been said about the main characters, I was also deeply impressed by the performance of the side characters as well. As an example, the actor of the second husband of Olivia excels in one of the most emotionally straining scenes of the movie. The dialogs are touching and feel just natural. There are so many scenes and details in the movie where you feel unbelievable close to the actors. When Patricia Arquette says as mother Olivia ""I thought there would be more"" you instantly think about your own (family) life and its constant flux.I surely hope that this movie will make it to as many screens as possible. Also, I hope that no distributor will force additional editing on it. It is perfect as it is and worth any minute. If you like people in general and families in particular, you will love this movie."
BOYHOOD,26 October 2020,3/10,"I see a lot of people rave about this movie but i was less than impressed. the writing wasn't realistic to me and the acting was really really bad in my opinion. i do think the idea was great and it was executed well, as well as there being great character development. but the acting just left me not impressed."
BOYHOOD,4 March 2015,2/10,the movie boyhood beats all the movies so far by one feature; that they have been worked on it for whole 12 years with the same actors and the crew. it talks about the story of the real childhood of a lot of kids in the USA. And that is the true heart of the movie that most people didn't get so they give it bad reviews. the other thing is that is describes life and how it goes on and how we try to appreciate every moment above the ground so the film delivers a spectacular story line that grabs your emotions with great job from Richard Linklater; just thinking of how they edited the film and put the clips together astonishes me . the actors did a great job in this film especially Ethane Hawke and Patricia Arquette that had a big part of this success. the movie in so near to perfection !!!
BOYHOOD,30 June 2015,2/10,"After all the great reviews and because of the high IMDb rating I was really looking forward to 'Boyhood'. I really love films about youth and school because that was a time in my life witch wasn't really easy for me and its always interesting to see how others handled all that. But watching this one I was most of the time bored, waiting for something to happen that I didn't see coming 5 minutes before. I really like drama and I don't have a problem with movies 2 and a half hours long. I really like slow films. But all in all most important on a movie is to ENTERTAIN, I think. We all where (are) kids thru a period of our lives. Parents get divorced, mothers have shitty boyfriends and school is school. I wasn't really entertained when all this happened in my life so why should I be entertained from watching a movie about exactly that? Maybe to reflect about that period of my life, that would be a good thing. too. But the mood of the film and the cutting didn't really allow that for me.Boyhood is a perfect example that today, how a movie was made, seems to be more important than what the movie is about. ""Oh, they filmed 10 years - this one have to be good!""Please save the 2,5 hours and take a walk in the park - three times more entertaining than this film."
BOYHOOD,22 February 2015,10/10,"Director Richard Linklater opens his film with a shot of our main character, Mason, looking up to the sky. To him, the world and its future is unknown to him, though he continues to look up - ready to find what the world has in store for him. The degradation of Mason's view of the world, from the endless possibilities of fantasy to his later realistic view, in Linklater's sprawling 12 year epic, is a constant theme in the story. We see a boy grow up physically as well as mentally, and through the dull moments that make this happen, the extraordinary ordinary shines bright. Filming for a week each year over the course of 12 years demanded impeccable and unprecedented direction from Linklater, a man sure to go into the hall of greats after his masterful work here, who has to coherently connect the most important parts of this boy's childhood. Avoiding continuity gaps in age, while also not overplaying the seemingly irrelevant, demonstrates the masterful hand of one of cinema's greatest minds. Both Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke turn in career landmark performances as the mother and father of Mason. Arquette's character is resilient and protective, but not without emotion when it is most demanded. Hawke's character is sometimes self-centered, but loving, ultimately, and helps guide Mason into the man that he becomes. The way in which Linklater directs Mason to who he is is subtle and fulfilled, showing that not everything need be explained, but felt, in the medium of film. Boyhood is the greatest depiction of normal American life put to film, unrelenting in its grip of understanding and unforgiving in its power. It's unprecedented and impossible to remake. It is unlikely that a film like this will ever be made again, and Linklater has shown himself as a master of the craft. A true American classic that will cement itself into the halls of cinematic history, alongside Forrest Gump, The Godfather, and Citizen Kane, in due time. 10/10."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2015,3/10,"Having heard about a ground breaking film that took 12 years to film using the same cast I expected this to be the best film in years. What a disappointment!This film is 12 years of real life squeezed into 3 long hours. There is no major hook, we just follow Mason as he grows from a young boy to a monotone, uninteresting teen. Although people can relate to this normal boy growing up, it's not enough to justify the poor storyline. Yes, we are watching people grow up on screen but it lacks any sense of adventure, drama or emotion. We have watched Kim Kardashian grow up on screen for the last 10 years with much more excitement and drama."
BOYHOOD,1 March 2015,,"The screenplay is awesome, the music is awesome. The editing is awesome. But the actors are horrible. I feel like they don't get the lines. All they do is standing there and say the lines. I can't feel any emotions at all. It doesn't feel like Mason even considers his mother mother, since every time he talks to her he looks like a zombie without any emotions whatsoever. Overall, this movie is just plain boring and dull, and super long. It could be way better than this, considering the plot and everything. But I don't think the actors did a good job at communicating something to the audience, isn't that the whole point of making a movie? I don't want to see a couple of normal guys living their normal life with their alcholic fathers, I believe a lot of us have encountered this type of thing or at least see this happening to people we know. The movie is supposed to make it art, instead of like a documentary without any artistic decoration."
BOYHOOD,13 March 2015,3/10,"I had high expectations, since the movie was nominated for Oscar in so many categories. Honestly, Patricia was good - but her Oscar win wasn't justified, considering the other nominees.I tried to understand the meaning of it all. It's almost three hours of watching a boy living one of the most mundane, uneventful, depressing life I've ever seen. He's supposed to be the main character, isn't he? Well, He doesn't act like one. He doesn't do anything to move the plot forward; simply reacts (or being completely indifferent) to one ordinary event after another.It is a life, one that most of us can relate to. A bit of family issues, some romance, a smudge of violence and bullying, teenagers being teenagers. It seems like Mason isn't getting the point of it all either.I get the hype about it being filmed over 12 years or whatever. But throughout the movie I was waiting for something that will make me think, feel something, other than ""OK... and?"". I wasn't looking for cheap thrills or anything, but I thought that there was an opportunity to make something meaningful of the story. This opportunity was, sadly, missed."
BOYHOOD,21 December 2015,9/10,"This is a story about growth,this is a story about us.The story is kind of ordinary, parents have no composite, each have their own life, no one has a ever after happy, because the story is still continuing. One thing that touches me is when Mason graduated from high school and ready to go to college, the mother suddenly fell out of control and cried, saying ""I just thought there would be more"".To be honest,this mirrors my mom and all mothers in China.They devote their life to their children,send them off to college,but after that,some part of their life is missing.Now, I am in college,but my can't afford my tuition fee and still depend on my parents like every college student in China, this is really sad. After all, time will stay in memory.in fact, time is static, just a moment to seize us, let us stay at the moment."
BOYHOOD,6 November 2014,10/10,"This movie is undoubtedly one of the best of the decade. It's like No Country for Old Men, Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, The Departed, There will be Blood and The Dark Knight. All of them considered the best of the 2000s.It's the first of it's kind and it doesn't turn out to be a money grab but instead a must see. Because it takes place over 12 years the acting changes and so does writing, directing and the overall environment. Simply, it matures.If this isn't up there for best pic at the Oscars someone will have to answer for there crimes.PS not a family movie (more details in parents guide)."
BOYHOOD,2 December 2014,10/10,"This movie is certainly the best of the year , perhaps of the decade.I think it probably impacted me more than others,because I have a similar age that the actor have,so it was kind of nostalgic in some situations.I could see the changes that the actors were having in a subtle way ,and that was just very natural.Its very interesting you see a 10 years old boy playing video games and in just some minutes the same boy looking for a job or looking for relationships.It shows in a brilliant way ,how time its easily gone.I don't really think it is possible to do a spoiler with this movie , but if its possible , perhaps the following paragraph may contain.The end is fantastic.In the very moment the movie is over , you think,you feel the moment (present moment) and you just know that life is built of little moments , and this movie was certainly one of mine."
BOYHOOD,3 March 2015,5/10,"Trust me when I say this; this movie is not bad, but it's definitely not good. If you expect a masterpiece beyond limits when watching this, you're going to be fatally disappointed. I did that. I expected a movie that would be touching, epic and just amazing in every way, but what I got was a mediocre attempt at this. The concept of making a movie that takes place over 12 years is really interesting, and Richard Linklater does a good job directing it, plus it has a nice feeling about itself. Unfortunately, that's about it. There's no story whatsoever, and every attempt of getting through with something profound and meaningful, just turns into some sort of existential drivel. It starts of well, with a nice simple, but not boring, story. Mason Jr. is actually pretty likable as a kid, but as the movie progresses just turns into a cynical a-hole that's rude to everyone he meets. Ellar Coltrane's acting wasn't bad as a kid, and not really as an adult either, but I couldn't like him, nor feel for him. And to the biggest doubt of all. How the actual hell did Patricia Arquette win an Oscars for her performance?"
BOYHOOD,26 July 2014,1/10,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen, truly. Expecting an interesting insightful chronicle, instead you get a warped concept and a painfully dysfunctional family. The pace was slow, uninteresting, and unreal. It was like listening to a college student perpetually asking, ""What is the meaning of life,"" instead of moving ahead in life. Since it was also difficult to identify with any of the characters, the viewer is left on the outside listening to someone boringly philosophize their view of life. My wife and I went to see it because of the extremely high rating, but instead were imprisoned in a far too long film. Perhaps critics ignored the trite story and awarded the successful unique achievement of filming the same person over twelve years. Ethan Hawke was outstanding as usual, and it was nice to see Patricia Arquette of Medium fame again. Otherwise save your money and especially your time."
BOYHOOD,16 December 2014,10/10,"Two hours and forty minutes summarize twelve years of a boy's life. The director Richard Linklater began this project in 2002. Shooting one week per year, Linklater was able to show in a simple way, the personality of a man being formed. Something never seen in cinemas, for sure. The screenplay is simple and doesn't appeal for melodrama. Even with dramatic moments, they are always short scenes. After all, these moments happen in everybody's life. But they always pass. The simplicity of the screenplay is one of the biggest achievements of the movie. Without expository dialogues, it totally convinces the audience. But that happens because of the actors too. Mason, the protagonist, is interpreted by Ellar Coltrane. His performance is very natural. It is very interesting and touching the way that he grows up and discovers life. It's one of the subtleties of the movie. Beside Mason, the film ends up showing the story of the characters who are related to him. Patricia Arquette is his mother. The way that she transmits the growing of the character is impeccable. Other actor who is excellent in this film is Ethan Hawke. Mason's father. The dialogues between father and son are very natural. ""Which Beatle is the best?"", ""Are they going to make another Star Wars?"", etc. Richard Linklater's direction is very good either. First of all, it's necessary to highlight his courage and patience to realize such project. The movie has some gorgeous sequence-shots. Some of them are even repeated as a narrative technique. Richard creates a very beautiful visual message. The soundtrack is great too. Beside of memorable and touching, the songs help to situate the audience in time. For example, the movie begins with Coldplay's ""Yellow"", showing us that we are in 2002. ""Boyhood"" is a movie like no other. It is impossible not identify with at least one moment of Mason's life. For that reason, the innovation as a cinematographic work, the direction details and the simplicity of the screenplay, ""Boyhood"" is a memorable movie. One of the best (if not THE best) of the year."
BOYHOOD,11 February 2015,1/10,"IMDb 8.2 rating? Seriously? This is basically the worst movie I ever seen. I am still very sorry for my 3-hour-in-life has been wasted. A week has been passed AND I AM STILL VERY SORRY! So I decided to write my very first review here to tell people how bad this movie is.If I wanna watch a movie, I wanna watch movie with plots, with happenings, with characters development but not a ""real-life-like"" ( boring, pointless )film. If I wanna watch a ""real-life"" something, I rather watch a penguin grow old in 12 years with its family and I am sure it will be more interesting than watching Boyhood. The boy before aged 8 still adorable, but once he is in high school, he became a puppet with no facial expression and act like nothing worth him for a laugh.This movie is long like I have been spending 12 years in the cinema, it's like forever. I literally clapped when its end as I am too excited and over the moon that the movie is finally over.Boyhood definitely deserved a best picture: Best picture to sleep on Best picture that deserved the worst picture EVER! Best picture to make you feel regret for your 3-hours-in life Best picture to exchange puzzled eyes with your friends during the whole movie"
BOYHOOD,28 July 2014,10/10,"You are basically part of the family. There are so manifold details on actual problems in the modern family. Even though Mason is the main character the problems of the broader entourage are covered (from an observer perspective but still a very impressive experience). The periods of life that one enters show brilliantly the personnel development of the principal character. Characters, relationships, or narrative dimensions that are dismissed in the course of the film leave room for imagination and interpretation - and as well are emblematic for life and its turns. All this completed by impressions of American life, cities and landscapes adds up to a fulminate movie that you just don't want to end. I think the most overwhelming detail was the fact that I kind of recognized me in some ideas and thoughts of his. This might be why it struck me that way and left me no choice but voting 10 out of 10!"
BOYHOOD,4 November 2014,10/10,"I think this movie is great, special. but not for the story or the characters, some people thought it's a biography or an emotional movie .. well, this movie is not, so they came disappointed talking about how this movie is boring! if you want to see a sweet movie that you can enjoy and go on, you will hate this movie, ""Richard Linklater"" did't take 12 years to make movies like The Fault In Our stars, he have something to say about the meaning of life, real life not fake one, and how people deal with it.so this movie about the philosophy of life, you see people growing up in 12 years, they are normal people, so you suppose to think about your childhood. there are some keys in the script to catch the idea, before the end, Mom (Patricia Arquette) looks back and discovers that her life came to end, her two child left the house and now she is lonely in a small flat, she cries and says ""I thought it would be more""people who hate this movie thought that would be more in a 12 years making movie, but in the real life nothing actually happens, you just grow up fast, and you never ""seize the moment""at the last scene, Mason meets a girl in his first day of collage, she told him that people say ""seize the moment"" are wrong : ""I am thinking it's the other way around. you know, like the moment seizes us."" Mason agreed with this, every one who love this movie will catch this .. it is the mean massage of the movie, (DON'T REGRET ABOUT YOUR SH*t LIFE) because ""the moment, it is just .. it is like it's always right now""now you suppose to understand this movie, if you say it's waste of time, and nothing is happen, well go and watch Twilight Saga! I bet that is your favorite type. if you get the idea of this movie you keep watching it more and more, and every time you will remember your life. there is a waste of time to search a meaning for how many years or what success you achieved or not. Because in real life there nothing happens, except living .. you live each moment, and each moment seizes you while you are looking to seize the moment."
BOYHOOD,22 August 2014,5/10,"The tracking of these characters over a 12 year period is interesting and impressive, but the movie has gaping plot holes and character development that is either unexplained or unbelievable. Some of the characters are just caricatures kind of thrown up on the wall with no support or explanation. The actors who play the two leads, Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater, are one-dimensional actors in this movie and play very morose, seemingly depressed youth who drag themselves through life - they certainly don't demonstrate any joy for living. You can understand why Mason's high school girlfriend breaks up with him. Mom's two husbands go haywire with no development or warning, and this is especially jarring in the transformation of the second husband, who goes from being a very cool guy who is an understanding stepfather and husband to being someone's idea of a vet who goes bad. And how could Dad go from being a flaming liberal to finding happiness with the stereotyped bible-thumping, gun-toting Republican Texas family? In the end, the continuity of the actors is the thing, but the acting and plot development disappoints and leaves one feeling empty at the end."
BOYHOOD,17 August 2014,3/10,"This is not a good movie by any measure whatsoever. The popularity of reality TV has obviously spilled onto the big screen. Lets get the the good stuff out of the way. The acting is pretty good and the 12 year span of the story in which they had to perform was a novel and courageous accomplishment in spite of the glaring casting errors that were not evident until the kids stated to mature. That's it ! There is no plot, just a series of vignettes all without ending, a most frustrating feature of this epic. The first hour has to rank as one of the most boring in movie history. A moody little boy and his perky sister interacting very slowly and painfully in totally uninteresting little episodes of nothing but everyday boring life but with no endings to the episodes. Just as your interest is piqued - as in the vignette where the now teenager is punished by his photography teacher for not completing assignments. The boy hates football, so the teacher assigns him a weekend football game photo project comprising 300 shots, all to be categorized, developed and presented the following Monday morning. We see him shooting the game, the crowd the cheerleaders et al and, as with all of these little vignettes, are drawn in to the story. But once again, NO BLOODY ENDING ! We never find out what happens on Monday, instead we are transported a few years into the future for another never-ending vignette. If you like reality TV,then perhaps you are conditioned to this sort of pointless, plot less tripe. If not, go and watch this anyway, just so you can enhance your appreciation of real movies with plots."
BOYHOOD,22 July 2014,2/10,"I always look for the gem amongst the summer blockbusters that makes you think. After all the critical hype I was salivating at the prospect of seeing this film. What a crashing disappointment !!Take away the gimmick of filming it over 12 years and you have a film that frequently references ""American Pie"". So many cliché characters - single mom coping with bad mating choices and struggling to bring up two lively children;the characters of the said lively children; the hippy dad who turns into the antithesis of everything he talks about at the start of the movie; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the educational establishment; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the prison service;a grandparent couple who give bibles and shotguns as ""coming of age"" birthday presents; geeky teenager who scores with not one but two stunning girlfriends - the list goes on. At the end of the movie the thought that hit me was ""Is that it?"". I had hoped that Linklater might be another chronicler of current America as it still is a puzzle for us in the rest of the world but in this film there is nothing new being said. For that there is still only John Sayles."
BOYHOOD,26 July 2014,2/10,"I went into Boyhood thinking it would be a film that would be incredibly meaningful to me as a young white American man, one that would inspire reflection.Instead, I found a shockingly dingy, depressing, poorly written film virtually lacking in character arcs.There isn't much of a plot, but spoilers ahead as I note some of the most unpleasant aspects.1) First, in a movie like this, it would have been best to have the main character be one that the audience can relate with. Instead, we get an apathetic, fairly unpleasant young man who appears to be interested in little other than ""going along with the crowd"" to engage in vandalism and underage substance abuse, and photography. When I think of my childhood, I think of my achievements (scholastic and extracurricular), my failures, the times I cried and was hurt emotionally or physically, and the moments that defined my future. We get really none of that here! Mason never cries, he never really achieves anything (aside from a second place award in some photo contest), never thinks about his future (why couldn't get we get a conversation with young Mason about what he wants to be one day?), never gets a moment of inspiration. Why couldn't get get a moment where his love of photography ""clicked""? There seems to just be a massive missed opportunity of showing important childhood moments.He just ""grows up"" - he doesn't experience any sort of character arc. It would have been much better to see him as an apathetic elementary school student who turns into an ambitious high schooler (or vice versa), or a young athlete who gets injured and forced to cope or something. Instead, nothing really changes other than his age and he doesn't really do anything, stuff just happens to him.Subplots are introduced them just dropped. He randomly gets bullied one time for reasons we aren't aware of, he barely reacts, and then we don't see it happen again. Also, why the complete lack of sports? Seems like an easy missed opportunity to introduce more drama and a character arc and have something that most American young men would be able to relate to from childhood.2) The mother's character is probably the worst written character in the movie. She too does not have much a character arc. In the beginning she is a poor woman who is pathologically addicted to introducing her kids to abusive alcoholics, and in the end she is the same person with a masters degree. After the fourth abusive alcoholic, I started checking my watch. Did the vice always have to be the same for both her and the guys? Couldn't she have stopped doing that after two guys? Huge missed opportunity to have a real character arc with the mother.Of course, in the running for worst written actress is the sister, to whom nothing happens. She has virtually no character traits much less a character arc or journey.3) Some parts of the film are grossly unrealistic. For example, this awkward, passionless, apathetic kid gets to date these beautiful Hollywood actress-level beauties (hint: because they were). The liberal/Obama commentary was grating and frankly incongruous with the characters in rural Texas. Finally, Mason somehow finds himself in Hollywood moments where adult women make sexual comments about him to him, something that doesn't really happen much outside of movies and almost certainly not to awkward and apathetic kids like Mason.4) Most of the peripheral characters are clichéd. Every stepdad and boyfriend is abusive and alcoholic and really nothing else. Really? The director couldn't think of any other character traits? Frankly, almost every adult in this movie is kind of a jerk. We couldn't see even one teacher who gave a great lecture that was meaningful and inspiration? We got the one dark room conversation that was slightly bizarre and unpleasant.I gave the film a 2 because panning it with a 1 seemed a little harsh for such an ambitious film. However, pure ambition does not, de facto, mean the film is a ""good film,"" and in this case it is not a good film by traditional measures."
BOYHOOD,2 August 2014,2/10,"I am totally blown away by people's reviews of this trial-by-ordeal waste-of-three-hours. It was simply AWFUL. The only thing good about this movie was watching the characters age, something that could be accomplished by any hack who aimed a camera at a group of people every year for twelve years. The characters, when not totally flat (and wow, that was most of them most of the time), were annoying. The self-absorbed, narcissistic posturing of the father (Ethan Hawke) was especially grating, especially when it was clear that we were all supposed to fall in love with the guy and regard him as a hero of the film. The son (Ellar Coltrane) played your classic slacker who thinks he's deep, but let me tell you, if you've spent significant time around 19-year-olds, this kind of ""deep"" is the sort that can only seem profound when you are seriously stoned or seriously young or seriously stupid. I watched this movie with my husband, and by hour two we were snorting and hitting each other and rolling our eyes in our desperation for these people to do something, anything, that was interesting. I give it a two, because we didn't leave the theater, though that was partly because we couldn't believe that it would be that bad, and continue to be that bad all the way through. I honestly don't know who my fellow moviegoers are that they should find this such an incredible film."
BOYHOOD,2 August 2014,3/10,"*Caution: May contain spoilers*This movie is an example of a great idea with very poor execution. Using the same actors over the 12 year period is nothing short of brilliant. The praise stops here. I must warn you, if you are not an Obama fan, there is a scene where they put up Obama/Biden posters that will make you want to vomit.The main character in this movie and his sister are literally the most narcissistic people I have ever seen in film. Additionally, the sister is quoted as saying ""You don't really have to listen to your parents once you're 18"". What sound advice coming from a complete moron with an iq of ~85. Mason (main character), is devoid of any drive, intelligence, or the capacity to make well guided life decisions. Both kids live with their mother (another piece of work, but we'll get to that soon enough), and even though she devotes herself entirely trying to give them a decent life, they show absolutely no appreciation.The film moves so quickly between Mason's stages of life that the character development is uneven to the point that you feel like you're reading a book by skipping a few dozen pages every so often. Speaking of characters, the mother is the most naive person in the movie. Her idea of getting a ""real job"" is going back to University of Houston and getting a masters in Psychology; what a joke. She marries not one, but two abusive drunks. Her only redeeming quality is her devotion to her kids. Save for the hyper-liberal Obama ass kissing scene, the father is about the only decent character; even if he is a bum for the first half of the movie.As far as the plot is concerned, there isn't one. There are no dramatic scenes or resolutions, no real comedy, no mystery, just...nothing. This is like watching Al's home videos on Home Improvement, but with a better camera.This movie serves nothing more than to be an example of why I hate this country and its culture. Nearly all young persons in the U.S. are a bunch of self entitled narcissists."
BOYHOOD,4 August 2014,6/10,"I was all warmed up to this film based on the glowing reviews. The best thing about it is indeed watching the lead character go through such a pivotal point in his life. I expected that there would be illumination thrown on ordinary moments that we all go through, a way to deliver a new insight. This is true up to a point. But the family situation that is depicted is extremely dysfunctional, so a lot of my attention ended up being on the circumstances and overall painful emotions rather than the ongoing life of the child. All the family members finally come out on the other side with their faculties intact, which was a relief, but this cannot be said to be the rule. To me it just needs to be clear that this doesn't represent a ""typical"" childhood, even though elements of it ring true for more of us than we would like to believe.That being said, there are some good moments, particularly when the fledgling Mason and his girlfriend spend time in Austin. This is obviously a love song to the director's favorite town and the details are pitch perfect. All in all it would have been good to see more of these moment-by-moment details through the eyes of the child throughout the movie rather than intermittently. That would have made it for me."
BOYHOOD,6 August 2014,2/10,"I give it two stars for effort. But I suspect the glowing reviews are due to the fan following of Linklater's films which started with Slacker in 1991. That one was actually interesting. Since then, he's been searching for plot and unfortunately doesn't have much imagination because they're all the same. It's imaginative to follow a child around for his growing up. It's unimaginative to make the story a depressing display of dysfunctional family life. Where I was looking for a coming of age film, I got instead a sad story full of clichés. The trailers should have said ""emotional roller-coaster"" and ""heartbreaking."" Then I would have been warned that this movie is upsetting and hard to watch."
BOYHOOD,15 August 2014,3/10,"After reading the reviews here I had really high expectations of this movie. But to be honest I was a bit disappointed.First of all it is a great concept, filming 12 years so you can see everyone change. But that was the only thing I liked about the movie. I mean the acting is good, but I just found the movie very boring. There is no real story, just ''life'' in a movie. I hoped for a story that would move me, but that never happened in the 2 and a half hours I was watching. I wouldn't say don't watch this movie, but I won't tell my friends about how good it was. Just another movie in my eyes, nothing special. Except for the part you get to see everyone in the movie age, that was special."
BOYHOOD,1 September 2014,6/10,"Utilizing the same actors over several years of filming was a novel idea, and certainly this lent itself to an interesting end. Just as in life the film was sometimes really slow and boring, and at other times fairly interesting. If that was the intent of the film maker I would say the film was a success. I will admit it was nice not to sit through something that was horribly depressing, or violent. It simply was. The five star rating didn't come through for me, regardless of the effort.There were some quirks - at a few points in the film the panning becomes quite blurry and not in a visually intentional manner. I found myself squinting and trying to re-adjust my eyes. Not sure if this was due to the screen I was viewing it on, or just poor editing, but I found it bothersome. Many of the scenes shot while driving were poorly done, reminding me of a bad 70s film. Mason's sister is unbelievable in her character until she reaches a much more mature age.All in all, its a good sit down on a rainy day film either by yourself, or with someone who won't complain about its length and the lack of major ups and downs throughout the plot. I'd see it again, but most likely with the intention of falling asleep on my couch...for me that's a compliment it means the movie was comfortable enough to add to a collection, but did not carry enough impact to illicit a strong reaction one way or another. Go see it, just don't expect miracles or a five star film."
BOYHOOD,14 August 2014,8/10,"Though the length of the movie was quite long, what really made the movie so great for me is the soundtrack and the songs they picked. The statement that this movie made for me was that everything is temporary. What happens in high school won't affect you as much in college and even though some parts or your life might be a real bad situation there's always an upside.I really like how the movie was using the same cast and how they really portrayed realistic situations that happen often in our modern world. I recommend this movie to individuals above fifteen as it is a quite lengthy movie and children won't be able to pay attention and teenagers will get tied into the plot as this is very relatable for them at their age. It touches up on quite a few controversial topics currently happening in the world, like religion, gun laws, underage drinking & drug abuse, physical and emotional abuse, divorce, etc. Coming of age on screen."
BOYHOOD,16 August 2014,9/10,"This movie sounded very unique to me right from the start. This had never really been done before, where we watch the same kid grow up right before our eyes, using the same actor. And there was no voice-over narration, no caption reading ""2 years later"" which really made it all the better, a good artistic touch. He has experiences that most of us should be able to relate to, whether we come from divorced families or not. We remember these moments or these kinds of moments. Highly recommended. I hope Rick gets nominated for an Oscar for this one. And maybe he has started a new trend of filmmaking over time here. Who knows."
BOYHOOD,21 August 2014,10/10,"From beginning to end, this movie had me fixated to the screen. All I could do is relate to Mason. I could relate to the parents as well, as they are were near identical to my own. It makes you feel less alone in the world. I laughed, and I cried. I could relate to nearly every part of this movie. I have watched it twice now and intend on watching it again. To me a production like this is monumental and gives me hope to the film industry. I loved this movie and wish I could give it more than 10 stars. I play the tough guy card but this movie got to me, I could place myself in Mason's shoes and relate to almost every moment. You really don't have a choice, watch this movie, or you're really missing out."
BOYHOOD,23 August 2014,6/10,"Before seeing the movie, I heard so many terrific things about it from friends. I knew it was a coming-of-age movie that was filmed over a twelve year period, following the main actor from childhood into young adulthood. I found this to be daring and refreshing. Naturally, I was excited to see the film for myself. I also felt excited that the main character, Mason, was being played by an actor I have never seen before. I often find that when the Lead in a film is a big Hollywood actor, it is difficult to really believe the character as the character and lose the personality of the actor, himself, that the audience has come to know through other films. This quality in a film about growing up and facing real life challenges was especially enthralling and engaging.To my disappointment, the film had many pitfalls. It felt very monotoned and with a length of almost three hours, that can never be good. I didn't feel emotionally attached to the characters in a way that the audience should in a film such as this. I am unsure if it had to do with the shaky acting, superfluous scenes, or scattered storyline. Overall, I just didn't connect with the film and I felt that Mason's upbringing was too stereotypical and predictable. I found myself thinking about all the ways the film could be better as I was walking out of the theater. I felt let down."
BOYHOOD,30 August 2014,2/10,"Just saw this movie tonight and was very disappointed. This movie was my husband's choice, and all I understood it to be was the life of a boy, filmed over the course of 12 years using all original actors. I left this movie feeling depressed, and thought this to be a very dysfunctional family on so many levels. I kept waiting for some sort of revelation as to why this movie received such good reviews and was highly recommended. That moment never came. Sure there were some familiar scenes that pertained to real life, but I certainly didn't expect the constant inappropriate language to be used in front of small children! When the father did re-connect with his children, I really thought that the family, over time, would be together again. We never really knew what he was doing for a living, but he genuinely seemed to love his children. As smart as the mother appeared to be perceived, her choices in men weren't that great. Lastly, how many people send their own children off to college alone! It's like she loved both her children but couldn't wait for her so called ""freedom""; although she would have a blow-up mattress for visits."
BOYHOOD,21 March 2015,6/10,"Good movie but nothing to rave about, it is way too long and many parts are not interesting and boring. I recommend to watch it in a rainy day when you have nothing better to watch and need to kill sometime. It is entertaining however.there are parts that need more action and less drama. I know it's not an action movie but it the storyline is too plain and very dramatic at some point. I guess it has been so successful because of the length that it took to get filmed. But again it is not about the methods, it's about the content. Maybe many people identify with this film as it is very common and simple, everyday life kind of thing."
BOYHOOD,3 September 2014,8/10,"Boyhood is by its naturalism approach not a spectacular movie as it is defined by the mainstream culture. I believe that's true, it is just depicting the life of a commonplace American family. In this sense, it somewhat makes me think to plenty of plot less Asian movies I've seen.This movie tells: you do not need to come up with spectacular adventures to get entertained and moved! Our lives, made up of all those moments we seized or which seized us (a nod to the last chat between Masen and his new college friend), are all about emotion. That's those realistic emotions displayed on the big screen that perks you up! Until the last breath, you are not looking at the characters; you are looking with the characters since it mirrors your life so genuinely.Though, the 2h45 doesn't seem you really long that you almost yearning to watch more.I really appreciate the final scene. Ending this kind of movie brilliantly is very tricky and even requires pulling off a miracle. And so Linklater did. I should pay tribute to how he brilliantly strips it of any overacted scenes as well (except one overkill, while ordering at the restaurant, the Hispanic manager, previously mum's gardener, showed up telling his terribly cliché story and singing her praises).I didn't talk about the process the movie has been shot. It might be considered genius, but in my view telling so is straying off topic. Basically if you didn't know about it, you would probably fail to notice it."
BOYHOOD,4 November 2014,4/10,"""Boyhood"" is a critical darling, and that's putting it mildly. It has a nice, non-controversial family, and it presents every ""coming of age"" childhood milestone at least once. Thus, it has no focus. The technique, filming the movie over 12 years with the same actors, is an interesting experiment in film. However, its technique gets in the way of quality story telling and substance. Trying something innovative does not mean the film should get a pass and automatically get raves. In the film there's one bullying event, one break up, one drunken night with the guys, one of everything, like a sample platter at Golden Corral. There was even one non-white character in the film. Moreover, there is no follow up on any of the events. What is so masterful about that? The film has a series of disconnected events in a boys life that had no focus. ""Growing up"" is not a plot, no matter how many people are fooled into believing it is. The dialogue was contrived. It's as if every line from teenage Mason was taken from a Smith's song. As I was watching, I couldn't help thinking, ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now "" At least the film didn't have an out of place tragedy like a ""Girlfriend in a Coma."" Yes, I wanted to stop him, for I had heard that one before. Morrissey does pathos better and with him we don't have to suffer through two hours of pretentiousness. Mason was too confident about his misery. His dialogue we pre-packaged, as if he was reciting a script, not living in the moment. The film features a series of moments, a few interesting ones, but mostly tiresome first world problems from an uninteresting boy and family. As a film buddy of mine stated, ""the film could have been called 'The Discreet Charm of the Petite Bourgeoisie.' "" However, it wasn't charming, nor funny, nor revelatory or original like the Buñuel classic. With the exception of Ethan Hawke, who, to be fair, had the best dialogue in the film, the acting was mediocre. Perhaps filming the movie over 12 years made it hard for the actors to stay sharp and focused on their characters, so the acting was uneven throughout. There was nothing of note in the music, other than the cliché' of highlighting the passage of time with a hit song in various scenes. It was cute at first, then it became tiresome. Rating: Rent itIf your sister, mother, brother or friend wants to see it, you can watch it together and not upset anyone with confusing events like actual poverty and unexpected occurrences like black people appearing on the screen. Moreover, you can talk during the film because there is no need to really pay close attention while it is playing. You won't miss anything. Otherwise, see the infinitely better ""The Way Way Back"" if you want to see a cute coming of age movie. This movie has already risen into the pantheon of overrated movies, even before it wins some undeserved Oscars. It was style over substance. If I had to describe this film in one word, other than overrated, it would be ""trite.""Peace, Tex Shelters"
BOYHOOD,14 September 2014,1/10,"The life of a young man, Mason, from age 5 to age 18. Where the actors (Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke) played the film in real time so it took 13 years to make.One of the few films I have ever walked out on. The others were in disgust, but this one I left due to pure boredom. One hour into the film and there had been only 5 minutes of drama, then the film was back to documenting the boring fictional life of a boring fictional family. Now the whole idea of actors who age naturally with the film could have been interesting. But the director completely pooched this fantastic opportunity by slavishly doing the film chronologically (and slooooooowly) instead of mixing it up a bit and showing us the boy's life at 6, then at 18, then back to 15... but instead year trailed after year, and after an hour I really felt like I had lived through those first few years in real time too!So here is my list of things that are more fun that watching BOYHOOD:cleaning your gutters (did that earlier today and found a frog. That was more exciting) - waiting in the waiting room of the dentist (at least there is some suspense) - getting your teeth drilled by the dentist (at least you feel something) - a good bowel movement (the smell only lasts a few minutes, not three hours)I could obviously continue, but you get the drift. This film is the ultimate triumph of style over substance. Nice idea technically, totally forgettable as a film."
BOYHOOD,17 September 2014,10/10,"Boyhood, 1 word that after seeing the film will forever be etched in my mind until the day I die. Richard Linklater tells the coming-of- age story of Mason and his struggles with family, girls and dealing with constant change around him. This was filmed over 12 years and the film justifies the wait, Linklater does an excellent job of jumping forward in time without the viewer even noticing. The beauty of this film is its raw emotion as an 18-year old everything that Mason experiences is extremely relevant to my own life and the film brought me to tears as I watched my own life (through Mason) unfold before my eyes. The performances of Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are excellent, during one point in the film Mason is aggravated that he cant hit the pins while bowling and his father (Hawke) responds with ""You don't want bumpers life doesn't give you bumpers). Masons throughout the film lived a life without bumpers, he dealt with abusive stepfathers, (at times) a deadbeat father, and a single mother who struggled to raise her children in tumultuous times. I advise anyone who is one the fence about this film to go see it and witness the greatest coming-of-age film ever made."
BOYHOOD,20 September 2014,4/10,"If you are expecting anything to happen after the first hour of the movie, think again. Did I mention the movie was almost three hours long? I am sure it was quite an achievement to film a movie over 11 years but I go to films to be entertained. I guess it is necessary for me to continue typing to meet the minimum of 10 lines for this review. This is an interesting parable for the movie, which definitely should have ended at least an hour before it did. Like the movie, I would recommend you only read the first part of my review, which tells you all you need to know. If you have nothing else to do, continue to read my review (and watch boyhood) and you will see you have wasted some of your precious time."
BOYHOOD,26 April 2015,2/10,"I was so excited to see this movie after hearing all the hype (plus, what an amazing concept) and reading all of the positive reviews, but I must admit I am astonished by how much I did not like this film or the actors in it.I thought the acting was horrendous (with the exception of Ethan Hawke) and I am amazed that patricia arquette won an award for this very dull performance. The sister was the worst, especially as she aged, it was like her gimmick was the keep her mouth closed as much as possible while she was speaking. None of the actors brought light to the characters. The plot was so unrealistic and cliché I couldn't stand it. It was honestly a struggle to finish this one. I don't understand what all the hype is about. Save three hours of your life and watch paint dry- it is a better use of your time."
BOYHOOD,3 October 2014,4/10,"I went into this movie cheerful, energized & with high hopes after seeing that it was rated so highly on IMDb. After 2 hours (of the 2.75) I was absolutely ready to leave.On the face of it, it seemed we might possibly receive something along the lines of ""Into the wild"" a brilliant and gripping true story, with many touching moments, but here, instead we get a mostly mundane, repetitive, and dragging collection of snippets, that left me flat. There was little storyline, or remarkable photography. An ordinary performance by Arquette & her unlikeable partners, detracted from the natural understated awkwardness of the ""boy"". Ethan Hawke, as the estranged father was probably the most interesting character.Could the fictional storyline have been any more uneventful? Nothing happens! And I mean nothing..."
BOYHOOD,3 October 2014,10/10,"I walked into this movie expecting something magical from director Richard Linklater and he did not disappoint. At no point did the aging process seem gimmicky, it flowed with each year of his life being one heartfelt episode after another. While I expected there to be some giant emotional scene, one scene that would be sure to make everyone in the theater weep, I'm almost glad I didn't get it. While there were some sweet scenes that I won't get into, I liked this fully honest tale of growing into oneself. With genius writing and wondrous acting, especially from the leads Coltrane and Arquette, with the latter I expect a Best Supporting Actress nomination, this should go down as a film along the lines of many other great coming-of-age films, that everyone, young and old, should experience at least once in their lifetime."
BOYHOOD,11 January 2015,1/10,"Just because this movie's gimmick was that it was filmed over 12 consecutive years, so you witness the kids growing up, does not make this a fantastic movie. The script was awful and went no where. It was nothing but a series of boring, unending vignettes strung together to try and tell a story. Which it failed to do. The characters are one-dimensional, uninspiring, bland, and apathetic. What child, when given a birthday gift--teenager or otherwise--has no reaction, as if he/she is in a permanent brain-dead coma?! How is that 'just like real life' ? Those raving about this movie are just those trying to jump on the bandwagon of the Emperor's New Clothes. Well, (spoiler alert) the Emperor is NAKED! They are saying 'it is just like real life.' I don't know anyone who acts like what was portrayed in real life. No one (outside of Patricia Arqette's one outburst) reacts with any kind of emotion, passion, or pathos.I have had more entertaining experiences getting pat-downs from TSA at airport security. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. If you want to see a movie about kids growing up, filmed over several years watch the Harry Potter series. At the very least you will be entertained."
BOYHOOD,22 October 2014,4/10,"Hello,i do not understand the excellent ratings on this movie and can't find any reason for such a rating.For sure its a unique project to film over 12 years but the story was so ""normal"" that i get bored and asked after one hour when a specialty of the boyhood will appear but until end i was waiting for nothing. For sure the movie isn't bad at all but it also have nothing special in it. All relations between the person are quite normal and the whole boyhood or life-story of his mother and father and sister are real normal like multi-millions of people life it in real life. There is nothing really dramatic or extreme or unexpected in this movie and i by myself know a lot more interesting life-stories to tell.Also its seems not to be taken really continuous over the 12 years of production, it seems like they produced for a half year and they make a 2-year break before continue. This degrades the value of this ""12 years epic"" movie even more.Summary: It looks like a real-based story of an American boyhood and his family, maybe real-based but nothing special in there, no big dramas, no special relations between persons, everything quite normal like millions of people life in real life every day...so it get boring for a over-length movie like this. The only unique thing on this movie is the time they took to produce. So it's sad that they don't do anything special from it. With such a high rating a disappointment for me and all my co-viewers."
BOYHOOD,22 June 2015,1/10,"3 hours of my life that seemed like 12 years which I will never get back. No real plot, terrible acting and very unnatural... the concept is unique but that is all the film has going for it but even that was poorly executed. In terms of entertainment, this film provides nothing that will last long in the memory. If this can win an Oscar ... any man/woman/child/animal would be in with chance.Overall I cannot recommend this film to any person who has the choice to watch this extended, non-dramatic soap opera ... by far the worst film I have seen in my 30 year life!"
BOYHOOD,31 October 2014,6/10,"The idea of filming the movie with the same cast for 12 years is extremely interesting. The journey, resilience, struggle and relationships shown move the audience at times. Some of the conversations shown between Mason and his biological father are engrossing. I hadn't read about the movie so wasn't aware that this 'epic' journeys with the actors in real time. In the initial phases, I kept marveling at the remarkable job the casting crew has done with similar looking actors! What could have been better was certainly the transition in time from one age slot to another. I found it rather abrupt especially when Mason's mother in one scene meets the professor and the very next scene shows Mason and Samantha playing with two more children happily while their respective parents are returning from a so called honeymoon. And barely a scene before that 'mom' had a fight with her boyfriend.I didn't find much character growth in any of the characters expect for Mason's father. The mother keeps making the same mistake of being with a messed up man one after another!She was quite a is appointment. I am surprised at an 8.9 rating for this movie. That's obnoxious! It is a watchable movie but not beyond a 6 on 10."
BOYHOOD,2 July 2015,2/10,"This movie is by far the most over rated movie to date. I really cant see why it has such universal acclaim. This movie is a 4 at best as it has its moments but the majority of this movie is just plain and simply bad. It makes me mad to see this with the same meta critic score as the godfather, a classic that cannot be compared to the likes of this. It also has god awful directing and Richard linklater does not deserve all this acclaim and I am glad too see that the academy see's this. Overall boyhood falls short to my expectations and does not deserve its 100 rating on meta critic. With a combination of awful acting and a god awful script it seems that it had a brilliant idea but fell short putting it to practice. This is why I give it a 4 out of 10 and I hope all of you come to your sense's and realize it is just another overrated piece of s**t. The only good thing this movie has to offer is its good soundtrack and thats it."
BOYHOOD,20 December 2020,10/10,"Boyhood may be the most artistic movie that have ever been shot in the United States. Not because of its screenplay, or casting -but exactly because of the concept it has created. It's such an awesome experience to observe a coming-to-age of a boy, and being with him through 12 years. Some people say the leading actor is time, which I do agree with."
BOYHOOD,2 April 2016,9/10,"The film goes on to explain how the world is seen from a growing up child's point of view. The questions you ask yourself, what a child feels, what it thinks, what it wants to be. Its is the authenticity what makes this movie so personal and even touching. It pinpoints the moments one goes through that impact you to become who you really are. As a child raised up in the 21st century this movie is very accurate in describing what growing up is and how its done. If somebody ever asks me what was it like growing up in 2000s perhaps in 40 years time, i will show them this movie. I think it is more representative of today's generation more than the all others. I can really see how this movie may seem boring because nothing really is going on. This film is a documentary. It is not made for entertainment but to show you a vision, a point of view, Linklater had on what childhood/parenthood is like. For those of you that failed to connect with the movie i don't blame you, but you've got to judge a movie for what it was trying to achieve, and not for what you wanted it to be."
BOYHOOD,13 March 2015,2/10,"Before watching this movie I had read some reviews over here, some said it's a good movie and most were warnings to not watch this movie, and I am actually so regretful I didn't take the advice. This movie is a complete non-sense and a total waste of time. There is no story,no plot,nothing to be watched but silly situations along 12 years of a person's life. 3 Hours lost from my life, I don't even know why I completed watching this movie ! maybe because I thought there's still something to be watched in the rest of the movie, But I was simply wrong. Don't watch this movie and go do something useful in those 3 hours. And here the question remains. Why is such a movie nominated for Oscars, and movies like Interstellar and gone girl are not. Christopher Nolan and David fincher's movies are always under-rated when it comes to Oscars nominations despite how amazing their movies are and their impact on the audience ! I think this remains to be a mystery. I'm writing this review just to tell people to not do what do the same mistake I did because I really regretted not paying attention to those warnings."
BOYHOOD,14 December 2014,4/10,"Nice story, long movie. You feel like it could've been better at the end. Nice story, long movie. You feel like it could've been better at the end.

BOYHOOD,12 November 2014,9/10,"The hard-work of Richard Linklater really seems to be pays off,after watching this movie. Ellar Coltrane has acted very naturally,as if it was based on his short term life. A simple going awesome movie,it was.But i think Richard linklater can improve his screenplay and the writing,the ending of the movie was not so smooth but can be extended by creating a sequel of the movie.Boyhood was different genre,of all the movie has been created by Richard.It was a well plotted movie. and finally i would like to give a general advise,if he can use some of the background score or music in a creative way,it can help viewers to enjoy the movie in a better way.A must watch movie."
BOYHOOD,28 September 2014,3/10,"Imagine this same film was shot over 46 consecutive days, not over 12 years. Different actors are brought in for the various ages of Mason and his sister. The parents age via makeup. Otherwise, every scene, every line, and film length remain unchanged. Would it be getting such rave reviews? Would we hear declarations of brilliance and visionary? No, it would be a bland biopic about an uninteresting teenager and his dysfunctional family. ONLY because it was shot over 12 years using the same actor makes it special.The script is usually boring, showing the bland events of life but rarely carrying through to any resolutions. How did Mason deal with the bullies from the boys bathroom? Did he go to the party that the girl on the bicycle invited him to attend? What happened to the shotgun? Did he ever wear that suit? The bible clearly didn't make an impact. However, we do get resolution on the Hispanic plumber who followed Mason's mom's advice to attend college.To top it off, our central character grows up to be a passive, inarticulate teen who emotes with a shrug of his shoulders and ""I guess"" or ""I don't know."" Wow, what a breakthrough character.To the positive, I did enjoy the walk through memory lane with the cultural references."
BOYHOOD,17 November 2014,10/10,"I read about this movie and I was told it took 11 years to be finished so that the actors could grow up as the movie was being made. Then, I saw the title and read the plot and decided to give this a try. It turned out to be the best decision of the month, maybe of the year. Not only ""Boyhood"" is extremely good, it's also relatable. The film may be 3 hours long but I only noticed how long it was when it was actually over. It's that kind of film that keeps you thinking about anything in life, in your life, and it might be life changing for you, as it was to the main character. Despite not having the most famous cast, every single actor portrays a brilliant role and each one of the main characters shine the whole movie. I highly recommend this one because you never know when we're having a film as good as this."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,6/10,"**SPOILERS** Interesting concept, filming for a few weeks every year or so over the course of 12 years, with the same cast aging with their characters, but I think I know why it is really being nominated for Best Picture. It is to offset the unabashedly patriotic and 'Red-State-Friendly' ""American Sniper,"" plain and simple.The film itself could have been a great film, one for the ages, but the blatant Bush Derangement Syndrome / '0bama is the Messiah' message was unnecessary, heavy-handed, and the way they made young children participate in that false narrative, was also child abuse. And if you didn't get the message, in a 2008 scene, the boy is told to steal a McCain/Palin sign from a lawn, as if it is the right thing to do.Set entirely in Texas, the ONLY person in a neighborhood who refuses an 0bama/Biden lawn sign for his home is a caricature, monosyllabic redneck with a Confederate flag on his house. Really? In Texas. Everyone is a liberal Kool Ade drinker in Texas except for this one guy. Um hmmm. Need another? When warning a young girl about the dangers of teenage sex, she was threatened with being like Bristol Palin - You get the idea.One last thing. Ellar Coltrane, who plays the title character, starts out a a beautiful little boy with a natural acting ability and an easy charm. During the 12 years he undoubtedly got some acting lessons and, by the time he is 18, he looks and acts like a creepy, Emo dolt, who cannot help but mug for the camera to show us that he's acting. Now, if it was intentional to show how a perfect child can be corrupted by his seriously damaged parents and step parents, leaving us with this sexually ambiguous, maladjusted bundle of neuroses at the end, then 'well done' I suppose. But somehow, I do not for one second believe that was the intention. The progressive adults in the story are supposed to be just fine and dandy - role models for Millennials. That's probably the most disturbing thing of all about this overrated indy film."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,5/10,"I can see why this film is being giving love, personal relationships and all that, but I can't help but think that the only reason it is being given *this much* love is because of it's filming time. I'll give appreciation to the time and persistence put into the production, but I really think it could have been something so much more spectacular than it is. Yes, the boy grows up - but I just don't see how that is 10/10 BAFTA worthy to be honest. I think everyone on the planet could guess that outcome - he's 11 years older than he was at the start! If there's a Boyhood 2, let's hope the writers spend the 11 years of filming to come up with a slightly more extravagant ending, because the boy growing into a teenager isn't really the finale that I sat there for almost 3 hours waiting for. For me, that ending ruined a film that had so much potential for 2 hours."
BOYHOOD,2 December 2014,1/10,"I usually don't write these reviews, but I am so anti-inspired, and this way would like to warn people if you don't like first 10 mins, everything later will be even worse. I thought that Skyline is worst movie ever, but after watching this one I am really not sure. The plot doesn't lead anywhere. Almost all characters have horrible personalities, they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives. Scenes are lasting too long, and for many I find no reason of including them to the movie. The movie lasts too long, and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it, you realised it was total waste of time. Just don't make the same mistake."
BOYHOOD,19 May 2015,8/10,"Breathtakingly displayed ups and downs of people's everyday life. So touching, so humane, so relatable. The fact that the film was being shot for 12 years is absolutely insane. You can actually see the people getting older, the kids' voices changing. Even though the film is almost 3 hours long, it certainly doesn't get boring. You actually want more. You want to know what comes next in their lives, You want to know more about them. Definitely a one-of-a-kind movie that leaves you thinking about your own life and what's it gonna be like when you graduate and when you move out from your family's house, when you start your own family. If you want action and drama, this definitely isn't a film for you. But if you want to see beautifully created simple stories of a family, an honest story line that has a one goal and that is to make you experience growing up and getting older from a kid's perspective. Simply great."
BOYHOOD,6 January 2015,9/10,"I am really wondering how a movie could be like that!! it's a whole life ,, so inspiring so great the way that I haven't enjoyed in a long time ...simply ...it's a new genre a new category which makes you think a lot about yourself , your thoughts and your life.from the start of the show which is not boring for even a second by the way , you're wondering whether the mom is right or she's a jerk and the dad was right about the philosophy of spending the life , then you see her find a new responsible husband and say huh she's right then he turns into animal so you're hesitating again and say no the dad was right life is not that serious ...but at the end you find that the life hasn't a fixed right sight So you can enjoy it the way you see without judge people or interested in being judged also you have not to be judgmental. live it as it is ."
BOYHOOD,18 December 2014,1/10,"This movie is based on clichés all over. I tried, really tried to get into it for about 1.5-2 hours, but it was impossible. Seriously, top 5 worst movies I have ever watched. At the beginning, you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable (good performance of some actors, you start getting into the boy's life...). But this hope just fades away as the movie develops as extremely unexciting.Imagine a boring life of a boy living in the USA. Translate that into a 3 hour movie (but taking away any potential exciting moments, the ones with adrenaline, interesting intellectual reflections, sex, etc, etc): that's what this movie is. I am usually not that bold in criticizing movies, but this one deserves it. Sorry, but it does.Even the 10 minutes I watched of ""sharknado"" were better. At least it was a bit funny."
BOYHOOD,24 December 2014,1/10,"I have seen birdemic, birdemic 2, the room, sharknado, and etcetera, but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film. The aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness. Boyhood is neither funny, nor inspiring (or anything positive for that matter). Halfway through the film I felt myself wishing that Ellar Coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced. The concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind. Unfortunately, nothing else was remotely interesting. Please save yourself 3 hours and do something else. Eat some dirt, lick a bee, smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare. anything, and i mean ANYTHING is better than this film."
BOYHOOD,1 January 2015,9/10,"The idea behind movie is utopia. It's like a dream. I can't take a picture of myself for a week without forgive it, so how can a cast work for 12 long years. What every actor was thinking while he played a role that might be his real life? This is not a drama. It was 5.30 a.m when the movie ended and I still was awaken, the movie drove me until almost my age (I'm 23), but I would have seen until the entire life seeing how people change thoughts during their life. Even if I vote 10, I will not see again, because I will remember it for long, but I recommend vision to everyone. The plot is the same of our life. Watch it and think about your life, then give a sense to it. Sorry for my English"
BOYHOOD,29 December 2014,1/10,"This movie was SO boring it made me want to write a 3-hour letter to the director telling him how boring it was. There are much better coming-of-age films. If a film asks you for 3 hours of your time, it must hold your interest for those 3 hours. This movie did not. 4/10 rating for unique idea of filming over 12 years and it's not a *terrible* movie (for example,there were good cinematography, realistic characters, and some good acting). However, this movie does not deserve the critical acclaim it has received. I made an account just so I could review this movie. If you have three hours to kill, start a Dickens novel or something so even if you are bored you can at least improve your mind and your vocabulary. This would be a good movie to put on and fall asleep to."
BOYHOOD,31 December 2014,1/10,"The good reviews made me watch the movie full out and this was one of the worst hours spent in my life. I really have no clue how people can enjoy this movie, only if it resonates with an interest for the mundane, mediocre, average life. The movie has not one interesting plot twist. The main character is an uninspiring slow paced cynical person. His sister is also not a very interesting person to watch. The dialogs are just average everyday conversations. If this movie gets an Oscar I seriously have my doubts about the voting system. Life can be an uplifting experience. The whole movie seems to portray that life is a long string of events to which you have very little influence and the only thing you have left to do is wait and sit out life. To me it is incomprehensible to take 12 years and come up with this very disappointing view on life and play it out so boringly. There is one scene that actually touched me. A plumber reflects back on a life's lesson he got from one of the main characters and how this positively shaped his life. Simply said: it is a waste to watch this movie."
BOYHOOD,5 January 2015,10/10,"I watched Boyhood yesterday.. And I thought it was amazing, it's amazing to see this little boy and his sister grow up in these 12 years and how there life changes every couple of years .. I thought its was an epic experience to watch this movie and I would imagine that this was so much fun filming it .. Patricia was amazing and Ethan as well but you would get bored a little watching this movie but that won't remove the feeling of how good this movie is . .. I recommend everyone to watch this movie and ignore the other bad reviews cause I saw a lot of bad reviews but there is also a lot of positive reviews ... Watch it and decide yourself"
BOYHOOD,12 January 2015,6/10,"Although completely personal, my opinion is that movies, despite the subject, should help you escape from life in some sense. Let you see beyond the veil of reality and wonder what can be shown when imagination as no limit, even if your dealing with normal things. Boyhood happens to do exactly the opposite. It grounds you in reality to a point it's almost unbearable. And twelve years in narrative feel like twelve hours of screening as you walk alongside a boy growing up into adulthood. Don't get me wrong, i think it's a good movie but not masterpiece most make of it. The premise of following this ""life"" around in real time almost, the continuous strain of dilemmas, the parents, the sister, the relationships, it just comes to show how dull life can be for most people. And thus lies the problem. Boyhood does not add anything. It just IS. It might be one of the most beautiful coming of age movies in recent years. But for most of us who've been through it, it just doesn't fill in the blanks. Been there, done that."
BOYHOOD,19 February 2015,6/10,"This is a good and fantastic movie that show the deep meaning of life and make us live the life of the character in the movie but unfortunately it didn't reach the perfection why?! because as i saw the acting was pretty awful and wasn't captivating enough and the script was suck and i think that the best performance in the whole movie is just Ethan Hawke the father of the boy. Back to the positives i liked the production, the shooting, editing and the sound they were very very good. i liked also the concept of watching a generation's hopes and struggles, presented on the big screen so in the end of my review i'll sat that the movie is good but not great ."
BOYHOOD,10 January 2015,5/10,"If you want some substance out of your cinema experience, don't waste almost 3 hours watching this Gerber's Baby edition of the Up Series. Boyhood is one of the most disappointing films i've seen, right along side Avatar. Initially drawn to the film by the New Yorker's review, praising it as one of the best films of 2014, I was so thoroughly disappointed by the end that I had to sign up on IMDb and write a review that no one will probably read. Honestly, 98% on RotTomatoe? 8.3 on IMDb? This should be Godfather material. But I digress. Plot: (Spoiler alert) Nothing happens. Nothing that you wouldn't expect, outside of the experiences of a middle class American family, 2.5 kids and white picket fence. The series of scenes were like an exponential build up of clichés. Each time something resembling a plot twist happens, the outcome always erred on the side of optimism, stereotype and simplification. Main Character:(Spoiler alert) We got the ""earnest supportive"" mom. She doesn't made a single mistake in the whole film, everything she does is for the greater good. 3 hours and you can't develop her character beyond that? We got the ""cool, artsy"" son. I saw him being angry exactly 1 time. He looks like he's on ambient or some type of downer the entire film. He has no visible emotional depth, besides a shy smile for the positive events and squeezing of the brow for the negative events. (no offense to the actor, I fault this to the script). We got the energetic sister who turned shy later on. I don't even know what else i can say for her. Nothing memorable happened after she performed the Britney Spears dance in the first 20 minutes. Support Character:(Spoiler alert) Each support character introduced is there to accomplish 1 thing and 1 thing only, after that they are gone. We never hear from them again. (Mexican home contractor is the exception, but even his reappearance was rushed and mechanical). We got the ""drunk abusive"" step dad, the ""homophobic tough guy"" former marine, the ""cool musician"" roommate of the dad, the two ""bully"" boys at school who appears for less than a minute to make fun of the son's gay hair style. I mean, really? Were these character's castings notes written over twitter? Summary: Predictable, lackluster, plot; underdeveloped, over simplified characters. If the film aims for pure entertainment, it fails as the subject/setting/characters lacks imagination. If Boyhood aims for inspiration, it fails because the movie paints the 2 dozen or so characters (minus 2) as unrealistically benevolent. If Boyhood aims to educate, I certainly have learned nothing from the stereotypical events as they unfold. The mom slipped out ""this is it?"" after the day her kid moves out of college, I can't help but feel the same way. I want my 3 hours back Linklater! (We're even since you also made Waking Life)"
BOYHOOD,13 January 2015,1/10,"This movie was very boring, pointless and an unfortunate waste of my time. I hate to say this, but the drunk stepfather was probably the most exciting part of this whole movie disaster. It made no sense and there were WAY too many loose ends! If I could give this movie a 0 then I would because I feel that 1 is way too generous. I feel like that 8.3 rating should be on a scale of 100. The premise of a 12 year project unfolding before your eyes just sounds absolutely mind blowing. I'm very disappointed that there wasn't more done with this movie. It had so much more potential to be more than it was, but it just never took off. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,8/10,"I can see why some people can find this movie too boring or too regular because this movie was in fact TOO NORMAL and that's what makes it so brilliant! It wasn't brilliant in Tarantino's action packed, fast paced, dark humor fantasy kind of way (And I'm a huge Tarantino fan) but brilliant in a ""too relatable, too real, eye opening"" kind of way. You know how in The Truman show, a show is made about a guy's everyday life without his knowledge? and as the movie progresses the audience (in the movie) is feeling pity for him and he is driving himself crazy with this mystery? Well, in Boyhood as we watch a kid's life progress on screen WE are the ones losing our mind and feeling pity for OURSELVES. Why? Because it hits so close to home! You realize how similarly we all live, how easy it is to follow a system and die pretending we did all we could whereas ""doing all we could"" should be living for ourselves not for expectations. Besides all this self actualization, the acting is amazing! Again, it's too natural. Patricia Arquette, and all her husbands in the movie were excellent, I still don't believe they were acting. (Yup, all of them!) I have watched many many movies where I walked out fantasizing of being a spy, a superhero, a ninja, a politician, a bounty hunter, a pilot, even a hit-man but after Boyhood I walked out wanting to be ME more than anything, and to me that an experience I didn't expect a movie to give me... I hope you all like it too :)"
BOYHOOD,15 January 2015,3/10,"Just rented this from iTunes today and watched it awhile ago. When Ethan Hawke asks ""what's the point?"" near the end of the movie I yelled ""EXACTLY !"" I think it was a neat idea of a movie but so darn boring I just wanted it to end. There was some good acting, but I could not relate to any of these people. I think the photography of the movie was good. I felt like I wasted 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. I know the critics have loved this movie but I think it's just because the director had such a novel idea to film the same actors over a 12 year period. I'm trying to come up with something more positive to add but just can't. My advice is go see an interesting movie because this one is not."
BOYHOOD,16 January 2015,,"No real stand out performances acting wise, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette bring the same solid acting performances that we've grown to expect of these veterans.They were perfectly casted for these roles. I can only imagine the scheduling conflicts they had to be overcome to accommodate this movies's filming. I actually disliked Ellar Coltran's character of Mason, a combination of modern day ""Quasi Emo and trophy child"" by the time he reached high school. However Linklater's unique vision to film this movie over the span of 12 years makes all prior cinema that have utilized multiple actors and/or terrible makeup to depict characters that have aged seem silly in comparison. For that reason alone this file is truly unique and a must see. I found myself re-watching the first 20 minutes of the movie after watching it in its entirety, just to appreciate how much the kids had grown and lead actors had aged...truly brilliant."
BOYHOOD,17 January 2015,2/10,"This has to be one of the most tedious films I have ever watched, which I think may have been the point. The idea is good, following the same characters/actors over 12 years. Also the acting, of Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, is extraordinary in their portrayal of ordinary people, and the reason I rate this with 2 stars (one each).But that's all I can see that's good in this film. The son, Mason, is oversensitive and lazy. The daughter, Amanda, is sulky and selfish, although her character is underdeveloped. The biggest issue I have with this film is, NOTHING HAPPENS. AT ALL. Alright so a lot of the life is about the mundane and the boring but I cannot imagine anything more dull than watching someone else's everyday life. Like Big Brother following the same people for 12 years. Boyhood needed something of interest to happen to reward the audience who invested over 2 and a half hours, and some money, in watching it. The best films are ones that have an effect on the viewer afterwards. The only effect this had in me was to bore me. It was am opportunity missed."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,10/10,"You will find that most people ether love it or hate it. Don't be fooled by the high IMDb ratings, my guess would be that 90% of the general population as opposed to IMDb movie buffs/film critics would be bored. If your idea of a thrilling 3 hours film is the $220m budget Transformers 4, you are going to hate the $4m budget Boyhood.I think most people who go to see the film will be intrigued by the idea of following a boy and his family as he grows up over a 12 year period with the actors re grouping every year for a few days to film some scenes. How was it executed: exquisitely. The acting was terrific as was the cinematography. The people who hated the film will complain that nothing much happens, that the family involved are utterly unremarkable and ordinary and that their lives just ebb and flow with ups and downs but no life threatening disasters or challenges. The people who loved the film will reply: precisely. The people who loved the film will mostly all point to different scenes that they connected with. The fact that there are so many masterful strokes to choose from is why they found it so gripping. The people who hated the film saw none of these. For me the very best scene was the ending, in retrospect how else could it end,but at the beginning, but you felt that he timed that moment to the second.So go and see the film and see which camp you fall into. If you fall into the ""love it"" camp, it will probably inspire you into valuable reflection about your own life. If you are with the ""hate it"" gang, well never mind, I'm sure Transformers 5 will be released any time now."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,3/10,"I understand the critics who value this film; it's 12 year scope is innovative, and I appreciate the intense reality of an average boy's journey through a fairly unremarkable life. Yet, that, for me, is the problem. My enjoyment of movies derives from their creative and imaginative storytelling. I'm engaged by a good tale, using form to encapsulate the plot-driven action. In addition, the characters need to be either extraordinary in an ordinary world, or ordinary in extraordinary circumstances--or both. In ""Boyhood,"" everything and everyone is just excruciatingly ordinary, and there is no particular story, except insofar as we follow a normal young man through his normal life. I know some people are captivated by such filmmaking, but I'm not; I felt bored and distracted. ""Boyhood"" didn't generate enough interest in the characters or their lives for me to care. Quite frankly, my life has been much more interesting, so sitting through someone else's plodding memories left me unimpressed."
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,8/10,"I have just finished watching Boyhood and I can just simply say that it is one the greatest films I have seen in a long time. The cast who portray the characters are excellent and play there roles superbly, one character I was drawn to from the out skirts and through out was Mason. Mason is a very relate able character in my opinion, especially if you are a boy of that age and have experienced the things Mason did throughout the film. It wasn't just the cast I enjoyed, however the story it self was pure film brilliance, the fact that it took the majority of 12 years to record makes this film an extra bit special. The best part about this film for me is how the film highlights the key landmarks and events of a parent's and child's life span together as a family. I would defiantly recommend this film to anyone!!!"
BOYHOOD,18 January 2015,4/10,"I usually understand why movie critics appreciate certain films, even if they don't happen to be my cup of tea. This one, though, had me shaking my head in disappointment and left me baffled by all the high ratings. Basically, I hated it. The only scene I liked was the one when Mason and his sister have to go to school with dirty clothes. That, and I also liked watching the actors age. It felt like a made for TV movie, too terribly long, incredibly unbelievable story line, and Mason (once a cute kid) turns into the most hideous looking teenager I've ever seen (not his fault, but still). It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time."
BOYHOOD,24 February 2015,5/10,"Firstly, excuse my English, since I am not a native speaker....I watched Boyhood and I watched boyhood on the weekend and was kind of not happy about it!I was kind of avoiding it, because I had heard so many polarized comments about it and I didn't know what to expect at all. Although I was leaning towards the low expectations side.My thoughts about it:Patricia Arquete was amazing! the first thing I could say about the movie was ""it should have been called motherhood"". I found Patricia to be the best character in this movie. Although I found her annoying and kind of weak and not smart at all at times; I think she was amazing in the role. I certainly felt like her character matured and learned things lots of things during the movie. The boy was kind of annoying. At times I felt like I was watching this kid complaint about everything, trying to figure out his life in a very simplistic and boring way  At times I felt like nothing was going on and I was making math in my head to count the years he was missing so the movie would be over something like ""if he was born when Ethan Hawke was 23, then he must be like 39 and wow! he looks so old to be 39 he looks like he is 50!"" and then I would go on like ""Patricia looks so much better than him now. he looks like he is 10 years older than her!!"" and then I would regain focus, and I hadn't miss anything about the movie, because basically nothing happened!!!! The sister was sooooooo so annoying!!! just at the opening scene there she was being this spoiled little brat, I couldn't stand her from the very beginning, this character was created with the sole purpose of giving the boy excuses to complaint even more! *** Spoiler Alert*** What's up with the mom's character? she would say ""hi"" to a man, and marry him!, I mean, could she at least try to be alone for just a couple of months? The sad part about this character is that it actually reflects the reality about many women who think the only solution to their problems is to marry someone who would solve them. It is a harsh and sad truth and it is portrayed very well in this movie. I felt at least a little bit of relief towards the end, when she finally realized that maybe the best option was to get rid of ""all the crap"", including useless partners, and live independently a simpler and quieter life.Overall, I had very low expectations, and honestly did not get why everyone was so astonished by it. Besides the fact the it was filmed during a long period of time, with the purpose of watching the characters get older I really do not think the story is entertaining, nor do I think it serves any purpose to the plot or the script at all."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2015,4/10,"The effort should be applauded but the plodding, too realistic, slice of a life over time, is boring and filled with unnecessary political commentary.I liked the way the scene with the girl on the bicycle unfolded as the dialogue and the kids came down the street. It was similar to the conversation Mason and his father had walking through the forest. Kind of meaningless to the plot but much like a real conversation can be.The movie was long with too few revelations and a great deal of pure life experiences that though refreshing were extremely mundane.The part where the ex-military guy said that his unit survived without a death while others perished was because of the ""mutual respect"" they had, as if it were the fault of the soldiers that were doing something disrespectful which caused them to die, not that they were caught up in a war and in a situation beyond their ability to control.Unique undertaking...boring, politically slanted result."
BOYHOOD,24 January 2015,1/10,"Contrived, poorly staged, totally fictional, several glaring errors (kid in darkroom in a digital photo class, etc.), uncomfortable to watch, way too long, lasted longer than my upbringing, poorly everything, great idea, incredible let down. Killed nothing but a couple of hours.Gee - looks like I must write several more lines to describe this cinematic debacle whilst it still runs before me. So much to say about nothing. A failure in every regard. Staged scenes whereupon cameras just happened to be where non-drama occurred. Imagine that. You will have to - like any crime scene, nothing to see here, move along."
BOYHOOD,25 January 2015,2/10,It was OK but there really wasn't a storyline. I mean I understand that it is about him growing up but it just seemed like it kept going and it really never ended. The ending was pretty bad also. What happens after that? What happens with his sister or mother or anyone?? Maybe they turn out fine maybe not no one will ever know. Not only that but it seems like it wasn't really the most intriguing movie ever. I was kinda into it at the beginning but as it went on it kinda just dragged and slowed down. Then to top it all off it seems like the scenes never really finish without going into them 20 years later. Of course that is an exaggeration but I never know whether it is the same problem as before or a new one until the scene is almost over. Maybe this is just not my type of movie but I have seen plenty and go into them open minded. I never just pick one genre. Maybe they could have elaborated on some problems more. Like what happened to the step kids? They probably should have added a little more to some parts and left out others.
BOYHOOD,26 January 2015,1/10,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, but the points I would give it is nothing out of 10. Everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness. Writing, acting, absolutely unconvincing, and you knew what they were going to say before they said it. I hope that is NOT the American way of life, because it's unreal. The word they use throughout the film is 'awesome' and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five. I would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede, it would have given me a great deal more pleasure. It is a film I wouldn't say is a turkey, but a massive pork pie, with plenty of jelly, even that sounds quite nice. I am always thoughtful about films, I love films, and the film that leaves the memory lingering is Jet Boy, a remarkable Canadian film, I would give that 8.5/10. If anybody wants to waste their time in totality, get this film for £10, remember, you have been warned. I put the film straight in the fire."
BOYHOOD,27 January 2015,1/10,"I checked the spoiler box just in case, but nothing happens, nothing to spoil, huge waste of time. Everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies, but I would highly recommend to STAY AWAY from Boyhood, this movie is terrible. It is filmed over a twelve year period, yes twelve, same actors and actresses. The movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours(2 hours of my life I will NEVER get back). I love all kinds of movies, action, adventure, drama, comedy, even a chick flick now and then, but this movie went nowhere, did nothing, and ended up like every other person in life. See it for yourself, but you have been warned. Cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations, other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crap."
BOYHOOD,3 February 2015,1/10,"This movie has received unanimous acclaim from critics, and is hugely popular with practically everyone else, and I really can't understand why. For me, it fails to do the one thing a movie absolutely has to do - entertain. It looks like a film studies exercise, a technical achievement for sure but not a film made with the viewing public in mind. For starters the near enough three hour run time is excessive to say the least. Boyhood is an unusual film that could end at any time during it and feel no less complete than the final cut. This is what is baffling to me, why couldn't they have started with Mason a little older? Or finished a little younger? It would still be as bland an ending as we ended up with. There were opportunities within the film to elaborate on some of the plot points that arose, for example the dinner scene with the lecturer as Mason's step-father and its aftermath, or in particular the all too brief part when he was confronted by a group of kids in the bathroom. Did we see how this affected Mason as a person? Did we see how he resolved the problem? No. It was completely ignored and we continued at the horribly slow pace which still relentlessly ploughs on regardless of any potentially interesting events that may occur. And finally, perhaps the most irritating part of this film, Mason himself. I can't understand why a film centred so heavily around a single protagonist would write a character to be so bland and unlikeable. He spends the first half of the movie watching the mundane, unexceptional world and people around him saying and doing nothing - I know he's just a young kid, but he may as well not even be there! The second half may be even worse as he goes from being a bland lifeless child to a completely unlikeable young adult! He talks like he knows everything about life which at his age he clearly doesn't, and makes a half-arsed attempt at becoming a photographer by going to college. Great. Nobody cares. Yet somehow they drag this out for as long as most other films last in total! Thankfully, the movie ends rather abruptly at this point. The movie may well be like real life, but why is that entertaining? For a film centred on one character's life to work their story has to be interesting or unusual. A film about an emotionless kid growing up to be an emotionless teen is as boring as it sounds. Linklater deserves the directing Oscar for sticking by a project for 12 years, and having such an original idea, but the final product has wasted three hours of my life, and if you haven't seen it yet I really wouldn't waste your time."
BOYHOOD,18 February 2015,1/10,"I'm always excited to see movies that aren't what most people consider your average already done Hollywood blockbuster but this was so awful I had to write just how much I disagree with all the praise this movie has gotten.The idea of filming a boys transition to manhood over 12 years of actual time sounds like a fantastic idea but I'm afraid that is really all this movie has going for it.We follow the main character through his childhood and teenage years. I don't know about you but at least for me those were the most exciting and sometimes heartbreaking times of my life. I can't really say why the director didn't want to show any of Mason's truly pivotal moments or his true emotions. He just shows us the truly mundane moments and expects us to be amazed at his originality. Sorry I wasn't in fact I was quite bored. Mason mostly sleep walks through the whole movie no real emotion about anything happening in his life, sure he cracks a smile now and again nothing like the true roller-coaster that is life.The other people in Mason's life are about uninteresting and one dimensional as he is. This movie is a one trick pony that doesn't even do that one trick well. Critics have praised this to the hilt which convinced me to see it. I sometimes disagree with critics but have never felt as opposed to them as I do about this film. If you can sit through this absolute snooze fest twice you really should get out more."
BOYHOOD,7 February 2015,10/10,"Boyhood – a review of the growth It is hard to describe the feeling after watching the movie- Boyhood. It is like a breeze that touches certain part of your heart, softly and subtly. You feel it, truly, but you cannot depict it concretely. The movie producing went through twelve years with the same cast. The passion and persistence of the director, the sponsor, and the cast in this movie is admirable, especially in such an age everything goes fast and few people would have enough patience to do one thing with twelve years. It is a plain story, no tragedy, no dramatic plot, no big hero, and no fancy scenarios. It is just about a twelve year life journey of a normal family in the Texas, a divorced woman with two kids, a girl and a boy. The lens recorded twelve year span of the life when the boy grows up from a little one to an adult. Weekend with dad and weekday with mom, I believe lots of people are familiar with this life when the divorce rate is approaching 60% in US. First beer, first kiss, first job washing dishes in a restaurant, first time heartbreaking in a relationship, first bible in the life given by grandma as the fifteen year old birthday gift, moving from a town to another town because of parent job change, leaving friends, leaving the house, leaving some old time when you even don't know what does it mean because you are too young. All these scenarios happen to someone each day, and remind us of the long period of time called childhood that we all have. What a time could the boyhood, or childhood be? Do you know what you want? Do you know what the world is? These eighteen years is full of dreams, joy, innocent, and hopes because the life is just starting, but also, full of confusion and frustration because of being too young to have the freedom and strength. No matter you like or not, everyone has to go through the childhood, and then grows up as an adult, moving out the house, leaving parents, going to college, starting another journey. The mom cries when she watched her younger son packing and moving out her apartment. She married three times, but unfortunately divorced three times. She has been longing for some private time to do what she wants to do, but when she has that space after kids move out, she feels lost. Isn't it the same thing that happens to all of us when we leave home to the adventure of the independent life one day? Twelve years, innumerable struggles and problems are encountered and then solved. Kids grow up, parents get old. No one can resist the fly of the time, and no problem can last forever as well. This is the movie, Boyhood, a movie belonging to you, to me, and to everyone."
BOYHOOD,15 February 2015,1/10,"I created an IMDb account because of this movie. It is the worst, dragged out, boring, try hard, words I don't think exist, garbage I've ever seen. Please give me my money and 3 hours of life back. When I'm on my deathbed in 50-60 (hopeful) years, riddled with dementia and Parkinson's, divorced 8 times with kids who hate me and nothing but an unmarked grave to look forward to, my biggest regret in life will no doubt be watching this film. I wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony 30 minutes in. I wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony strapped to a flaming 2 tonne anvil with a noose around my neck and 8 pounds of plastic c4 set to detonate on impact 1 hour in. So on and so forth. Why did I finish watching you ask? Well cause I was hoping, pleading, PRAYING to the holy Jesus lord above that this movie would get better, maybe have an exciting plot twist... Maybe just maybe NOT continue being a dreadfully boring and inconceivably lame story of a teenager and his regular as F**K life and then... WHAT, BOOM? ITS OVER!? AT LEAST GIVE ME A Micheal BAY EXPLOSION ON THAT BLAND CLIFF HES SITTING ON. That's it. I'm done. Not wasting anymore time on this horrible boring waste of my, according to this film, THRILLING life. Tips for watching this movie. Step 1. Wait for it to come out on DVD. Step 2. Take out massive loan from bank. Step 3. Buy all the copies you can of this movie. Step 4. Put all copies through wood chipper. Step 5. Burn with fire. Step 6. Cry tears of joy for being a superhero. Step 7. Weep tears of sorrow for all those who find this movie deserves ten stars, for I can't begin to imagine the excitement of a day in their lives."
BOYHOOD,16 February 2015,7/10,"After watching this movie, I did the most natural thing I could; I slept. It was with tremendous will power and goading on the part of my girlfriend to keep me from sleeping that I ever managed to reach the end credits in a single sitting. The greatest feeling of satisfaction it left me with was the knowledge that I had the fortitude to keep myself conscious throughout the entire film and that this was no small feat. I had erroneously taken the unanimous appeal of the critics as a sign that this was a groundbreaking, must see movie which would at the very least be an entertaining time, and maybe something more. Unfortunately, it was clear early on that it would be a chore to sit through the entire thing but I was determined to find out for myself what had caused SO many critics to so heavily laud this project.Firstly, I will talk about the more positive aspects of it. Front and center, of course, is the concept itself. Being the first movie of it's kind, and a hugely ambitious project besides I think is deserving of some credit and merit. The concept alone does not make a film though, and the execution was lackluster to the extreme.Besides the concept itself, the other bright spot of the movie is Ethan Hawke's acting and the writing for his character. Arquette is widely praised as well, but to me her lines often left many wondering if the film was improvised or if the editing process had been skipped. ""I'm glad you were born"" comes to mind immediately. Another incredibly cringe inducing moment for me was when she managed to make her son's departure to college all about herself, and in particular, her desire for more in life. For the most part, she just came off as narcissistic and whiny. This should be no slight against Patricia, though, because in these instances it is entirely the writing which is to blame.I think what we saw here was the critic community too afraid to not praise a mediocre movie because the concept itself was so ambitious and impressive. When it came to the plot, climax, and writing in general it was just boring and painfully long. I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a bad film, which is why I scored it a seven. It is just possibly the most overrated film of all time. Today, the morning after, I say scratching my head as I looked at the reviews and realized quickly most of these critics were giving empty lip service. Really, so it's a ""film of the ages"" and all you wrote was a few sentences on how cool you thought the idea of the film was? Most of the reviews I had read were as short and undetailed as the movie was long and bland. The first review I found on Rotten Tomatoes, for instance was barely a paragraph long and really only praised the concept itself. It is impressive to me that a movie could be filmed over 12 years and it is unique to watch someone actually grow up on screen and the actors who dedicated and committed themselves to it over this long period also deserve praise. However, to me, all this just makes the lack of actual delivery or something to really say that much more painful. Really, my best summary of this 12 year long effort was that it was a massive missed opportunity. I do give it the style points it deserves though, but if it rested entirely on the strength of it's narrative then C+ would be far too kind. When you keep in mind what this movie lacks, the concept itself comes off as novelty and gimmick.""What's the point?"" and ""I thought there would be more"" were the lines that resonated with me the most in this film, unfortunately, it was not for the reasons Linklater had intended."
BOYHOOD,18 February 2015,1/10,"The most boring movie I've ever seen. The concept of using the same actors over 12 years is a clever one. But the fictional story that goes along with it is utterly boring. On a relative basis it makes my own actual life seem like a dramatic epic adventure.I almost feel like I have to give a spoiler alert before saying nothing at all interesting happens in this movie. This is a fictional story and yet shows the life of a boy and family that is more or less the same as the actual boring life of millions of families. Thanks to fast forwarding I made it to the end, but I wish I didn't. My time could have been better used watching paint dry.How this movie has an 8.2 rating (at the time of this review) is beyond me. If you watch it anyway, consider yourself warned. And keep the fast forward button on the remote ready for use."
BOYHOOD,20 February 2015,3/10,"I viewed the movie last night and can honestly say that it didn't meet the hyped expectations at all. Some people have commented that the movie makes you feel as if you're not watching a movie, but actually living another life, that observation all depends on the fact that the life you're viewing is at all interesting, in this case it's like watching grass grow. I ended up not caring about the characters in the movie at all, to me there was nothing unique about a perpetual protracted script on the unexceptional, that's what I got from this movie. The movie should have been titled ""Banality"" that would have at least given me a heads-up."
BOYHOOD,25 February 2015,1/10,"What can be said? The reviewers who love this movie are entitled to their opinion, of course. But don't trust them. This movie is god awful. Only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting to see it, plus the rent one get one free coupon from Hastings, did it ever come into my DVD player. And if ever a premonition of a terrible movie came true it was with this tripe. Where to start.There is no plot. But this is just life you say. Yeah. And if I don't want to be entertained for the evening I will not rent a movie. I will just stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go by.But they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such B.S. as that. Did they? Who casted his parents? Who scripted his lines. What a hoax.This movie is so bad that when I returned it to the video store this evening and demanded my money back the staff, in unison, asked, did you watch ""Boyhood""? We are so sorry.This movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this site. Wow, I could go on."
BOYHOOD,1 March 2015,4/10,"The only interesting thing about this film is how it was created. Once that wears off you're left with a boring, dry, aimless waste of 3 hours. Acting was fine but nothing special. Assume that ALL the love for ""boyhood"" stems from not wanting to make people feel like they wasted 12 years on this nonsense, which sadly they did. From the opening scene the story (or lack of) seems forced with little structure, as it progresses I was left to think that's what the filmmakers had in mind. Many ideas are visited and dismissed with annoyingly abrupt changes and filler shots. I just didn't understand this movie."
BOYHOOD,2 March 2015,1/10,"This poor excuse for a movie disgusted me. Don't watch it if your a Christian, or someone who has any moral values. If you like boring/predictable movies and don't mind terrible language then have at it.Here is why if you really wanna know in a few short words. First off there really is no plot.The plot is not ""growing up"". That was probably the weak intention of the director. If it were life or death, I would say the plot is the main character (Mason) trying to fit in society along with his sister. However it seems Mason really only cared about his passion (photography). It is worth to note that the viewer never really gets a good picture of Mason's true intentions, feelings, beliefs, etc...Just FYI I'm 19 years young (born about the time ""Mason"" was) and I would say what Mason did/ decided to do (drinking, sex, drugs) is what SOME of my classmates did but I'm sure most of them wanted to do, but didn't.As far as the theme goes, I would describe it as ""it's cool to drink and to spew foul language out of your mouth"". Thats basically what Mason decided was the best method to fit in. Or the theme could be described as ""first world problems of stereo typical Athesists"".I really hate this film. It seemed to both condemn and promote drinking. Condemned it when it showed Mason out with his friends drinking at a young age (and at other times involving an abusive husband) and promoted it when the ""grown ups"" drank wine or such crap repetitively through out the whole freaking movie, as if it were OK and was cool to do so. A few last notes. Hollywood again managed to paint Conservatives as crazy murderous jerks and depicted liberals as sweet Obama-loving friends (in the short time frame when the main characters as kids were putting up ""Obama-Biden"" signs). A side note. I am a firearms enthusiast and I found it interesting that there was a scene (at an old couples house) with Mason, sister and their father shooting guns. FINAL NOTE. Mason, through most of the film shows very little emotion, and also seems as if he is high on something (I wouldn't be surprised). He walks around and talks slowly like some high addict! Lol!But seriously, Hollywood can go fall in a well. Screw this film and also ""Birdman"" (even though I do not plan on seeing it). The ONLY reason I watched (most of it at least...well unfortunately) was because my crazy mom (who seems to believe reviews of movies don't matter) thought it was a good film and my family had to see this ""work of art"" that took 50 years to make. BTW, I hated this film so much, I made my first account here and this is my first movie review.OK I'm done venting. Go see something else. PLEASE."
BOYHOOD,14 May 2016,4/10,"People talking that took 12 years to make People walking that took 12 years to make People running that took 12 years to make People laughing that took 12 years to make People crying that took 12 years to make There's no interesting stuff to be said about this film at all. It literally has NO other reason to exist. It just follows the regular, boring life of a regular jack-off kid as he grows up into a regular nerd teen. Nothing special or dramatic happens it's just a regular boring kid's childhood. The movie is given so much love and praise because it took 12 years to make. How impressive that they were able to keep calling back the same actors over 12 years!﻿ OH! In-case you don't know, Boyhood is a movie that took 12 years to make. It's also a boring piece of turd."
BOYHOOD,9 March 2015,1/10,"Why do we watch movies instead of living our dull boring lives? It is to give us momentary entertainment and allow us to dream of what we could accomplish if we are in the right circumstances and try hard enough. Boyhood is the gateway into the life of an average American boy, showing us... absolutely nothing. Basically, the only good comment this movie receives is that it is similar to real life and gives you the chance to watch the actors grow throughout the movie. That is it. This movie attempts to do something risky that does not guarantee success, but after all you cannot have a movie simply based on, ""You know how everyone's always saying seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kind of thinking it's the other way around, you know, like the moment seizes us."". For a movie to be successful you need a plot (which the movie does not have), good acting (which only the father provides) and originality (not the portrayal of an average kid with a shitty life and no skills at all). The only good thing you can see from this movie is the actors growing up and for that you might as well see Harry Potter and so it is with the utmost sincerity that I recommend you watch all 8 Harry Potter films and receive the entertainment you deserve."
BOYHOOD,15 March 2015,3/10,2:45mins I'll never get back. Don't bother starts off a bit slow then slows to a crawl for the rest of it. Then at the end having waited for something to happen it didn't. IMDb say you have to write 10 lines for a review sorry but this not possible as the film is just not exciting enough. Don't really know What else to say Except if you value Your own time Then give This one A miss It ma seem a little harsh but that's my view . The concept of the film being done over the actors and actresses lives is very good but sorry the concept is sadly better than the film. Sorry to witter on but I have to fill the review box with more dribble as I have not yet got to the correct amount of lines. Looks like I have now.
BOYHOOD,25 October 2016,10/10,"""Boyhood"" The film tells the story of a boy named Mason, who is trying to find his place in life. It starts with early childhood and ends with the hero to entering college. Speaking objectively, this is a common story of an ordinary American teenager with normal family conflicts and relationships. But this film - a special, it does not allocate a specific part of life, such as early or late adolescence, and did not fixate on a particular family problems, such as debt or divorce, he is constantly moving, the hero and those close to him people also grow and age, fall into more and more, although commonplace, but it is very close to our stories. They happen all the things that happen to all of us at certain stages of our lives. For three hours we go through the time-keeping as close to us sincerely situations and feelings that all their heart start to love the characters created by the author. This gives the narrative a special grace and brevity. We experience not point plan or stage we are going through a real journey with these characters. We live a lifetime with them. The bonus to this is a great cast and a charming soundtrack."
BOYHOOD,27 March 2015,3/10,"Two other members of the household and myself finally got around to watching this film on DVD last night. We give it 2 out of 5 stars for:The decent acting.Enough story momentum to watch it all the way through.Its uniqueness in having been filmed over a twelve-year period and watching the same two child actors grow up over that period into young adults.Other than that, the film was just plain anti-climatic and boring. It is basically a docudrama about a dysfunctional familial web of white Texans."
BOYHOOD,29 March 2015,8/10,"Usually events in films are so far from you, that you think like ""Man, It's so cool! I wanna be in his shoes"". But it's not the case here. When you are watching boyhood, you simply watch highlights from your childhood. Here we can see evolution of boy relationships with girls, friends and parents. Also Mason – protagonist of the film, trying to find the purpose of life during all his boyhood. With the years, his goals were changing and one day the moment to be set in life has arrived. We all did that. We all done that. Of course it brings some thoughts. Like that I've understand one important thing about adolescence - feelings are the same. Things, events, locations, people surrounding you might be different, but everyone's senses are the same. Film is overall about YOU. And that is completely amazing. It's hard to say that the movie is documentary or feature film. It's distillation of the both. There is no fantastic verses. Everything is as usual. Usual situations, usual fails and usual wins. Mason mother is collective image of all mothers, like mason teacher is all teachers both and mason friends too. Strangely enough this commonness isn't pushing away. On the contrary, it attracts you from early beginning to the end. It happened largely due to cast. There is nothing to say. Brilliant play.Film spreads you through 12 years epoch. There is so many things that influenced world at first decade of twenty first century. Electronics, fashion, politics aren't staying the same. All of this present in the movie. Also American atmosphere is strongly and clearly felt. It's a beautiful example of handing over the environment. Film crew worked very well all these years. Even in this boundary plot they found such breathtaking locations and new perspectives. There is everything as expected in the ending. One part of life ended, other part starts. But this ending wasn't made like a cap. It opens new horizons to Mason and you. Required to view. 8/10."
BOYHOOD,9 April 2015,1/10,"This film had great potential, but, in my opinion, was completely ruined by the insertion of overt political propaganda. Early in the movie, and irrelevantly to the plot, I was treated to harsh criticism of George Bush. I'd hoped this was just an anomaly, and that the director would resist further childishness and focus on the film. But, shortly after, I was subjected to swooning praise of Barack Obama, with the family members engaging in their civic duty to post Obama political signs, while stealing McCain signs. There was lots of gushing for Obama in the ""sign scene,"" but the director wasn't satisfied staying positive: one of the children asked if he could place a sign in someone's yard, and the owner verbally abused the child, going as far as to say he could shoot the child if he wanted to. Then, it was pointed out that the man had a confederate flag in his yard. I can only infer that the director wishes us to believe that anyone who does not support Obama must be an angry, racist, potential murderer.I was struggling to look the other way up to this point, foolishly hoping that something could be salvaged from the movie, in spite of the petty propaganda. Then, the father used the pregnancy of Sarah Palin's daughter as a ""teachable moment"" for his daughter, stressing how important it is to avoid unwanted pregnancy. At that point I gave up. An effort was made to get a refund, which sadly failed. I see absolutely nothing wrong with a director destroying his art with the inclusion of propaganda like this, as long as I don't have to pay for it (I don't, of course, and should have done more research before purchasing this movie)."
BOYHOOD,23 January 2016,1/10,"After this movie, in order to be a fair voter I had to rethink about all my other votes for other movies.Now this '3 hours of waste of time' is the only '1' voted 'movie' in my list. I mean there are excellent movies,good movies, average ones, bad and terrible movies but in addition to them there is this! Even the worst movie i have ever watched after this movie is a lot more better than this. The only achievement of the movie is to bring a lower level of evaluation criteria for film rating. There is not an interesting case in whole scenario, no drama, no feeling. Nothing special about anything for film making. I don't care how many years did it take to film such a bullshit; instead, I have expectations about quality of a movie in various ways. Even making a movie about someone's 12 years of lifetime is bringing so many expectations and possibilities about how a perfect story would it be. The change of the characters' mind, life expectations, perception of life based on the well integrated events that they experienced could have been the purpose of making such a movie. However what we see is displaying of a lifetime of a boring boy in a most boring way. It is a shame that this bullshit get such a high rating on 'imdb'."
BOYHOOD,23 December 2015,10/10,"I'm gonna start by saying that this is maybe the most extraordinary and inspiring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It may sound cheesy, and I'm only 18 so I haven't really seen many of the greatest movies out there. Anyway, I find it inspiring not only because it gives us the pure truth of our lives and the similarities between people all over the world, but because I believe every single one of us, who have watched the movie, can relate to it. I don't think there's any way any of us couldn't see us in the situation that the main character was put in. It's like so amazing, and the fact that it has been filmed in the course of 12 years it makes it even more believable and astonishing. Over all, from my perspective, this movie marked me and the first instinct that I had after watching it was to check forums and reviews of it. And also recommending it to my teenage friends so they all can feel that something that makes the movie so special that I felt. Definitely 10/10."
BOYHOOD,15 May 2015,5/10,"I've been a Richard Linklater fan ever since I saw ""Slacker"" nearly 25 years ago. I enjoyed his ""Before"" series. I've seen ""Dazed & Confused"" dozens of times. Same with ""School of Rock."" I really, really wanted to love ""Boyhood"" and was looking forward to seeing it. But I was very disappointed with the result. The only interesting thing in this movie is that you get to see the actors age over the course of 12 years. That's pretty much it. Nothing of interest actually happens in the movie.Nothing really happened in ""Slacker"" either, but where ""Boyhood"" spent 12 years following the same people and cobbling vignettes together, Slacker spent about 2 hours following about 40 people with no one being on screen more than a few minutes. Both movies are plot-less, but where ""Slacker"" takes you on a meandering journey meeting weird people telling weird and often very funny tales, ""Boyhood"" feels like watching a series of home movies.The infuriating part was that there were small plot threads throughout ""Boyhood"" -- the mother's efforts at raising two kids and trying to carve a career out for herself while often relying on a series of bad boyfriends/husbands to help her out, the father's dreams of being a musician only to settle into a regular 9-to-5 job, and the Mexican laborer who we see at the end managing a restaurant -- exploring any of those threads would have been much more interesting. And I think that's the problem I have with ""Boyhood."" I cared much more about the adults in the film and their stories than I did about Mason's failure to turn in a photography assignment or his first serious relationship.I didn't hate the movie. I just wasn't that impressed with it, and I don't understand the near-universal praise it has received."
BOYHOOD,24 May 2015,10/10,"I'll only say this: Boyhood is 100 times better than Birdman. Nobody I've asked likes Birdman. Boyhood talks about life and growth, bigger than any particular person. That's why it's great and meaningful.I thought the acting was fabulous, convincing and really true-to-life. Ethan and Patricia gave their best and most natural performance in this movie and the protagonist was very prominent in his career as a actor. It touched me deeply throughout and, especially, in the end. The message is subtle but profound and only the ones who have experienced life get it. It has nothing to hi-tech, visual effect, dramatization or costume design, but the day-in and day-out life we live in. Not too many movies can be better than this."
BOYHOOD,30 May 2015,10/10,One of the classic movie I ever watch.No doubt why it took many years to film this classic drama.Every character in the movie shows their best performance.The boy character in the movie is awesome.I went through a big life journey of Mason's while watching this movie.There is a flow through out the film.The most interesting part of this movie is that it filmed every particular change from a little boy to adulthood.The dad of Mason shows a good father-son relationship.There are many character's in this movie which helps in Mason's character formation.This film thought us how each character in childhood effects in character building of a person.Mason's life is unique.Every boyhood is unique.
BOYHOOD,30 June 2015,10/10,"I can easily say that Boyhood, is a masterpiece. I don't care that it took 12 years to shot it, it is just wonderful. This movie, is the life itself for many of us. Many reviewers are raving about this film asserting the lack of action. This movie is based on a fictional character's real life. Of course it won't have supernatural or extreme scenes. This movie has lots of reviews so I'll draw it fine. I'd like to share the two important scenes which are etched on memory ------------SPOILER ALERT----------1) Mason and her mother's talk before he leaves her to go to the college2) Nicole and Mason's talk in the valley at the end of the movie: You know how everyone's always saying seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kind of thinking it's the other way around, you know, like the moment seizes us."
BOYHOOD,21 July 2015,10/10,"Hmmm...""Boyhood"". So much mixed feelings about this one. Groundbreaking, it's the same cast over a 12 yr period. This is great idea because it makes the movie experience more realistic as you really grow with the characters and so much easier to follow the story lines. Speaking of the story, in my opinion, it is so so...as I don't know if anything about ""Boyhood"" was amazing or truly out of the ordinary. I felt like I was experiencing growing up like I was a Mason Jr. but it never really developed into anything other than some random moments in his young life. I can accept the fact that because they are filming over such a long time, a vibe could perhaps change several times through the course of the film (ie. Adolescence, puberty, teenage). The actors did not do a bad job, I just think the story never takes you anywhere. The feeling you are left with is melancholy at its best. If this is what the director wishes upon his audience, then so be it. Job well done. I give it 7/10. It's not horrible, it's not bad, but it is terribly regular, but it is what it is. Why it was almost 3 hrs long is beyond me but I watched it all so shame on me.****I updated my review as I got a better sense of who Richard Linklater is. Once you become familiar with director Richard Linklater, this movie will make a whole bunch more sense. The Texas scene and film in Texas in the past 30 years have a lot to thank Mr. Linklater for. Boyhood is excellent."
BOYHOOD,31 August 2015,9/10,"The protagonist of the story is a young boy, Mason. The whole movie revolves around events in his life from when he was a young boy of age 5 till he joined college at the age of 17. The key earmark of the movie is that it was shot over exactly 12 years and all the actors playing various roles remain the same. The movie tries to portray the life of a kid growing up and coming of age. The movie brings out how failed marriages affect the general well being of the children.The story manages to keep the audience engrossed by various ups and down Mason sees in his life while growing up. The movie is a treat to watch and brings an entirely new method of film-making into reality."
BOYHOOD,28 August 2015,4/10,"I started wondering when this movie would finally end. I lived in Texas and Houston for awhile and did not know the family lifestyle they focused on. Mostly dysfunctional liberals who cannot seem to keep relationships, or their lives together. The stereotypical leftist view of the aged Christian , Republican family of Jesus, guns and pie.It was Arquettes worst performance as an actress.A women ,mother,wife who leaned on men to enable her and totally detached from any relationship with her children.She finds men who are caught up in pseudo macho lifestyles. They are abusive, arrogant and self absorbed.Director Richard Linklater gave the impression this movie took years to finish.He took us from movie that did not mention modern electronic sand film developing to Facebook and smart phones. The lead actor who plays mason, Mason is a whiny kid who I would like to send to Alaska to a van to experience his call of the wild.I should have titled this "" Art not! link ""Later for this""Meanwhile the boring script keeps going and going !"
BOYHOOD,10 September 2015,8/10,"Many of those who have been accustomed to Hollywood drama will find this film completely empty and pointless, to start with. I am not surprised this picks up contrasted views, and below, of course, is merely MY view.My personal experience with American filmography was all about something different or sublime, special, dramatic, strong, etc. All the plots, close-ups, turnarounds, extreme characters, on and on... At some point I feel some fatigue from just too much spice in it.I much appreciated Boyhood because its tone and message are mild and sometimes vague and blurry. Not many people are quite sure of anything, or at least many things in life - but it just keeps going on. This film's way of saying it reflects the essence - not saying it at all and letting it flow.Even though it follows a boyhood of a kid of an unstable family, it doesn't exaggerate whatsoever yet keeps it so conveying and real I could identify myself with every each character in each instance and feel their breath. In that perspective I pretty much value the interpretation.Interestingly enough, I like most of my food unsalted."
BOYHOOD,24 June 2017,9/10,"I haven't seen a film like this in my whole life.It really describe whats going on when you're growing up.""But there's nothing interesting seeing that boy growing up and blah blah blah"" THATS WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE.You cannot find this kind of movie in several decade I think."
BOYHOOD,23 September 2015,9/10,"Look Boyhood is clearly not for everyone but to call it a gimmick is simply cynical. Linklater didn't just want to create a realistic coming of age story, he wanted to capture it on camera. Linklater has already made Dazed and Confused (one of the best films of 90s), Waking Life (one of the best films of the 2000s) and Before Trilogy (one of the greatest love stories of all time), so he's clearly a director with a unique vision. Boyhood is his most personal film to date. All the characters in Boyhood mature through the course of the film and they learn to embrace the darkness and imperfections of life. If you're constantly looking for ways to improve your future, you'll miss out on living. Ultimately Boyhood's message is that Life doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be lived."
BOYHOOD,19 November 2015,10/10,"Hi, its my first review and i just couldn't resist the stick this movie is getting from people. Everyone saying this movie has no point and it has no sense, now watch the last 3 minutes of movie pre-credits and you will get the point. its that we seize the moment or the moment seizes us. the journey is the best part of the story. the movie is beautiful that describes every major moments of Mason's life and that's the point. From 3 year old Mason to 18 Year old Mason describe the perfect way how a life, not a boy or a girl in particular, a life has many moments. it does not matter if those are good or bad moments, they are part of life that we are living. There is no joy without a little sadness and every moment counts. this movie is about moments and not the heroic or dramatic ending... i just wanted to share this and solidly recommend it. 10/10"
BOYHOOD,13 February 2016,8/10,"Never before has a film illustrated childhood as Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"". Using the same cast through out the entire film, ""Boyhood"" took 12 years – but what a splendid outcome! The audience literately see the main character Mason (performed by the actor Ellar Coltrane) growing up right in front of us. Not only do we see Mason's transformation from a 6-year-old boy to a young 18-year-old man. We, the audience also get a very unique insight in the life of a common, American family with both the good and the bad times. Sibling fights between Mason and his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), the children's first love, break ups, school life etc. Not only the children experience ups and downs, their parents (stared by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) feel the goods and the pain of life as well.The film is a wonderful and very interesting journey through childhood, boyhood and adulthood. It is about getting experience the tough way and getting fantastic memories and learn full lessons on the way. Great and absolute worthy to recommend. Watch it and recognize your own childhood. Another charming fact about ""Boyhood"".I give ""Boyhood"" 9 out of 10 stars.The film is unique and very interesting because of the transformation of the characters which is happening on the screen right in front of us. It is a bit long but 12 years of film compressed into three hours most be a challenge and the result is absolutely stoning."
BOYHOOD,28 June 2016,1/10,"This movie took years to shoot but it will feel like many eons to watch. It's cheesy, poorly written and profoundly tedious. I would sooner roll up a pair of flying pans and systematically insert them into each of my eye sockets before unrolling them and then allowing a swarm of wasps to inhabit my bloody eye pits! what was I saying? oh yeah, awful movie.....what not enough lines? OK. Boyhood is a cultural abortion claiming to be cultural and deep, I can't imagine anyone has actually sat through the entire movie, seriously, not even the director. I'm pretty sure the editor(s) of this movie may be dead by now, drowned, hanged or subjected to gravity from a height, just to escape the thousands of images of this boring American families first world problems. This movie is strait wack yo!"
BOYHOOD,12 July 2016,4/10,"This movie was quite simple. It does not have a general climax. It has nothing special. We can see 12 years of the life of a boy; it has many stereotypes, kind of clichés, like the typical 'evil step father', the young boy whose mind is different, the 'overcoming a breakup', the 'I want to be an artist though it is hard'. Also it has many USA habits, if you are not from USA it is annoying, at least if was for me.To make it worse: this movie lasts nearly 3 hours. I found nothing great watching Boyhood, I watched it because I read it was a 21st century must watch, which I can't agree, it is not essential.If you can skip this, do it; it's a waste of time."
BOYHOOD,9 August 2014,9/10,Boyhood is a film that goes through stages of life of a young boy all the way into becoming a young adult. Each moment in his life is filled with different experiences that have profound effects on his development. This can be seen throughout the entire film and it may become easy for some to relate to many of these experiences growing up and recall your own childhood through the lens of this young boy. Some may also start to notice how he is treated throughout the film and how it effects his daily interactions with others and how others are impacted by him. Every single main actor in this movie is dynamic and incredibly believable. Even secondary actors are often quite dynamic as well.This film does not follow a natural story arc. It is not a film where you are going to see lots of action scenes or be constantly wondering what is going to happen next. Its a film that portrays the ups and downs of life and is incredibly fascinating to watch because life is always changing. Boyhood is one of the rare films that I have seen that I know I can go back and watch again and again and still gain new insights with each playback.
BOYHOOD,12 September 2018,10/10,"An incredible story of a disassembled family, filming its 12 real years growth from when sons are kids to when they go to university, moment for moment in their life. It's a movie taken care in every small detail, nonpareil, one of the few that can be defined as art."
BOYHOOD,15 December 2016,1/10,"I'll make this quick since I've already spent so much time watching this movie. I have never been so upset with critics and celebs speaking so highly of a film before. I just kept waiting for something to witness or something meaningful to make me get it or relate with. Everyone is so dry and not interesting in the littlest bit. There was no story and no true moments. It's kind of when you are 11 and you believe you've written or drawn something that'll change the world. Years later you find it in a drawer and you find yourself slapping yourself and tossing it in the trash. The acting was beyond bad. There was no connection between the characters. The only thing I appreciate about it is the span of making it. Yeah, it's cool but you had ore than enough time to come up with a story! Something needs to happen to these people other than divorce and smoking pot and drinking. There is so much that could've been done to make this amazing. I like artsy- fartsy films but this has been a terrible waste of time. I put it right next to Marie Antoinette where it should be. I want my time back!"
BOYHOOD,10 November 2017,9/10,I am totally surprised that how could a project like this movie to survive. I feel it is like something real when I was watching it. I feel that I am living with the characters their own special details of their 12 years in just two hours. the girl acting was superb when she was a girl but not any more when she became adult. while the opposite happening to the boy
BOYHOOD,21 May 2018,1/10,Interesting concept and epic fail no lessons learned no heart no nothing. Oh what could have been....the mom and daughter try to
BOYHOOD,7 November 2019,10/10,Peaceful. Comfortable. Passionate. Empathize. Hopeful. Persistence. Touching
BOYHOOD,22 March 2017,1/10,"the most disappointing film ever. terrible. not original, whatsoever. It's just sad. so sad., so overrated...... ""doesn't contain a coherent plot so much as a chronological sequence of loosely connected vignettes. There's no thread tying it all together, no central conflict animating the characters."""
BOYHOOD,11 April 2017,10/10,"I literally love this film. The sheer love and warmth it made me feel towards the characters is something I haven't felt for a very long time.Linklater is said to talk of the film in very paternal terms, and this is exactly what comes through in his film making. I cared so much for Mason and for his whole family that the time flew by and the only thing I was looking to see as the years passed was that they were all doing well.Other reviews on here say that 'nothing happens'. I cant understand this at all- so much happens! I was so involved in their lives I didn't want it to end.If you like crashes and bangs and bright lights, this film is not for you. If you like to feel something during a movie, I cant recommend this highly enough, especially if you are a parent.(I realize this review is 3 years out of date, but I only saw it on the TV recently and felt so strongly that I needed to post!)."
BOYHOOD,21 August 2021,10/10,"I get it; it's not for everyone. A slow-paced, long movie with bad acting in some scenes. But to me, none of these flaws make the movie bad at all. Not-that-interesting plot? Sure, we watch a boy grow up. Simple, right? But I'd think that's exactly what makes this film so special. It is not trying to be anything but what it is. It's just so raw and beautiful. The family dynamic feels genuine, the characters look (and obviously age) real, the nostalgia is intense, the soundtrack is amazing. There are many subtle things in some scenes that reveal Mason's personality, like painting over the growth chart or his room in the first party scene. Also, the lyrics of the song played in the trailer and the last scene basically summarize Mason:
""I don't wanna be your hero,
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else""
Mason just wants to live his life and grow old without worrying about the future or his responsibilities all the time. He also knows how precious every moment he lives is. This film tells us to pay more attention to moments in between, rather than just big milestones in our lives, while not worrying about the future so much. In the end, there is a quote:
""You know how everyone's always saying seize the moment? I don't know, I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around. You know, like the moment seizes us.""
Yes, and we should let it seize us. As this film shows, time goes by so fast and life is so short."
BOYHOOD,10 August 2020,3/10,This review has a deeper plot than the movie. End.
BOYHOOD,10 July 2017,10/10,"In my opinion this is an excellent movie. It talks about ordinary life situations and problems. It's a realistic film that doesn't need extra suspense, melancholy or any other emotions. Looking a real growing up child with all the usual issues that a child faces by his life, is enough emotional. It doesn't need to evolve specific situations in which everyone experience in his life, just a look and a remembrance of feelings of it. At the end, looking how a mother closes her life chapters and opens the last one and how she feels abut it, also looking the abandon of the childhood and opening of the totally new life chapter for the boy, is the apex of the emotion that this film give."
BOYHOOD,16 August 2017,10/10,"Art is about life. Art is about letting you feel life as it was, as it is, as it could be, as it will be, as it should be... etc. This movie is about life. It's letting you feel life in a very real way. Life's about moments, linked to each other by time. In a circular way; nothing ever changes really. This movie is made of moments in time. This movie is the perfect form of art. Boyhood represents life, in its best way."
BOYHOOD,28 October 2020,9/10,Simplicity is very good sometimes. Just life passing by
BOYHOOD,10 May 2020,,This an amazing movie I watched from Richard Linklater's filmography. I love dialogs in his movies. All actors are acting very well.
BOYHOOD,19 May 2018,7/10,"Not at all bad and well worth a watch. The main strength is seeing children growing up and people ageing in the same film, which is remarkable. But that for me was also the weakness, in that it was trying to cover events over such a long period of time that it was very episodic, and not able to focus enough. You have to be on your toes to pick up the bits of dialog that tell you what's happened since the last installment, and I'd agree that parts of the script felt a little contrived. For me this would have worked better as a 10 or 12 part series, which would have done more justice to the material, and it could have been epic."
BOYHOOD,20 January 2015,9/10,"Over the years, I have seen many movies that deal with children and divorce. As a child of divorce, I find them over dramatized and mostly focused on crazy fights and the ""good parent vs. bad parent"" dynamic. In this instance, Boyhood was different. It wasn't overly done or forced, but felt like the story and sequences naturally progressed. It was spot on real life. The actors did well and I enjoyed seeing everyone grow up. I didn't always agree with the characters decisions at one time or another, but since the story spanned 12 years you can see how decisions impact them and how entire family changes. There is no villain or hero, just people doing the best they can what life deals them. It is a long movie, but I recommend it."
BOYHOOD,19 June 2019,1/10,"This was just a waste of time really, boring people living their boring life LITTERALLY and I'm not even exaggerating. If you watch this movie you will regret and think to yourself ""Damn, I should listen to this random guy's review"". Other guys reviewing this movie 1 star and ranting about the story are ALL RIGHT."
BOYHOOD,1 February 2021,9/10,"This movie is amazing, it just give you a story which contain some clasic cliché. Seeing the evolution of these kids makes me feel good about what I achieved until now. Theres a -1 because I feeled rushed between some scene change - I know it got ~150min of movie -, but I could watch another 3 hours of this, presenting suff like getting the GTO back, finish college."
BOYHOOD,21 August 2014,1/10,"This is the Emperor's New Clothes all over again. The movie runs two hours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years, and believe me, it seems like 12 years. There is nothing of interest in the film. It is about nothing. Nothing happens, except children grow up, parents grow up, children make friends, parents marry again and again. No drama, no humor, no sadness, no happiness.Just boring people leading boring lives, and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow, is just that, a gimmick. The boy of the title is a slacker, seeking meaning by doing nothing. Save your money, and more important, save your three hours and see another movie, any other movie."
BOYHOOD,22 May 2020,9/10,I wished I had watched it earlier so I could learn from all the conflicts in the film
BOYHOOD,17 January 2016,3/10,"I have to give a good credit to the director of the movie, all the patience waiting all this time to get the final result is something memorable. He also took a big risk with the characters, taking two kids and waiting to have good acting results from them every year must be frustrating. You may see during the movie some scenes with bad acting involved, specially in the teenager stage, a hard job for the director that, I think, should be recognized.But my valuation of the movies is still low, because apart of the real aging process of the characters during the movie, there is not a good story behind it to support the movie, nothing special and a forced ending. Seriously, if you make this movie with different actors representing the different times of their life, would you really will consider this movie as a great movie? To summarize, it's a creative concept but not a great result..."
BOYHOOD,15 January 2021,5/10,"The title and the score doesn't make sense one with the other, let me explain:
They all tried to make something deep, but there was something missing.The idea of using the same actors through 13 years it's impressive, but with so much time it's hard to focus on an objective, they almost lost the way in the middle, but they managed to follow the path and to deliver a good movie.The thing is, I felt like it should have choose different events in his life, maybe focusing more on the grown Mason, his years at university/college, maybe shifting, filming from when he was 10yo to 23yo.This film was something very big, I got it, there was lot of good stuff, but the end made me so angry, because of this waste of potential.
So yes, this is a rage vote.PS: Hero, Family of the year it's one of the best song I ever heard."
BOYHOOD,21 January 2019,1/10,"I literally created an account just so I could write this review. I wasted time creating this account, but it's nothing compared to the THREE HOURS wasted watching this movie. I would rather have been stabbed than watch this movie because at least stabbing has some action and emotion. Plus, I don't think a stabbing would've been that painful. I kept looking back at the TV, thinking ""is this still on??"" IT. NEVER. ENDED!!!! Please delete this movie!! It is unfair to subject the population to this! Please, show some compassion and delete it!!!"
