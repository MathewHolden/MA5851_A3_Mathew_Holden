BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,6/10,"Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clich√©d, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,"Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2019,5/10,"BLACK PANTHER is well known as the first Marvel film featuring a black superhero, well supported by an almost all-black cast. Whether it stands up on its own as a decent film is another matter, however. In fact, I found this quite sloppy at times, despite all of the effort and talent involved with its conception. I liked the idea of the hidden African kingdom well enough, although too much time is spent on set up and I think they should have just hit the ground running as they've done in other Marvel movies.The film is replete with action scenes, from hand-to-hand combat to a big car chase through the streets of Busan. The cast put in assured performances and can't really be faulted either. However, I was expecting more from the special effects, which aren't so special at times; the climactic scenes of the fighting rhinoceri reminded me unfavourably of the STAR WARS prequels at times. The writing is also a mixed bag, moving smoothly in Bond-style man-on-a-mission scenes but otherwise stalling, never quite achieving the gravitas it so desperately wants. It feels very much like Marvel knew they were taking a gamble with this one, so tried very hard to please everybody, but the end result is merely perfunctory."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,8/10,"To the outside world, Wakanda is a poor, isolated, reclusive kingdom in the center of Africa. In reality, it is a technologically advanced nation of five tribes through its use of vibranium from a crashed meteor. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to take over the throne after the death of his father in Civil War. He is after arms dealer Ulysses ""Klaw"" Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it's nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it's plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don't see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It's not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit."
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2020,5/10,"I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2019,,"My desire was to love it. I am not fan of Marvel universe, I am not admire the action films, I am loyal to classic mythologies. And I do not believe in the need of artistic films to be , in obvious and almost agressive manner, political manifesto. ""Black Panther"" has a virtue- the cast. In few cases - the performances. But its fundamental sin is the high ambition to impress its audience. And it does it. But not always inspired. It is an impressive film, no doubt. But, maybe writing the bad word, it is...too impressive. It is more an eccentric show than a reasonable film. Sure, it must be a blockbuster and I am happy for its succes to the young public. But, it could be better . Maybe because it has the right actors and the spider - story could be more reasonable. Off course, I am too subjective and too old for understand the noble intentions and the high virtues behind the each scene. But I feel it , with regret, as almost...racist film. Because the political corectness has its limits. This film looks to be an exception. It is not."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,6/10,"""Black Panther"" is a new American movie that makes it quite comfortably past the 2-hour mark and here we have the most recent addition to the Marvel universe as in the face of the topic of racism that is still oh so dominant (really more than it should be as we are living in very tolerant times) we get the first Black superhero movie in a long time. Ryan Coogler directs and he is also part of the writing squad. I would say that by including a main antagonist here that is also Black they took some racial tension out here, but if you look at the political history of America and the Black Panthers, it may not be the wisest move to go with this animal. Besides, I felt there was far from sufficient elaboration why they did. The dream sequence with the father being a panther now that he is dead alone wasn't enough for sure. Another slightly controversial decision that the main antagonist is an American megalomaniac was not the most sensitive either. But luckily, there are also enough positive things to mention here. Technically, the film is on a pretty high level in terms of sound and visual effects, there is no reason to say it isn't on par with other Marvel stuff from recent history. Also the film shows that you don't need characters from previous Marvel films to succeed the way they included Hulk most recently in Thor 3. And Boseman in the lead does a pretty good job like everybody else almost, certainly better than Cumberbatch for example. The one exception here is Kaluuya whose character did almost nothing for me and whose performance rang pretty false too on several occasions. The one who made up for that was Andy Serkis, who was great fun to watch and perhaps the best thing about the movie, one of not too many white performers here, who were mostly included for comedic (not entirely) situations. This description also fits Martin Freeman's role and he was the same as usual sadly, but luckily his material was good without being too challenging, so it worked. Not the Freeman you'd expect in this film though, is he?From the Black cast, a special mention goes out to Winston Duke who was really hilarious and makes the most of the little (screen time) he was given here. His cannibalism/vegetarianism joke was perhaps the best (recurring) joke the entire film had to offer. Michael B. Jordan was a good main antagonist I think, even if he seemed a bit insignificant early on, but that's okay. He sure is no Andy Serkis. The film's weakest moment was the epilogue that we got here the way we got it in every Marvel movie where we have the King tell the press that his country will no longer ignore global conflicts and this went entirely against everything before that as one of the key messages here was that they do not want to be involved while the bad guy wants to use the country's ressources to dominate the world. It was simply wrong. Obviously this was done so that they could include Black Panther in other upcoming Marvel films like the next Avengers movie, but probably others as well. Very cheap and if that's one of the things you remember the most when leaving the theater, then that is almost a negative deal-breaker. But luckily most of what we saw earlier was good enough, especially the shots at comedy that never felt as wrong or try-hard as in an Iron Man film (sorry RDJ), for me to still recommend the watch here. There are nonetheless serious issues here like the way the protagonist recovers so unrealistically quickly after his defeat and honestly this really felt like taken from Batman's conflict with Bane and he cannot defeat the bad guy at the peak of his physical fitness before that, but then he wins afterward after being in a coma recently? Nah guys. The female amazon tribe story added nothing for me either. So overall, realism, authenticity and convincing character elaborations are an issue here and the final scene in America about that apartment felt really try-hard in making a political impact and the film is never as touching or politically relevant from the contemporary perspective as it wants to be, but it is like other recent Marvel films okay from the pointless fun perspective. I give it a thumbs-up. Worth checking out, but not a must-see by any means."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,6/10,"Marvel Films have their formula down to a fine art. Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it. It is something Marvel Comics has tackled from its early days.A well mounted, good looking action film but it lacks substance. The box office figures are shocking. It is good but not that good."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2019,5/10,"""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla¬¥s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'√©tat, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,,"This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,9/10,"In this film we get the background to the Marvel character Black Panther. It includes the expected cameo from Stan Lee (craps table) and the climax battle. In order to become king, Chadwick Boseman had to fight a Mr. T looking guy and then he is given gadgets that would make James Bond envious. Worshipers of Bast will certainly be delighted. Good action film. The media has hyped this film as some sort of African-American statement of.....I am not sure what. It wasn't as preachy as I was lead to believe and certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know about society or history. The comedy was scarce and the film was not as entertaining as Iron Man (what was), but is worthy of the Marvel Series."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2018,3/10,"I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, no new ideas, no originality, it felt like a B version of Wonder Woman.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears."
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,8/10,"Actually that is not entirely true, because you can go back. Then again that would not rhyme with Panther anyway. And not you as in you but Chadwick who ... well you'll know what I mean once you've seen the movie. But back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I am really still surprised that people who loathe what Marvel has done, go and watch the movies and just see what they already made up their mind they will get served in the first place.I'd say this has an original take to it. I do understand if you say they feel the same to you. If that is the case, don't bother watching them. Also I'm still surprised there are people out there who still haven't figured out there are stingers at the end of the movie. During and after the credits - stay tuned folks. Now another small incident that I witnessed that occured was when a couple came out of the movie an hour into it and upon me asking them if they were alright, they said they didn't like the movie. Fair enough, we all like different things. Someone else asked them why though ... and their answer was that it was racist and cliche. Two white people claiming to know what black people think? Yep that surely must be the wrong side of ""woke"".Enjoy a movie that is more than just a movie. It was made and became a phenomenon. Now besides the ""Tolkien white guys"" (a joke that was made on set apparently, according to one of the two white guys in the movie, Martin Freeman), this gives us a movie made under the helm of Marvel but creatively they put a lot of trust into their director. And this was something that touched a nerve in the public - rightfully so. Because apart from having a predominantly black cast (and director), this also is a very entertaining and good movie.The movie itself gives us a closer look behind the mythology of the Panther. And it is quite interesting. There are a few hiccups along the ride, but the movie works overall. And it adds to the ""universe"". Those movies are supposed to be light and fun ... but they still can carry a small political message. Both are not mutually exclusive"
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2018,8/10,"When I read the reviews of these super-hero movies I begin to wonder what the haters expect. Even with the film's generally high rating, a lot of the individual reviews bash this film for whatever reason, whether it's the story line, the CGI, the acting, take your pick. For me, it was a super-hero action flick that served well in that capacity, even if some of the elements are derivative of other sources. Certainly the costuming and cinematography is expertly done, and the character motivations are developed well enough to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. If there's a bone to pick it's with the screenwriters, I would have preferred less of the modern day tendency toward globalization that the picture fosters. Though the villain Erik Stevens/Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) made a compelling case for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the rest of Wakanda to share their wealth, knowledge and resources with the rest of the world, I didn't see it as their obligation to do so. But the irony is, after all the fighting, death and destruction, T'Challa eventually wound up coming around to that side of the argument, which made Killmonger a martyr for no cause. Once again, it was good to see Black Panther creator and Marvel Comic guru Stan Lee in a spot cameo as a casino patron in South Korea. The credits list him as a 'thirsty gambler', which makes it sound like he was some kind of lush but it didn't appear that way in the picture. I think my favorite character in the story was Letitia Wright's Shuri. She was smart, feisty, and dedicated to her brother and her country, and it didn't hurt that she looked like someone I know. A remarkable resemblance actually, and if I didn't know better, I'd think that Black Panther might live right down the street from me."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,9/10,"I had never heard of the Marvel character Black Panther before the movie got released, so that made it even more of a surprise. What an experience. I don't think that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but it's to see a superhero movie unlike the ones that we're used to seeing. Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis put on some impressive performances, and I especially enjoyed hearing all the different languages spoken. With any luck, ""Black Panther"" will lead to a more complex focus on Africa in cinema in the coming years."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,7/10,"The leading hero of this next instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War, his solo movie is seen as an important superhero movie, opening the door to black leading heroes, directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed). Basically centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing vibranium, one warrior ingests a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first ""Black Panther"". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and pose as a Third World country to isolate themselves from the world. In 1992, King T'Chaka (John Kani) visits his undercover brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri (Denzel Whitaker), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. In the present day, following the death of T'Chaka, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne, and to become the next Black Panther. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover from an undercover assignment, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) all attend the coronation. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat, T'Challa defeats M'Baku and convinces him to yield rather than die. After Klaue and Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) steal a Wakandan artifact from a museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), a firefight breaks out and Klaue tries to escape, T'Challa catches him, he reluctantly allows Ross to take him into custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization, Erik attacks and extracts Klaue, Ross is severely protecting Nakia, T'Challa decides to save Ross rather than pursuing Klaue, taking him to Wakanda. While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri (Forest Whitaker) about N'Jobu, Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world and take it over. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him, they covered up the fact that they had left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, who became a U. S. black ops soldier. Meanwhile Killmonger, aka N'Jadaka, kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda, he stands before the tribe elders, revealing his identity and claiming to be the true heir to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest are incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first, supported by W'Kabi and his army, Killmonger prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross go to the Jabari Tribe for help, there they find T'Challa who was rescued and is in a coma, he is healed by Nakia's herb. T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the vibranium weapons, M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down, T'Challa fights Killmonger in Wakanda's vibranium mine, Killmonger's suit is disrupted and T'Challa stabs him, Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri, and T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits sequence, Shuri is with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who is in recuperation. Also starring Florence Kasumba as Ayo and Stan Lee as Thirsty Gambler. Boseman is a good choice as the hero, Jordan is a fairly good villain, and there is great support from Wright, Gurira, Serkis, Freeman and others, most putting on convincing South African or American accents, the story is maybe a little complicated at times, but there enough exciting chase and explosive sequences, filled with fantastic special effects, to keep you engaged, and it is also a good exploration of African culture, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Original Score for Ludwig G√∂ransson, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for ""All the Stars"" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score. Very good!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2018,6/10,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2018,,"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,9/10,"What does empowerment mean for black people? While this is not exactly the central question for T'Challa, there is a part of this question for him. He has to not only be a king but know how to do it. Does he stay an isolationist, clinging to the world he was raised in and all of the vibranium included, or share the knowledge and tech with the world? Information and resources, wealth, science, that leads to people becoming empowered because they have what they didnt.This is in direct contrast with another kind of empowerment, through dominance and wiping out oppressors, and that is what Killmonger represents. But does he come from some place that is inhuman? Not really; Eric is from a world of pain, of heartache and loss, and by how he decided what made the most sense - getting jacked and becoming a super-soldier (no, not that one, sans what Captain America's got) - it charted how he saw becoming a ruler. Can one become empowered through revolution? It's arguable, and that's the key thing. ""Kill white""? He wouldn't be the first, or the last.But Killmonger (what a name) is the villain when all is said and done because he doesn't see change being possible in others, whether white or black or whomever. All he sees is the chaos and anger of the world, and sees it as a personal struggle. I didn't see it right off on the first viewing until Double Toasted in their review pointed to it, but there is a stark Trump parallel one could make with Jordan's character.... Though with a bit more of the Malcolm X and less of the, you know, white supremacist side. But then again, supremacy is supremacy and so is demagoguery.These sound like some heavy concepts for a Marvel movie and they are, but the brilliance or Coogler's movie is that he smuggles (or it may just be out in the open and direct) in an action-filled spy epic with Shakespearean overtones (and all the soap-opera that comes with Mr Shakespeare and his royalty epics). This doesn't mean it's without some flaws, both technical (there's some poor CGI in the third act, and in other parts too, though not all bad), and in the plot (mostly in some familiarity with Winston Duke's character, though he fills him with personality to burn). I'm not even sure it hit me emotionally as Civil War or Iron Man as far as Marvel movies go.But as far as movies I've rated a 4.5 out of 5, this is one of the better ones. It has a lot on it's mind, and it has a great way of bringing these ideas to the largest possible audience - not to mention, with both race and gender representation - it's the most woke movie ever made."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"This review replaces my original one from a few days ago when I said I wasn't as impressed with this one as the other Marvel movies. I also said I didn't think Chadwick Boseman was as impressive playing T'Challa as he was previously when playing Jackie Robinson or James Brown. Since I didn't sleep this time when watching this a second time, I can now say that Boseman was indeed as good, maybe even better, here as when playing those real-life public figures. And since I also now understand why the events happened when they did, I think this is as good, maybe even better, as those other Marvel movies made by that studio for the last several years. So that's a high recommendation of Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,,"This film tells the story of a super human who helps the prince of an African nation to succeed in the throne, and helps to prevent a war from breaking out.It's refreshing to have an African superhero, and even more refreshing to have a film that incorporates a lot of African cultural and ethnic elements. I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well. It is a great blend of enough elements and futuristic elements. There are also plenty of rises and falls in the plot to engage the viewers. The visuals are great as well. I really enjoyed it."
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2020,7/10,"This is quite a tough film to review objectively; at times it is as good as any from the comic-book universe; the cinematography and effects are top drawer and the pace of the action is usually well judged and enjoyable. The writing and the acting, on the other hand, are a different matter. Chadwick Boseman as ""T'Challa"" is about as wooden as they come as he returns to rule his outwardly agrarian African nation (""Wakanda"") that secretly has some state-of-the art kit based around a rare, but enormously powerful mineral from outer space. In this particular outing he isn't much helped by Martin Freeman (""Agent Ross"") or Forest Whitaker as the sagely ""Zuri"". Letitia Wright injects some charm as his tech-savvy little sister ""Shuri"" and for a bit at the beginning, Andy Serkis hams up nicely as South African arch villain ""Ulysses Klaue"" (pronounced claw) but once it settles down, it becomes a beautifully shot but rather bland, simplistic right vs wrong, do the right thing type of story. I do like Michael B. Jordan (""Erik"") - here he has a screen presence that is charming, cheeky and he knows how to work an audience - and I have to say I was on his side pretty much from the outset, but sadly though, the ending is never in doubt and with neither suspense nor jeopardy to sustain it's initial promise, ""Black Panther"" just ends up being a great looking, but pretty shallow festival of colour and CGI."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,5/10,"A groundbreaking magnum opus of cinematic marketing for African-Americans, ""Creed"" director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" (** OUT OF ****) has demonstrated the impact that a film can create when a single demographic embraces it. The 18th Marvel Studios superhero saga has coined over a billion dollars. Apart from the R-rated Marvel Comics ""Blade"" trilogy, African-Americans have waited patiently for a suitable larger-than-life champion with a PG-13 rating. A largely derivative but a polished escapade from start to finish, ""Black Panther"" amounts to a standard-issue, Panther malice-in-the-palace melodrama. The generational gap in the skewered relationship between father and son in director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's screenplay provides this epic with its most thematically compelling material. The son spends most of his time handling the mistakes that his short-sighted father has made. The secret fantasy kingdom of Wakanda shares some similarities with the clandestine island in ""Wonder Woman."" Basically, ""Black"" constitutes an origins story about a hero in a cat-suit with ears and his homeland. Mind you, this isn't the first time Black Panther has graced the silver screen. He made his debut in the contrived and drawn-out ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) where the Avengers broke ranks and swore loyalty to either Captain America or Iron Man. Chadwick Boseman exhibits the steadfast confidence and physical agility to play Marvel Comic's first African-born superhero. Unfortunately, since he is not only a king, but also a politician who symbolizes the status quo, he seems hopelessly bland and straightforward. Boseman needs to jettison the pseudo-African accent that he uses as Prince T'Challa because it sounds synthetic. Comparably, Michael B. Jordan emerges as far more appealing than a ruthless adversary should. As an illegitimate ghetto offspring of Wakandan blood, the charismatic Jordan spouts the minimal number of profanities allowed for a PG-13 rating. Similarly, the dynamic women who surround Black Panther as his elite bodyguard are far more exciting than the ruler they shield from danger. For the record, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created ""Black Panther"" in 1966 when the character debuted in issue # 52 of first volume of the ""The Fantastic Four."" The film ""Black Panther"" opens as a narrator explains that long before mankind arose, an enormous meteorite crashed into the jungles of Africa. The five tribes of Wakanda would eventually gravitate around the crash site. Described as ""the strongest metal in the universe,"" the vibranium in this meteorite drastically altered the composition of local plant life. The Five Tribes of Wakanda fought without closure until the Panther goddess Bast appeared in a vision to a shaman warrior. Four of the tribes lived together, while the fifth took up residence in the mountains. This warrior found a 'Heart-Shaped Herb' that endowed him with superhuman strength as well as speed. He emerged as the first Black Panther. Meantime, the Wakandans excavated vibranium and forged technology as well as weapons far beyond anything else on Earth. Paranoid that the world would plunder their secrets, Wakanda guarded it jealously and withheld it to keep foreigners from exploiting it. Earlier in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the Wakanda King T'Challa died in an explosion at the United Nations in Vienna, and his son set out to find the killer. If you've seen ""Civil War,"" you know the killer was none other than James ""Bucky"" Barnes, aka 'The Winter Soldier.' Barnes reprises his role in an end credits cameo for anybody with the patience to stick around and watch it.Sadly, despite their best efforts to conceal the vibranium, the Wakandans fail. A colorful but cruel arms merchant, racist Afrikaner Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis of ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron""), and a renegade mercenary Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan of ""Fantastic Four"") shoot up a British museum and steal an ancient Wakandan ax containing vibranium. Our hero T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman of ""Get on Up"") pursues Klaue, but 'Killmonger' beats our hero to the villainous Afrikaner. Meantime, T'Challa satisfies all the rituals before his coronation. He must submit to any challengers who want to fight him for his monarchy. Of course, nobody confronts him since they respect him. As their new King, T'Challa learns about the dreadfully unfair demise of his father's brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"") and his ghetto-born son. 'Killmonger' challenges T'Challa, and they slug it out in a pool located atop a perilous waterfall. T'Challa appears to finally have met his match, but 'Killmonger' lets him escape. Plunging into a deep gorge where a torrential river flows, T'Challa vanishes from sight. The authorities proclaim 'Killmonger' the new Wakandan king. His first imperial act is to share vibranium with other Third World black countries. Of course, you know 'Killmonger' cannot get away with this perfidy. Predictably, T'Challa may be down, but it isn't entirely out of the picture.Our hero need not worry about hasty last-minute costume changes. He wears a necklace that deploys his black, one-piece outfit and activates all its myriad capabilities. For example, if you strike him, the suit channels the energy in reverse, and the assailant suffers blowback. The Wakandans boast an incredible arsenal of futuristic weapons. James Bond would envy some of these Wakandan gadgets. At one point, they save an American CIA agent, Everett K. Rose (Martin Freeman of ""Hot Fuzz""), from a devastating spinal wound that would have confined him for life in a wheelchair. English actor Freeman seems woefully miscast as an American. Coogler stages some modest action scenes. Nevertheless, everything about this formulaic adventure remains so by-the-numbers that you can guess the outcome. One of the more interesting characters, Andy Serkis' Klaue, is probably the liveliest, but he gets his comeuppance about half-way through the heroics. You won't be able to take your eyes off Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira. Altogether, ""Black Panther"" ushers long-overdue diversity into the Marvel Comics Universe, but this promising superhero pales by comparison with Wesley Snipes ""Blade"" for sheer bravado and derring-do."
BLACK PANTHER,1 October 2019,7/10,"Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie. Great action, great acting, and some good ole arse kicking. A superhero for the modern age, black panther gives us all the vibes. The ladies keep it real, redefining what it means to be a supporting role, and taking up arms in killer action scenes. I also quite enjoy a bad guy who is relatable and toes that line. Michael B. Jordan really shines as kilmonger, he makes the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,10 November 2018,4/10,"After the death of his father, Prince T'Challa ascends to the throne of the small African country of Wakanda. T'Challa is also Black Panther, superhero. Now not only must he govern his country but defeat a dangerous adversary.An average comic book / superhero movie, which doesn't say much. Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"I could say Marvel does it again or I could say Marvel outdid themselves and both would be true because Marvel regularly produces hits. They are the Elvis, the Michael Jackson or The Beatles of cinema. Even when a movie receives much hype, such as this one, they still live up to the hype.I had Black Panther circled on my calendar for months (even before I knew the release date). I'm not a Black Panther aficionado, but likewise I was no Iron Man, Blade, Avengers et al aficionado yet I loved those movies.Black Panther was excellently done all around: the story, the acting, the action and the atmosphere it looked like time and effort was put into it. Everything looked authentic. I appreciated the atmosphere more than anything. Set in the fictitious land of Wakanda, hidden in the heart of Africa, it had such an authentic feel. They were able to portray this beautiful African nation in a way that showed it's difference from what we're but showing it in a dignified respectful manner. The scenery, the people, the atmosphere didn't look cheap, gimmicky or like a caricature. They came off like real people from a real culture.And the story was layered and complex. It wasn't simply revenge or lunacy and it definitely wasn't black and white. There were some real ideological issues and battles in there with no right answer. Of course the action sequences were on point but that's to be expected. I'm just thrilled that it lived up to the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"T'Challa(Boseman, charismatic, not mistaking considering issues for being indecisive) returns to his homeland of Wakanda to succeed his late father as king after the latter's sudden murder. Will he continue the way things have worked for centuries, or go down a different path? How does one best aid one's own people? And does that extend beyond your nation's borders? Can he stop Killmonger(B. Jordan, passionate, wrong only in how far he goes and not in what he seeks to solve), before he tears the country apart from within?This shares a lot of traits with The Wonder Woman solo movie. It's about time that they are made. but being filmed now, they can use recent events, and the franchise they belong to, to great effect. They celebrate, not excuse, not mock, not downplay, the traits typically thought of as natural, or even culturally, historically, geographically, important to the minority that they're about. They're telling a story important to that group. Exploring themes specific to them. Presenting a fictional, powerful country, where they are in charge, they are the rule rather than the exception, and govern by their strengths. And now to get into what separates this from the Gal Gadot-led picture, and I'm not saying that movie could have, or should have, done this, as it is, intentionally, a different story. That is about a woman on her own, in a world dominated by men. This is fully immersed in African culture. It is relevant to black people in the US, and all over the world. But it's not about immigrants, or their descendants. Which is not to say that it's snobby. Free of the pressures of the majority of the population who are distinct from them, never made to be ashamed of who they are, The Five Tribes do have all the power that their kin continue to fight for as they have for hundreds of years. In fact, far more than that. And so, it asks, how do you use that? What makes a great leader?All the visuals are dazzling. Costumes, sets, designs, cinematography, etc. The acting is great. Shuri(Wright, infectious smile, casual, a brilliant engineer) steals every scene she's in. Coogler, known for drama, of course handles that aspect with a deft hand. And unusually for a first-time Blockbuster director, also the action, scope and massive budget. A little of the coverage and editing is awkward, showing his inexperience. but that is barely noticeable. The James Bond meets The Godfather feel blends the classic with the ultra-modern perfectly. The ancestral plane seems made for going into father son relationships. The War rhinos(!) Are an inspired touch. This is full of black women. They aren't looked down on, or angry side-kicks. Several are serious bad-asses. They give the protagonist advice, from their different perspectives, and he considers all of it. My only real complaint is that this did not take the final step in making this completely accessible for those unfamiliar with the MCU. If you did not watch the film that introduces the Black Panther, you will not understand, as this does not retell, what happened after the explosion that hits the UN. And since going blind into that film is even more confusing(If you watch Age of Ultron before it, you can follow it no problems... but not everybody knows that), that means this can't be watched by everyone. So I urge you. If you didn't already, catch those two films first, then go see this . Obviously, not everyone has, or will, see all 17 leading up to this.There is some violence and strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. I give this a perfect rating not to even out the overall score, a practice I do not believe in, but because it deserves it. I reserve that for only the best. I give it rarely. And I am thrilled to award it to this. 10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"BLACK PANTHER (2018) *** 1/2 Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis. Marvel continues to be marvelous in their latest franchise addition with Boseman oozing charm and stoicism as the titular hero and African king of the fictitious Wakanda, who faces his new empire with the imposing threat by Jordan's menacing, vengeance seeking cousin hellbent on using their nation's natural resource - vibranium - to expose their country's secrecies to the world. Filmmaker Ryan Coogler - who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole - spreads his canvas with bold color, sharp designs and eye-popping visual effects and set pieces (the car chase is a humdinger) and wisely allows his supporting cast - namely the trifecta of actresses Nyong'o as the smart, sexy love interest Nakia; Gurira (bad ass all the way) as Okoye the lead warrior of T'Challa's kingdom and scene-stealer/secret weapon Wright (funny, bright and sharp as a tack) as his kid sister and Q to his Bond, genius tech inventor - to in many ways overshadow the lead yet steer him steadily into battle. Geeks will be all giddy as well to see an onscreen reunite of Gollum and Bilbo Baggins (Serkis and Freeman, respectively as a villain and FBI agent/comrade to the King). Kudos to Ludwig Goransson's royale score and Ruth E. Carter's majestic costumes. All hail!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2018,7/10,"I violated my own embargo on super hero movies in order to finally see what all the fuss was about.You see, I had decided never to watch another super hero movie because....well, because they all suck. But praise for ""Black Panther"" was over the moon, and people were specifically saying that it broke the super hero mold and gave us something unique and reflective of our times. To which I say....""Nope."" This is just another super hero movie, and it follows all of the safe, bland super hero movie conventions.I do appreciate that the film is driven by African American characters and themes, because Lord knows if any genre needed a dose of color (or estrogen for that matter), the super hero genre was it. And I also appreciate how the film uses a super hero movie setting to explore questions of black identity in the larger world. But folks are giving it way too much credit. I was actually shocked by how poorly directed the film was, especially the climactic battle scenes, a hot mess if ever there was one, and how terrible the visual effects were. The film looks incredibly cheap.And it's all just so silly, which is how I feel about all super hero movies. In super hero world, everyone wears ridiculous costumes and speaks in formal, portentous accents, and says things like ""vibranium"" with a straight face. This movie, like others of its ilk, would do well to plant its tongue a bit more firmly in cheek. No, ""Black Panther"" benefited from timing. It was the movie people needed in the cultural moment, and I think audiences were seeing what they wanted to see in it whether it was really there or not. But divorced from that specific cultural moment, the film doesn't seem like anything special. Grade: B"
BLACK PANTHER,19 October 2018,8/10,"This film essentially begins in ancient times with a meteorite composed of an incredible metal known as ""vibranium"" crashing into an area of Africa which is inhabited by 5 different tribes. Eventually, 4 of the tribes join together to form the nation known as Wakanda and use this new metal to advance their technology beyond anything the world has ever known. Equally important is the fact that a rare herb grown in that part of the world has been affected by the radiation from vibranium and, when ingested, gives a person superhuman abilities. This person is known as the Black Panther and he not only becomes the King of Wakanda but also serves as the protector for his people. Anyway, thousands of years pass and while the rest of the world advances Wakanda remains in geographical isolation and is thought of as an extremely backward country. But little does the world realize that Wakanda has technology beyond that of Western civilization and has chosen to remain isolated for fear of what might happen if their technology-and most importantly their vibranium-were to get in the wrong hands. That being said, when some vibranium is stolen the Black Panther is forced to go to America in secret and deal with the situation personally. Little does he know that his actions will have extreme repercusions for the rest of the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent ""comic book"" movie that combined a dynamic plot, good acting and plentiful action throughout. I especially liked the acting of both Chadwick Boseman (as ""T'Challa"") and Michael B. Jordan (""Erik Killmonger"") who seemed tailor-made for their parts. On the flip side, however, I must also say that there were some minor flaws in the CGI and that I didn't especially care for the character of ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) who was unnecessarily annoying. But that aside, I enjoyed this film overall and I have rated it accordingly."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary ""Killmonger"" is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira (""The Walking Dead""), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown (""This is Us""), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2018,6/10,"RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, ""Black Panther"" details events when T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T'Challa's reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik ""Killmonger"" (Michael B. Jordan).With its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), ""Black Panther"" was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called ""racist"" by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie's likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn't all that involving. It's basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even ""Ant-Man"" (2015).Still, it's respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there's some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a ""colonizer,"" which isn't even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.The waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic's story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the ""Panther's Rage"" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. And it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T'Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It's a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn't acknowledged in this movie; shameful.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz√∫ Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).GRADE: B-"
BLACK PANTHER,8 April 2018,8/10,"I did not think I would enjoy this film as much as I did from the trailers I saw of the film, but it ended up surprising me. This movie gives us more insight into the world of the hero, the Black Panther, first introduced into the Marvel movie universe in the third Captain America movie. The film is rather lengthy as we traverse a lot of ground in this one as the film features two villains. While the film is good, it also really does nothing to lead up to the Infinity War film coming up later this month. Then again, very few Marvel films have really done much lead in to it other than the first Guardians of the Galaxy film and the introduction of a few infinity stones here and there. Mainly, in films like this, the only we get is an introduction to a new Marvel character on the big screen.The story has the Black Panther taking on the role of king in his country after a ceremony where he can be challenged by others in his country of Wakanda. His first course of action is to take on a man who has been smuggling vibranium and selling it to the rest of the world. Vibranium is the strongest metal in the world! Well, it is in the Marvel cinematic universe, but it is actually admantium in the comics. Vibranium is a metal in the comics that is unstable and has to be interwoven in other metals to be effective, otherwise it is just a dangerous and highly volatile liquid metal that can cause great amounts of damage if left unchecked. When combined with admantium it then becomes nearly indestructible as this is what the Cap's shield is actually made of, not just vibranium. Um, kind of went on a nerd rant there. Well, they track this villain to a place in Asia, but soon another villain appears, calling himself, Killmonger. He is also of Wakadian descent and soon makes a bid for the throne himself. Soon a power struggle takes a place with the winner being head of the country with the largest vibranium deposits in the world! I liked the character of the Black Panther and I enjoyed seeing inside his world which is very ritualistic and at the same time futuristic! There was more humor in the film than I was expected and I thought the Black Panther's sister was so cute and funny. The villains were both good in this one too, as we had one that had a super weapon within his hand and Killmonger seemed such a unstable villain as he looks so reserved and then goes insane at times. The film was better than I was expecting as the trailers did not do the film justice. The film had very good action and some nice humor to fill in the spots between the action. I enjoyed the scenery in this one and the look into the fictional country of Wakanda. If another Black Panther film comes out, I look forward to seeing it as well."
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,7/10,"What I find laughable on here are the reviewers that complain that there are alot of fake reviews and so the ratings are rigged. You could say that from a movie that got only a dozen reviews but not in this case with more than 2000 reviews. I've seen dozens of movies where the ratings were rigged but Black Panther is not one of them. That you don't like this movie is your right, but don't talk about fake reviews, because in this case you're the one with a fake review, giving the lowest score possible is just a joke. You're not going to tell me that this movie was one of the worst movies you ever saw, or I can only conclude you never watched alot of movies before. I'm not a big fan of Marvel movies, most of the time I'm a bit bored, but with Black Panther I didn't have that feeling. The story was interesting, maybe not perfect but at least it wasn't boring. The acting was okay even if it was not world class acting. The computer generated images were in most of the cases good, sometimes they could have been better, certainly with a high budget like that, but nonetheless it was all entertaining. And entertainment is exactly what I expect to get when watching this kind of movies. So for the negative people I would just say to get a life and rate it fairly, like a four or five stars but not a one star because that's just ridiculous."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,8/10,"As a fun Marvel Movie, this one is OK. We finally get to explore the hidden, yet very advanced African country of Wakanda, and as we wonder why they do nothing with the power and knowledge they have, the film explores that, too. It's too bad that basically Chadwick Boseman plays a CGI Jacob King and the plot is that of the Lion King. What would Disney say? Well, nothing, because this movie is made by Marvel in collaboration with Disney Studios. Yet we did have to introduce Black Panther before Infinity Wars, so that is why this movie was made.It's not all bad, though. The acting is good, the special effects - barring the fight at the end - are nice, the story makes some sort of sense. The basic outline of the plot, though, is that, in the spirit of unity between men, Wakanda should rise from under its cover and help black people everywhere. Or that, in the spirit of helping the oppressed, it should rise from under its cover and conquer the world. Yeah, neither of those sentences make a lot of sense.Bottom line: fun, better than average, but frankly I would have preferred a spin-off movie with Ulysses Klaue as the main character. Do that, Marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,7/10,"One of the Biggest Box-Office Blockbusters of All-Time, 'Black Panther' is PURE Popcorn Entertainment! This Panther is a true superhero, whose cultural triumph is even more important than its storytelling propose.'Black Panther' Synopsis: T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, rises to the throne in the isolated, technologically advanced African nation, but his claim is challenged by a vengeful outsider who was a childhood victim of T'Challa's father's mistake.Predictable to a fault, 'Black Panther' is a zesty blend of mesmeric action & predictable cliches. Having said that, there's no denying that this worthy critical & commercial smash never fails to engage its viewer.Ryan Coogler & Joe Robert Cole's Screenplay is up for the claps as it rightly establishes Stan Lee's raging Superhero. And make no mistake, the experience & joy of watching an Black Cast delivering explosive action & drama, is one of its own. The Writing is well-done, although the second-hour does give inn to many cliches, that do effect its impact overall. But, for the most part, the Writing is nicely sustained. Coogler's Direction is superb. The Director seems to be confident & assured in his first blockbuster directorial effort. Cinematography & Editing are done with merit. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics are top-notch. Action-Sequences are simply spell-binding. Ludwig G√∂ransson's score is rocking.Performance-Wise: Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, is charismatic all through. He has the heroic presence to hold his own. Michael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, is over-the-top. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, is charming. Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi, passes muster. Danai Gurira as Okoye, is first-rate. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, is a strong, persuasive menace. Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, is effective. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, is adequate. Forest Whitaker as Zuri, does not deliver. His role appears forced. On the whole, 'Black Panther' offers a strong impact & its cultural importance, is impossible to ignore. Lets Marvel This!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 February 2019,6/10,"Really don't watch much of ""Marvel"" stuff, more of a ""D.C."" guy still checked out the hyped and ever grossing ""Black Panther"" and the film entertained and was filled with some drama, still it wasn't one of my favorite hero films. After the death of the king young T' Challa(Chadwick Boseman) is faced with the test of putting his country and family first against the world. His own nation is high tech and as the new king fractions of family and war with sibling rival make this film somewhat of an interesting drama with a good turn from Michael B. Jordan. Overall an okay film with special effects and good action fight scenes that involve CGI also."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"This movies production is a merger of South Korea, Georgia (USA) and Australia. I have never read the comic books but this movie is very well done. The locations, the cast, and the production between Marvel, Disney, and Lucas Films is once again film magic.The Scenery is astounding, the special effect are right on, and most importantly the script is excellent giving the actors room to act and they do it so well. One of the Script Writers, is also the director(Ryan Coogler) of the film Creed. There are a couple members of the cast from that film too. The costumes are amazing, and the sound track is spot on. The theme of unity at the end is a good message. The film length at slightly over 2 hours is about right. As far as the entertainment, well Stan Lee is definitely holding on here for safe keeping. Andy Serkis from the Apes movie series is Ulysses Klaue, and though his role is cut short, he plays him to the hilt. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan head up a talented cast. The ladies including Lupita Nyong (Star Wars-The Force Awakens) do not by any stretch take a back seat to the male cast.There's so much action, it is very nearly the end of the film before there is any romance. By the time the films kisses come, well, the credits roll shortly after. There's lots of crudos to go around on this movie. Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) is Everett K Ross, a former pilot and CIA agent whose nowhere near being in charge in this film. Letitia Wright as Shuri stands out.As usual, wait and watch the credits for some surprises, and to applaud an excellent cast and crew put together to make this one."
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2018,7/10,"To view the with-it and all-the-rage BLACK PANTHER's record-breaking phenomenon through an outside-the-stateside perspective, there is a sadness in our desensitized force-feeding by those ballooning superhero tentpoles whose by-the-numbers narrative, churned out in a rigidly formulaic mode, gingerly cleaves to its comic strip origin, a populist black-or-white world-view and nothing is in the gray area, heck, relative to which, BLACK PANTHER is not an anomaly. In a fictive African nation Wakanda, which poses as a third-world country but is endowed with cutting-edge technology by virtue of its natural reserves of an omnipotent metal named ""vibranium"" (the metaphor is self-evident), T'Challa (Boseman) takes over the throne after the death of his father King T'Chaka (John and Atandwa Kani in different time frames), which occurred in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016), and soon finds himself facing the challenge from Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Jordan), the son of his uncle N'Jobu (Brown), who is spoiling for avenging his father's death in the hand of T'Chaka and indeed he successfully dethrones T'Challa in the duel. But, crippled by the time-worn slight of many a villain before him, he pulls his punch in the coup-de-gr√¢ce which doesn't immediately dispatch T'Challa (it pains this reviewer to watch that falling off a cliff never actually kills the protagonist) as audience placidly anticipates the latter to rise like a phoenix from the ashes to recoup his final victory by executing a fratricide just like his father.However by-the-book the story unfolds and segues, director Ryan Coogler vamps up the film with a scintillating visual-scape which foregrounds the spectacular world-building of Wakanda, drawing on the African land's exotic scenery and its tribes' indigenous looks and accoutrements, beautifully marries the tradition with the streamlined futurity, an action piece set in South Korea induces the right dosage of spills and thrills (a step up of virtual reality and driver-less car), and effectually whisks away Martin Freeman's agent Everett Ross to a place where he can viscerally experience the sticking-out-like-a-sore-thumb otherness, not without self-abasing humor to hit home its message.  Essentially what benefits BLACK PANTHER greatly is the fact that it is woke enough to centralize a cohort of black superheroes and especially cautious to not let its female characters eclipsed below the masculine shadows. Both Danai Gurira's ballsy virago Okoye and Letitia Wright's gizmo-savvy princess Shuri are inspirational characters and can-do warriors, which dwarfs Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia into awkwardly comporting herself within a more conventional love interest cubbyhole. With that in mind, then it appears there is a crying shame to leave a geared-up Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) out of the battle completely, an imposing Bassett shouldn't be all toned up just to fit the garment, maybe ageism is next-in-line as the genre's bullet-point obstacle, considering elderly folks in the comic books rarely live to a privileged death of natural cause (including a venerated Forest Whitaker here to extract empathy). Chadwick Boseman makes for a very fine hero, majestic in stance and feline in motion, Michael B. Jordan, on the other hand, has a more naturally hunky stature and finishes off the antagonistic job with spanking commitment. Only, this reviewer has to quibble about their final smackdown, and floats a comparison with the climatic fistfight adjacent to a zippily streaking train in Wong Kar-Wai's THE GRANDMASTER (2013), for all its kinetic momentum, is the former a homage to the latter, or a less enlivening show piece that doesn't necessarily live up to all the awesomeness preceding it? Either case, ""don't believe the hype"" is always the ultimate maxim any film lover should religiously abide by."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"'BLACK PANTHER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role (who first appeared in 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and the movie costars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker. It was directed by Ryan Coogler, who also helmed the critically acclaimed hits 'FRUITVALE STATION' and 'CREED' (which also both starred Jordan), and it was written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (based on characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby). The story revolves around the African superhero returning home to the nation of Wakanda, where he is now king, but his leadership is challenged by a new enemy. The film has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's being called (by some) a revolutionary cultural movement (in much the same way that 'WONDER WOMAN' was last year). It's also projected to break records at the Box Office, and become Marvel Cinema's biggest hit to date. I really enjoyed it as well. The story begins right after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', with T'Challa (Boseman) returning home to the African nation of Wakanda. Since his father was killed, T'Challa is named the new king of Wakanda. At the same time a Wakandan exile, going by the name of Killmonger (Jordan), has aligned himself with a South African black-market arms dealer, named Ulysses Klaue (Serkis), and is plotting to overthrow T'Challa. T'Challa, as the superhero Black Panther, attempts to stop Klaue from stealing more vibranium (while unaware of Killmonger's involvement). Two female special forces agents (Nyong'o and Gurira), CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Freeman), and T'Challa's teenage sister Shuri (Wright), all end up aiding him on this mission.I have to agree that this is one of Marvel Cinema's best movies, and I think it's cultural significance (and popularity) is really inspiring too. While I don't think it's quite as good a film as 'WONDER WOMAN' is, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right. It's great that superhero movies (in general) are becoming such a respected, and revolutionary art form too. Haters will of course still hate the film (as they did 'WONDER WOMAN' as well, and anything that creates such powerful progress like this), but everyone else should definitely enjoy it (unless you just really hate superhero movies). The action scenes are spectacular, the performances are all good, the humor is clever and witty, and the dramatic scenes are moving (and briefly touching too). Coogler once again proves what a talented director he is, and he appears to be the perfect filmmaker for this important movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"Serviceable. As many positives this movie featured, the one word that popped up in my head constantly was: Serviceable.Don't get me wrong: the movie's good and there's not much to point to that's bad, but stripping away the great cast, incredible world-building universe and special effects, it's the most average origin story.The star and best part of the movie, Chadwick Boseman a.k.a. The Title Character, was fantastic and stole every scene. Granted, I would've liked to see him more in his full-body superhero outfit (you'll see as much of him as the Panther as you did Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. In other words, not much.) But, thankfully, he does carry the feature with his great chemistry with the cast and charisma on screen.As mentioned, the world these characters live in and their mythos was also great to see and unbelievably believable. I knew little to nothing about this comic book's background and for them to set it up so nicely that it became realty, was very welcomed.Also really nice was that this was a self-contained story in a huge universe. Never opposed to other Marvel characters showing up, even just to say: ""Greetings!"" but it's nice this stood alone. Of course, aside from the setup, that is.Boseman's T'Challa is still mourning the loss of his father in Captain America's Civil War movie...but, then again, it's only been a week since those events. Nevertheless, he needs to be the new King of his (certainly not a ****hole) nation of Wakanda, he needs to prove himself to his people, himself and his father's spirit and bring in a criminal who's taking a break from Middle Earth, Kong Island and this very MCU. There's much more to the story, but why ruin it?The movie takes itself very seriously and that's an ENORMOUS relief from Marvel's go-to formula: 80% comedies with 20% superheroing, i.e. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man Three, both Guardian of the Galaxies and Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies relied almost exclusively on humor and so little on what I bought a ticket for. Mercifully, they kept the humor - which was sometimes funny - to a minimum here.This isn't a movie I'd rush to see again, mostly because the main plot is so average and predictable, but it's definitely recommended to see once, especially for all the positives mentioned above. ***Final thoughts: As a favor and quasi-birthday gift to my friend, I agreed to stay and see the two post-credit scenes that I usually hate to waste my time waiting for. No spoiler to the content, but a warning: these were two of the lamest I've seen. The first is something we already knew was coming and the second is something we already knew about. There were no surprises and, AS ALWAYS, they were completely avoidable. They're always available online to see so you don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the theatre to see 3 seconds of blah."
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2019,8/10,"Black Panther is a superhero movie that, for the most part, isn't about superhero stuff like saving the world. In a way it's a movie that makes the case for a superhero ethic.Black Panther is a king of Wakanda, an advanced technological nation that tells the world it's a third-world African country in order to stay under the radar. Because of the charade, Wakanda does little for earth, hoarding its technology and resources and leaving the rest of the world to manage without it. Much of the film isn't about being a hero; it's about the hunt for a criminal.For a good chunk of the time, the movie focuses more on interpersonal drama and world-building than action. This world-building is impressive; Wakanda seems like a very real place, offering an African nation that combines, like other high tech countries like Japan, ancient traditions with modernity. It's a country that shows little influence from the west.This is also a movie that, like Mad Max: Fury Road, has a ton of strong women. Outside of the star, the heroes are women, and with a minor exception, all the bad guys are men (including a terrific Andy Serkis).Outside of a wonderful chase scene, all the really great action comes in the end, with a massive, lengthy battle on multiple fronts that is electrifying throughout."
BLACK PANTHER,26 July 2019,4/10,"Very aesthetically pleasing with a GREAT cast. but overall i felt a little underwhelmed, especially with the action. and some of the parts that seem like they are fully CGI feel unreal. black panther was more bad-ass in civil war than in this movie, and that's not a good thing when he was one of like 12 superheroes in that movie with very little screen time, while starring in this one.on second viewing most of my feelings are confirmed. this is a very weak movie. weak action, little semblance of story, poor dialogue, cliche moments. worst of all, it really tested my patience with the lack of excitement. i think this is the only time i've ever said that about an MCU movie. even the stan lee cameo was probably the worst in any marvel movie. the token white guy's storyline was pointless. forrest whittaker was BAD.i tried one more time, gave it a third chance. i starts off well, but it spends so much time in the set up phase, only to make me wonder what the setup had anything to do with the plot. it was overly preachy, which i don't like in my movies. i more than fine with messages, but not this blatant. i fully sympathize with the message, but i don't like it in my entertainment. i was straight-up laughing at forrest whittaker's accent.i know i keep going back to this, but i can't emphasize it enough. every moment that t'challa or black panther were on the screen in civil war was pure gold. i immediately fell in love with black panther. i didn't know he was in the movie, didn't know t'challa was a superhero, liked the actor right away. and it was all so perfect. all his fight scenes were amazing. his beastliness immediately rivaled the rest of the MCU crew. the post credit scene got me SO excited for this movie. it should have been really easy to please me. the fact that they didn't saddens me (3 viewings, 5/8/2020)
SPOILERS
for someone named killmonger, he really likes throwing ppl rather than dealing a fatal blow. the fake death of t'challa was so lame. why is there air craft battles in this? you know i love me some jet fights but it really wasn't necessary in this movie and didn't feel like it belonged. felt like hey it's an mcu movie we need flight battles.i really didn't understand the story line, i would love for someone to explain it to me. killmonger shows up in wakanda like 45 minutes into the movie. i was trying to understand why the stuff before it lead us here. he stole the vibranium ax for klau, klau tried to sell it to the cia, got caught, killmonger broke him out, killed him, and then went to wakanda. what? the only thing i could think of is that he needed klau to gain an audience, but then why didn't he kill him from the start? why steal the ax? stuff just kind of happened cause the story said so, didn't have a natural flow.and so many moments were so obvious, like his sister saying ""there is no way he can beat t'challa"" = t'challa is gonna lose. mbaka saying we will not help = we will come in at the last second to have a dramatic entrance. the entire last action sequence did very little for me. not a fan of his new explosive ability, i really loved that he's basically a ninja, no need for all that extra stuff. does cap need a bunch of fancy colorful weapons? no. neither does black panther. similar to how i felt about spider-man's suit"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"'Black Panther (2018)' portrays a perspective so often missing from mainstream media and is refreshing because of it, a vibrant and celebratory vision of an oft overlooked culture infused with the sci-fi futurism inherent to the genre. It actually feels rather unique, despite some of its more 'superhero' genre elements, and is typically a smaller, more character-focused affair than its counterparts. The special-effects can be slightly overbearing at times, though; there are some digital body doubles that both look dodgy and do some dodgy things. Still, thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay, this doesn't really take away from the believability of proceedings because we're always invested in our hero, who's as incredibly tangible and entertainingly combat-capable here as he was in his debut appearance. The feature is thematically rich and, occasionally, emotionally moving, too. It's accomplished, enjoyable stuff that represents some of Marvel's (and the genre's) best work to date. 8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,7/10,The film is really good of course expected more but it's worth to watch.
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,5/10,"The usual introduction and disclaimer applies. When I chose to go to a comics-inspired movie I expect a different type of experience than the one that I expect when I go do a Shakespeare-inspired film or an European art production. Yet, there are good films and bad films and I have seen all of them in all genres. Within the limits of its genre I did not find 'Black Panther' directed by Ryan Coogler to be a very good film and it's difficult to me to understand the enthusiastic reception given to it by some of the film critics that I otherwise agree with most of the time. It's not a bad film either. It's just average.The idea could actually work as most of the ideas of comics-based characters. A meteorite hit Earth million of years ago bringing with it a precious metal, vibranium, stronger than anything we know plus some curative properties. Vibranium is something like the reverse of kryptonite which was annihilating the powers of Superman, with the difference that while the Black Panther superhero can use it and become superhero by drinking it in liquor form, his whole nation of Wakanda can enjoy its power and build an advanced underground civilization in a secluded area of Africa, with one of the poorest countries on Earth as a cover above the ground. If you did not hear about Wakanda you should not worry, you probably did not hear about many of the - say - 20 poorest nations on Earth members of the UN. The adventures of young king T'Challa who ascended to the throne and is confronted with many internal and external threats and enemies as well as with the dilemma whether to continue the isolationist policies of his father and ancestors ('Wakanda first' :-) ) or open and share his technology with the rest of the planet and especially with the oppressed categories on it are the essence of the story. The rest is CGI and 3D effects.It is visible that film director Ryan Coogler made a serious effort to add a layer of serious items to the basic comics story. Allusions to current events in the US and rest of the world like racial inequities, war as a mean of settling conflicts and isolationism are more than transparent. The treatment they get in the film is pretty conventional and there are no surprises or dilemmas, there are more questions than answers. Characters are quite well differentiated but their depth does not exceed the two dimensions of the comics heroes - we pretty much know from start what they will be doing and how they will react to various challenges. Good acting by a few well known and other lesser known actors could not add too much, not even the fantastic Forest Whitaker or Angela Bassett. Computer graphics are spectacular but they lack innovation, I found them to be at the middle of the road between 'Star Wars' and 'The Jungle Book' (the animated version). One atop the other, it's reasonable entertainment for kids of all ages (and I include myself in this category) but it's not up to the buzz."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,8/10,"'Black Panther' has received a lot of hype surround it being the first superhero film with a black leading man (even though that mantel probably should have gone to 1997's 'Spawn,' but it is correct at least in terms of the current Marvel Shared Universe). However, I really don't believe its success will have much to do with anything so shallow. In short: it's a modern day Marvel film and, if you're a regular at the multiplexes, you'll probably already know what to expect: a hero with superpowers taking on - basically - an evil version of themselves. So, if that's what you're into (and current Box Office trends says that many of us are!) then you're going to enjoy this just as much as 'Iron Man, Thor' and all the others. The reason: it's just a cool, colourful, charismatic film which is great to eat popcorn to.It's set just after 'Captain America: Civil War,' but perhaps one of the first things I should mention is that you don't really need to have seen any other films in the MCU to fully understand everything that happens here. We meet up with King T'Challa of (fictional African nation) Wakanda who, along with ruling his nation since the recent death of his father, also moonlights as the super-powered 'Black Panther,' who, as yet, has kept his and his country's 'special' abilities a secret from the rest of the world. Now, faced with exposure of just what Wakanda is capable of, he is faced with whether to continue its current way of existing, or enter the fray (which will no doubt take him further into the path of the Avengers and their exploits).So, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but it's definitely a distant cousin of the recent Marvel movie 'Thor: Ragnarok' in terms of its look and feel. It's very colouring to look at (nothing DC-like by being all 'dark and gritty' here!) - you may even say its looks like a 'living comic book!). It's a great-looking film visually, but, if you're being overly-critical, you could say that there's a little too much CGI, especially in the backdrops. I know this is a criticism levelled at all 'fantastical' films where whole new planets/civilisations have to be created, but sometimes you can tell the King is talking to someone up against a greenscreen.Also, it's worth noting that there isn't - quite - as much humour in this film as other recent Marvel entries. I guess this is down to - sort of - handicapping its leading man by making him a King. Before, we've had leading men who are gods/thieves/playboy billionaires - all of whom are allowed the freedom to let a witty quip roll of their tongues at a moment's notice. However, here, if the Black Panther did that, it would probably feel a little out of character. Luckily, the film makes up for this by surrounding him with a stellar supporting cast who are well-schooled in letting off steam with a one-liner or two.Overall, 'Black Panther' is just another excellent and enjoyable thrill ride in the Marvel universe. Don't expect anything too deep or revolutionary - just expect a good time and be prepared to bow at not just His Majesty - the King of Wakanda - but also yet another amazingly-successful in a film franchise that never seems to be able to run out of steam."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"In the same but different way, Black Panther is bringing on the same amount of significance that Wonder Woman did last year. Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film. There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide. Wishful thinking sure, but it seems like there's been a shift since Wonder Woman, so why not after Black Panther?9.0/10"
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,,"It really does feel like we've been waiting for a very long time for a superhero film like this, one that can be exciting beyond the usual fans of the genre. The action here is spellbinding, but more than that, the characters are very well developed. Boseman shines, and so does Michael B Jordan, who challenges us to root against him despite his charisma and character background. This is definitely one that is very much worth it."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,8/10,"I decided to see ""Black Panther"" once again with the recent death of Chadwick Boseman, who starred in the eponymous lead. The first comic-book superhero movie ever nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it stands out from the field of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a few important respects, but before getting into that, seeing this now gives new meaning to the part of the picture involving the ""ancestral plane,"" where sons become kings through the revisiting of their dead fathers. Although not always the case, as the loss of most silent films to inappreciation and inflammable nitrate have attested, film has long been considered as a sort of afterlife. Like family photographs, they're memories captured indefinitely. Chaplin, Garbo, Bogart, Monroe, Brando--many cinematic icons have long since passed, but they continue to flicker on this ancestral plane of motion-picture screens. This long pantheon now includes Boseman. His legacy will endure. We see this in his hero's journey as T'Challa, a.k.a Black Panther, too, of life, death and rebirth. In a sense, Wakanda really is forever.Boseman is magnetic, as well. It's the role, the one he originated in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and reprised in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), for which he'll be most remembered. There is some fine acting and characterizations all around in ""Black Panther"" even compared to other star-studded superhero ensembles nowadays. Largely, this is due to the picture going beyond the generic jocular or, contrastingly, darkly pompous tone of so many others in the genre. For every ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), say, or, in the other regard, ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), where it works, there are a bunch more imitations where it doesn't. Long-established stars, such as Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker, are leveraged in the usual way (a trend dating back at least to the casting of Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, among others, to lend the appearance of legitimacy to ""Superman"" (1978) and a strategy continued throughout the MCU and DCEU). Minor parts are well occupied, too, by the likes of Winston Duke, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright. As others have noted, however, it's Michael B. Jordan's antagonist who's the standout here. Given the unprecedented awards attention the superhero movie received, it's a surprising snub that Jordan wasn't recognized with a Best Supporting Actor nomination.There's some entertaining genre shifting throughout; between the usual MCU joking (the quips of Wright's little sister/scientific genius are a highlight) and superheroic car chasing and CGI-enhanced fight sequences, we also get a James Bond-type spy thriller, which leads to some of the most dazzling long-take tracking compositions inside the casino brawl, and a sociopolitical polemic played out on a Shakespearean scale of monarchical intrigue. For a scenario that's a fantasy in various respects--besides the myth of the singular scientific genius (√† la a Tony Stark or Bruce Banner) and an economically and technologically advanced nation isolated from trade and mixing cityscapes and automated mining with agrarian attachment to the land and warrior-code ancient rituals--Wakanda is primarily a wish-fulfillment of African hegemony, of black power. It's a fortunate accident of history that the comic book, the first mainstream one, I'm told, of a superhero of African descent, was named ""Black Panther,"" like but unrelated to the political organization of the Black Panther Party that was established around the same time. Because, for all its fantasy, unlike the rest of the MCU and much of comic-book fare, ""Black Panther"" is inextricably tied to the real world and the history of race, of colonialism and slavery and even the origins of humanity from Africa. And it is this that is the basis of the struggle between Boseman's T'Challa and Jordan's Killmonger.Otherwise, the MCU mostly abandoned realism after its decade-plus abstraction with extraterrestrials of a 9/11 allegorical attack on New York in ""The Avengers"" (2012) and, before that, some skirting with the War on Terror in ""Iron Man"" (2008)--none of which amounted to a semblance of profundity on such matters anyways. But, here, there really are competing ideologies rooted in reality, between isolated protectionism and of opening up to an exchange of resources and of armed revolution. One need not be overly diligent in keeping up with current events to see that these issues are ever present and that the same divisions remain between working within the system and from without and violently against. And so, with Killmonger, there is the lived African-American experience, as weaponized by the government-overthrowing CIA, coming into conflict with the ancestral past of T'Challa retreating into a paradise away from a world of colonization and slave trading and continued racial discrimination.Plus, the spectator still gets the spectacle of the usual CGI, as well as some of the best and more original costume design, musical scoring and overall production design of the entire Marvel franchise. And the result is an entry of unique cultural significance, of a mainstream blockbuster representing and celebrating black heritage and visible outside the frame even in the common adoption of the Wakanda salute and the slogan of ""Wakanda Forever."" All of this, and Boseman, are part of our shared cinematic universe now, our culture and the ancestral plane."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"I admit to not knowing much about the Black Panther, but I have read some comics with him in it. The only things I knew was that his real name was T'Challa and he came from the fictional country of Wakanda, a technologically advanced place with a policy of isolation. That's really all you have to know to enjoy this movie! This movie really downplays the superhero aspect. It's a lot more about this country deciding whether or not it should release its technology to the rest of the world.The end credits assure us that the Black Panther will be in the next Avengers movie. This movie is simply beautiful to look at. Every time we get a good look at Wakanda's world, it's a visual delight. It really downplays the aspect of it being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . I really thought that was something new and different for these creators. We get great action scenes and enough interesting things to keep any newcomer intrigued. ***1/2"
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,,"Rich in African culture, packed with relevant themes, dense with fully realised characters, powered by a terrific ensemble, and steered by a talented filmmaker who's only getting better with every subsequent film, Black Panther is enjoyable, entertaining & engaging for the most part, and is a celebration of a heritage that rarely gets a just portrayal on the silver screen. Sure to leave most of its viewers satisfied, it's another solid entry in Marvel's canon that definitely ranks amongst the better examples of their cinematic universe."
BLACK PANTHER,28 December 2018,8/10,"I was worried that people were only saying Black Panther was good because they were afraid to say it was bad, but it's actually a well-made & entertaining film. It has a compelling story, unique settings, cool visuals and interesting characters-Michael B. Jordan, in particular, makes a great villain. It's not the best Marvel movie ever, but it's definitely in the top tier."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. The spectacle of this film is absolutely breathtaking, the whole world of Wakanda is established well by director Ryan Coogler. We are utterly convinced that this a real society, with a clear sense of community conveyed, as well as concise character's. I will admit that I was a little let down as a result of all the hype surrounding it, it did not manage to live up to my expectations. While it does nail the action and intensity, the humour, something that Marvel usually masters, was very mediocre for me. There is several cringey moments that were trying too hard to be funny when these characters simply are not humourus, I would have been fine with the film taking itself completely seriously. The cast are all around terrific, the standouts being Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, who nails it and lives up to his terrific set up in Civil War, and Michael B. Jordan, who play's one of Marvel's greatest villains yet as Killmonger. The sibling rivalry-type relationship between these two characters created a relationship that was thrilling to watch. Other cast members, such as Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis, among many others, all shine in their parts, all having individually brilliant moments. The film also deserves credit as being the first big budget blockbuster to feature a largely African-American cast, it is a huge steppingstone for film and I hope others follow what Marvel has set. Action packed and original. Intense, well acted and featuring a slew of great characters, I would recommend Black Panther to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.
A forner victim of Black Panther's father puts his nation under threat. 
Best Performance: Michael B. Jordan"
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2021,7/10,"I think it's an overrated movie.But I understand why, I understand very well.Still, it was fun to watch."
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,3/10,"Let's start w/the positives. In the car chase scene (of course there had to be one) were a couple of sequences that were kind of cool. Also good to see a bit of African culture w/neck rings, lip plates & scarification. 
On the down side I was hoping to see great scenes from Africa, but instead got Georgia, USA; Korea; Argentina. 
Dialogue was typical teen level oversimplification so as not to scare the audience away or invoke brain freeze. 
Acting, unfortunately, was too rote memorization school technique. 
Action, fight sequences - same old, same old unimaginative kicks/swings w/wire tosses through the air. Car chases. Yes, boring. 
For tech we have a futuristic aircraft that made the so overused & unreal swooshing sound accompanied by the usual looks cool design, but aerodynamically would fail a middle school science class. Don't get me started on super metal, as every element we know of in the Universe has already been seen and would have already been on dear old Earth. Invisible domed city? Hasn't that already been used in several movies. Then there's the typical basement/behind a nondescript door research lab for super weapons. 
Costumes! The trend in Hollywood has always been for some fashion person holed up for life in their cubby hole making showy non-functional synthetic costumes for sy-fy/fantasy movie look always the same. 
Plot - evil family members (or corporate or government) to take over the world. Magic curing potions; hallucinatory dream sequences. Ugghhhh!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,8/10,"Black PantherThe worst part of being a black superhero is when you turn supervillains over to authorities you get arrested.Thankfully, the African-American protector in this action movie runs his own country.Sworn to defend the clandestine nation of Wakanda, the mantle of Black Panther has been passed down through the ages where it - as well as the title of king - has now been bestowed on T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).But not everyone supports that royal appointment, namely the outsider Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and his arms dealing ally (Andy Serkis) who is after Wakandan resources.With a culturally rich narrative that transcends race and sex, Marvel's most complex Avenger takes center stage. Backed by a stellar supporting cast as multifaceted as him, Black Panther's first solo outing is not only a milestone for the genre but the industry. Now, let's work towards a day when T'Challa can simply be called: Panther. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2018,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Black Panther"" (2018) is a superbly entertaining and superbly crafted movie. It has superb look - cinematography was gorgeous. The great Ryan Coogler did an amazing job with this movie - its superbly paced - at running time 2 h 15 min i was entertained from the beginning till end. Overall, ""Black Panther"" is a superbly crafted movie which is simply fun to watch. Great movie all around."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,7/10,"Marvel adheres to a tested recipe - ""If you've found a winning combination, stick to it."" They string high-budget action blockbusters one after another, maintaining the level with small variations. There are no masterpieces, but there are no failures either. Although I understand why they do it, personally, I don't like that approach, because all their movies follow same pattern and resemble each other. Without risk, there's no danger of failure, but there's no opportunity to make a really good movie either.""Black Panther"" is visually stunning, fast-paced and entertaining. The combination of tribal features and futuristic costumes and technology is in perfect balance and the landscapes of Wakanda are beautiful, while the action scenes are directed to leave you breathless. The acting is good, but the characters and the story itself could be much better developed. Rather than to provide a good script, and then take advantage of big budgets and modern technology to make this story as impressive as possible, I think that Marvel films are based solely on the visual spectacle, leaving the story in the background.I watched the movie in the theater and I'm not sorry, I enjoyed it and had a good time. But I believe that in a couple of days I will not remember what the film was about, which is happening to me with almost every Marvel film.7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2019,8/10,"This predominately African American superhero blockbuster attempts to break into the cultural diversity genre and offer up a more emotive, thoughtful collision between good and evil. In many ways it succeeds, yet it remains to be seen whether the depiction of African Americans are truly authentic and innately faithful to respecting cultural differences. There are suggestions that, like its stereotypical predecessors popularized for the Western audience, liberties may have been taken. There are several weaknesses in two of the early fight scenes that seem to be more for the screenwriter's convenience to move the storyline along rather to offer a more convincing display of intelligent preparations for combat. The male dominated action scenarios continue with some effort to provide some balance to the violence inherent in action-thrillers. What makes this superhero movie stand out a bit from the rest is its attempt at a humanistic theme that emerges in places but doesn't quite fulfill the potential of a truly classic movie of real depth. In some ways, this movie reflects the current political turmoil in America today as good and evil are on display in the morality of what a Country stands for. Black Panther results in a good effort that sustains interest and incorporates the requisite elements for a superhero movie and includes a bit more thoughtfulness."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,7/10,"Follows the events of 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. T'Challa Udaku (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as king, only to find, that an old enemy, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens AKA N'Jadaka (Michael B. Jordan) has reappears to challenge him for the throne. Without spoiling too much of the film, from all 'Cinematic Universe' movies from the Walt Disney Company & Marvel Studios so far, there is perhaps, none that is more celebrated from fanboys & movie critics, right now, than director, Ryan Coolger's superhero film, ""Black Panther"". The film received praise for nearly everything. It even become one of the highest-grossing films of all time. A global phenomenon. However, it does beg the question, is all that praise, truly justified? The answer is somewhat yes. 'Black Panther' was indeed an entertaining movie. However, it's not a complete perfect masterpiece of art. Some of the praise from critics and fans is a bit overblown to the point, that it sounds like pompous. They're overlooking some of the film's biggest flaws. Examples include the fishing plot-hole, pacing issues, the story being too similar to 1994's animation movie, 'the Lion King', the heavy use of fake-looking CGI during the clich√© looking chase sequences, the uneven & unrealistic portrayal of modern day economics in isolated sovereign state, and last, by not least, the lack of vulnerability & suspense when it comes to Black Panther's overpowered suit and abilities. All of these are worth criticize about. After all, all these issues came across, as very jarring on screen. It kinda took some audience members, out of the film. Although, it wasn't as distracting, as the obvious disconnected this movie had, over previous Marvel's films when it comes to the portrayal of Wakanda's intentional isolationism beliefs. Instead of having the nation be a little more open into intermingling with other countries; as seen in 'Captain America: Civil War'; where Wakanda had establish foreign aid with certain African nations like Lagos. The movie chose to backtrack, and make this African nation's people seem more traditional close-off; despite the fact, in the previous film, they were a powerful influencer in United Nation, when it comes to reviewing the Sokovia Accord. That was a big risky big retcon that sadly, didn't pay off. After all, Coogler and his writers kept the very public death scene for king, T'Chaka (John Kani) from the previous movie, even though, he supposed to be, a hermit. It doesn't add up. It lesser Killmonger's argument, big time. All this 'blind eye to foreign affairs' retcon muddled things up. It doesn't make much sense. Not only that; but it also made the world building seems a little more jarring. After all, how does the technologically advanced nation, stay so hidden for so long, during the Modern Digital Age? Do their citizens live within the country's border under a heavy watch by their government, unable to leave or bring anybody in? Seeing that Wakanda has assassins and spies, everywhere. I'm starting to doubt, that this nation is truly worth rooting for. After all, these are the same smart people that blindly follow their new leader into battle, without questioning anything about their way of leadership. The place sounds like a cult in the verge of turning into another Imperial Japan. After all, they worship a living embodiment of their panther god. Wakanda might be a highly control, centralized, cult of personality feudalism-like state. After all, there seem to be, some type of social caste system in Wakanda that borderline, doesn't seem right. If anything, side-villain, M'Baku (Winston Duke) seem more of the good guy than anybody in the film. He's the only one, truly using his brain, by questioning establishment and exploring his surroundings. Still, you would think, he would had expose the royal family's lies on the internet by now. After all, this tribe seem to know, a lot about some western culture. So, they has to be some sort access to the outside world to get that type of an information; even if it's hard to find a WIFI connect in the mountain. Regardless of that, another problem with the over-fawning by fans & critics, is how incorrect, some of them are with their praising. A good example is how some people treat this, as the first black superhero movie. They act like it's a milestone in cinema; which it is not. If you notice on IMDB, they has been black superheroes movies, way before this, like 1993's 'Meteor Man', 1997's 'Spawn' & 2008's 'Hancock' to name a few. It's nothing new. If anything 1998's 'Blade' deserve most of the credit. That's the true,' first Marvel black superhero movie ever'. Despite all that, there's are some truly some good examples to appreciate in 'Black Panther'; such as the Afro Punk design, the soundtrack, and the use of real foreign languages like Xhosa. Nevertheless, it's the unique characters that truly stand out. Even if, Chadwick Boseman's African accent sound cheesy. All the acting from the performers were great. Overall: While, 'Black Panther' might not be Wakanda Forever for me, due to plot-holes in the story. At least, it's not kitty litter. It's still a decent movie, worth checking out. Highly recommended."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,3/10,"I'm a Marvel fan and I think the movies have all ranged from above average to excellent with one exception, Dr Strange (2016) I simply didn't ""Get it"".Now with Black Panther the hype train was overwhelming, you couldn't turn any direction without having it shoved down your throat. From it being an amazing film to it being the first black led superhero movie, it was everywhere and therefore I expected something pretty special.For a start, it's not. In fact I'm not sure what I dislike more, this or Dr Strange. It's genuinely close. This is a mindless cgi-fest with a lackluster story and hardly feels like a Marvel movie at all.Secondly, can people pull their butts out of their heads for five minutes and get off this revolutionary ground breaking movie because of the leads ethnicity?Blade (1998) is Marvel, African American lead and 3 movies (Plus a tv show)Spawn (1997) (My favorite superhero) feature movie, African American leadCat Woman (2004) (Not even including the original Batman series) Halle Berry African American leadSteel (1997), African American leadAnd if we can touch upon comedy superhero movies we also have Blankman (1994) and Meteor Man (1993)Do I need to continue? Because I can, this isn't groundbreaking the whole thing was a publicity stunt and people ate it up with a spoon while the creators laughed all the way to the bank.Black Panther is a poor addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, it simply isn't very good but people are looking past that for all the wrong reasons. Take the blinkers off people.The Good:Andy SerkisThe suits do look greatThe Bad:Simply not engagingFeels very disconnected from the Marvel universeThings I Learnt From This Movie:This movie isn't propaganda it's an agenda, one that feels forced is dishonest and simply doesn't need to be"
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2019,6/10,"Other than the cultural significance, the excellent cast, and a truly resplendent production setup, Marvel's Black Panther is just one of the averagely scripted and poorly action-directed superhero films in the MCU, the type of lowbrow story that existed before its genre-bending Phase 3. TN."
BLACK PANTHER,24 November 2018,5/10,"First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"Once again I probably shouldn't get too excited over movies that I see trailers for because I an inevitably disappointed. Then again, I've probably reached the age where seeing a movie is just another of the endless number of processes that I go through, and since I have seen so many of them many of them cease to be all that interesting anymore. As they say in South-East Asia, when it comes to movies they are pretty much all same same (but different).
 I guess that is what the case was with regards to Black Panther - it was pretty much same same. In fact, in a way, it reminded my somewhat of The Phantom, though that probably has more to do with there always being a person around to take the mantle of the Black Panther, though in this case it is the king of Wakunda. The story goes that a meteorite hit Africa and five warring tribes discovered the power of the minerals in the meteorite and decided to come together as a kingdom. However, they also chose to shut themselves off from the world, and for most of history have been hidden from the eyes of everybody else. In their mind Wakunda is basically just another basketcase African country.
 Okay, there is a little twist in the plot, but in the end it is one of those good guy vs bad guy movies. Basically a prince of Wakunda betrays the country and is killed. His son then decides to seek out revenge, comes back to the country, challenges the king and wins. The king (who is also the Black Panther) then recovers from his wounds and returns to take back his throne, and I suspect you can work out where it goes from there. However, there is one theme that runs through the film, and that is how they should use their technology - should they help the world, or should they continue to sit back and watch.
 This isn't really much of an issue in the globalised world in which we now live, but I guess there is always that question of how one should interact with the world. The thing is that since Wakunda is an African nation, there is a lot of debate within the nation as to how they should react, considering that Africans tend to be, in the most cases, at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. Yet, it also seems to be a debate between arming them or hiding, yet there is also the possibility of there being a third way - using one's technology to educate them.
 Of course the problem with education is that one needs to want to be educated, because if one doesn't want to be educated then there is going to be a bit of an issue. Still, that isn't really what the film is about, but rather how they should interact with the world. Of course, when one is hiding away in their own little bubble, one fails to see the reality of what is beyond one's borders. This is why many of those who leave Wakunda as spies end up being challenged by what they see, and becoming angry at the failure of the Wakundans to actually do anything about it.
 Anyway, the film wasn't bad, though it did drag on a bit. Interestingly it seems to be set apart from many of the other Marvel films in that the focus is entirely upon the Black Panther - none of the other regulars make an appearance (except for Stan Lee, but he makes a cameo in pretty much all of the films). In a way they may had done it that way so as not to tie to too much into the timeline at this stage (particularly since the Black Panther does change with the king)."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,9/10,This is a great movie. It has a great acting. It also has a great story line. It is very fast past. If you like good stories you will like this movie.It is a great movie. It is one of best movies ever.
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"Going into this, I'll say I've become pretty tired of the established Marvel movie formula, and I'm pretty superheroed out, to be honest. Pros
1: the entire fate of the world / galaxy / universe is at stake. Not some alien creature yet again destroying some planet / world / universe yet again, until our costumed heroes stop them yet again.
2: Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger. Not just your usual 'Enemy of the Week Who Will Be Dead by the End of the Movie'. His ""you killed my father, prepare to die"" Inigo Montoya routine seemed very same old, same old that the reveal of his motivations initially left me fairly dubious. But Michael B. Jordan is so charismatic he sells it.
3: Letitia Wright's absolutely delightful, scene-stealing performance as Shuri in the film, I hope she is used in other movies. Shuri could schoolTony Stark on technology, and I hope Marvel put this in a movie. Wright's portrayal was a bright spot that lifted the dour moments without becoming just lame comic relief.
4: The supporting cast is solid (Not always the case with Marvel) General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira (Michone from Walking Dead). Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, or Lupita Nyong'o, all of whom are excellent in their respective roles as well.
5: Daniel Kaluuya performanceCons
1: The combat scenes are a real problem. The casino battle was too dark and difficult to follow what was going on. The final showdown didn't work as well for me. CGI Hero fights someone with identical powers in a different-coloured CGI suit. How many times have we seen that in Marvel movies?? 
2: The CGI was quite poor at times
3: A bit predictable at times. I appreciated the foreshadowing with the introduction of the second suit, though. As soon as it turned up in Shuri's lab, it was obvious what it would be used for
4: Daniel Kaluuya (he is on both lists) The screenplay really doesn't do him any favours at all!! His character arc is basically ""We're best friends!! Wait. You lost one fight with a guy I hate, so I'm supporting your rival. Then, I've changed my mind, let's be friends again now that my side is losing!"" W'Kabi isn't portrayed as a weaselly character that bends whichever way the wind is blowing!! He's just an underwritten character who just goes back and forth as the plot demands.
5: It lacked an emotional connection for me. When Forest Whitaker died it is played out as a moment that should have left us devastated, but I just wasn't bothered. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's not up there with my top Marvel movies, let alone my favourite superhero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,28 December 2019,7/10,"I just watched Black PantherI enjoyed it at the cinema, but truthfully it has not held up for me on repeat viewings. Whilst I appreciate the cultural significance of the movie, a Best Picture Oscar nomination it did not deserve. It wasn't even the best Marvel movie of the year (That honour goes to Logan).Chadwick Boseman is slightly over shadowed by a ridiculously charismatic turn by Michael B Jordan. Forest Whittaker and Angela Bassett are both good, as are Danai Girira and Lupia Nyong'o It is Letitia Wright who steals the show as Shuri however, she is a delight.The action scenes are all well done, but the final fight left me a bit bored as two faceless CGI characters slugged it outOverall I liked it, I just do not get why it was so over praised."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,,"""Black Panther"" and ""Wonder Woman"", two of the most successful genre movies based on Marvel and DC comics respectively, have something in common, something that may well be the key ingredient to their success. They are both founded on a rich mythological background which is solid enough for the audience to related to (i.e. not as farfetched as ""Thor""). By this time, the story of ""Black Panther"" must be so generally known that even a brief outline is superfluous. Still, I'll attempt one, just bare backbone of the story, with no reference to narrative style (which includes a few simple flashbacks). In Wakanda, a near-Utopia kingdom in Africa whose mind-boggling technological advancement is hidden from the rest of the world, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) becomes King upon the death of his father (see ""Captain America: Civil War"" for details of the assassination) after defeating a challenge to combat in accordance with tradition. His rule initially goes smoothly as he is loyally supported by mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), mentor Zuri (Forest Whitaker), technology wiz-kid sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), ferocious warrior General Okoye (Danai Gurira) and ex-girlfriend comr spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o). Then a crisis develops upon the emergence of an evil arms dealer Klaue (Andy Serkis, in his ""human"" face) who is inexplicably in possession of a small quantity of vibranium, Wakanda's national treasure, a rare metal that can be used to construct the most formidable weaponry. With the help of friendly C.I.A. operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), T'Challa and company tries to capture Klaue. This in turn leads to deeper secrets of something that happened when T'Challa was a child, something that Zuri has been at great pains to hide from him. The key villain finally emerges, one Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who, laying claim on direct bloodline, challenges T'Challa for the throne. So much for the aforementioned ""bare backbone"". The rest of the plot unfolds more or less as expected. Ryan Coogler, director of ""Creed"" (2015), the successful continuation of the ""Rocky"" legend with a tonal and theme variation, brings the same skill and touch to ""Black Panther"". No movie in this genre can succeed without pleasing the expectant audience with exciting action sequences, and ""Black Panther"" certainly misses nothing there. But what puts this movie a cut above the others is the heart-breaking pathos that Coogler brings, and Jordan (the lead in ""Creed"") delivers.But, don't get me wrong. If you are looking for fun and laughs, you get plenty in ""Black Panther"". When Ben Whishaw took over as the second generation ""Q"" in ""Skyfall"", you might think that this sort of superhero-tech-support role (such as Morgan Freeman in ""Batman"") cannot get any cuter. I thought so too, until I saw Letitia Wright as baby sister Shuri in ""Black Panther"". The cast is splendid, Wright being one among them. Boseman has earned his place, now firmly established, with the superheroes. Jordan delivers a villain that has made critics cry. Freeman brings with him a hint of the unique Bilbo mix of vulnerability and courage, plus a sprinkle of craziness. The four main supports, from two generations, are solid: Nyong'o, Gurira, Bassett, Whitaker. And it is good to see, once in a while, Serkis as neither an ape of a degenerated Hobbit. Many critics mention the political statement, which is loud and clear: survival with inclusion; and annihilation with isolation. Although it happens to be very relevant currently, this is not new to someone who is familiar with the great ""Foundation"" series of the late Isaac Asimov where the concept does not only encompass the Earth, but our entire Universe (there are billions of other universes that are potential threats to our existence)."
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2019,1/10,"Ok, seriously, Hollywood, what was the 'under the table' deal for this film to win so many awards?? The film suffers from bad acting (yet it won awards for acting), bad accents (most annoying!!), plot flaws deluxe, conveniences like you've never seen before, and inconsistent visual effects (yet it won awards for visual effects).I've heard a lot of negative reviews about the the film and went in with an open mind. I wanted to like the film, but hence, there was nothing to enjoy here. None of the actors, or characters, were believable. The plot and dialogue is terrible. The technology and inventions are outrageously silly (almost laughable). I can't get over how BAD the acting was, as if none of the actors truly believed in the film and therefore showed very little enthusiasm. The attempts at humor left very little to be desired. It was just corny and completely out of place. I also did not enjoy their racism remarks like ""Great! Another broken white boy to fix."" I wonder how many times I yawned or rolled my eyes during the first 30 minutes of the film... They also certainly know how to waste time in this film...Ok, some spoilers. In the beginning, Black Panther drinks a potion to strip him of his strength (as they did numerous times during the film in order to make him more vulnerable - how stupid!). Why did they even bother writing this scene where he is being challenged as king? It was so obvious he would win. Why would Ulysses agree to meet in a casino (of all places!!) to do his deal? (Oh, and Andy Serkis was so bad as Ulysses, I think he should rather stick to monkey business!). Nothing about this scene was believable. During all the fighting and shooting, you see a few people running about, but there's no panic. Even the bloody extras were bad!!Also, during the entire film Black Panther doesn't act like a king and no-one respects him like one. He is a very timid, pushover of a character. No back bone! Later, when Erik Killmonger challenges Black Panther and they fight, he throws Black Panther off the cliff, and then proudly proclaims he is the new king. He is then immediately crowned King. What!!!??? No-one even bothers confirming the Black Panther - their reigning king - is really dead??? They don't even bother to go look for him, find him, bury him??? Wow, that's loyalty towards your king!! If this was a silly kids cartoon it might have been acceptable but certainly not in a big budget film like this! This was just preposterous!!By the time the decent action arrived during the climax, I couldn't wait for the film to end. The climatic fight between Erik and Black Panther was also so painfully cliched and predictable - and then suddenly emotional (????!!!). 'Black Panther' toys with the viewer's emotions, but sadly this film didn't do anything for any of my senses. I hated this!"
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2020,8/10,"This film has a very intense and dark feel for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plot feels like a Shakespearean tragedy although some of this is probably due to direct influence from The Lion King. The highlight is probably the visual design and soundtrack which is really rousing. The low point is probably the shoddy special effects near the end. It grapples with some surprisingly mature historical themes but isn't exactly a full examination - did the villain really hope to provoke a black uprising in *Hong Kong*, of all places? Regardless of accuracy, it's one of the standout features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,"When Marvel first announced they would finally be giving their most popular African-based superhero a most overdue solo outing, audiences and critics alike clocked straight away just how important the film would be, not only in the superhero genre, but for mainstream film-making as a whole. In recent years, social media has raised huge question marks over an industry that had been, and still is, failing to honour both women and ethnic minorities in movies, with last year's Wonder Woman being the first superhero movie of note to tackle the issue head-on, delivering astonishing results in the process. Black Panther is not the first black superhero lead - see the likes of Spawn, Blade and Catwoman - but it is the first to truly celebrate African culture and specifically focus on the 'Black Experience'. The results are, again, truly astonishing.Marvel has unleashed a game-changer, and one that is well on its way to becoming one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. But this was never really in doubt when they announced that Ryan Coogler, the enormously talented director behind Fruitvale Station and Creed, would be behind the camera, and expectations then soared as soon as the jaw-dropping trailer hit, which was our first real look at the vibrant and fantastical fictional African country of Wakanda. With Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa aka the Black Panther introduced two years ago in Captain American: Civil War, Coogler has been spared the need for origin story mechanics and has free reign to explore this previously unseen world. The big joke is that the rest of the world think of Wakanda as a third-world country full of goats and farmers, when in fact their technological advancements put everyone else to shame. Yet they choose to keep their major discovery - a crashed meteor carrying mystical substance vibranium - a secret for generations. After a brief read of African history, you can understand why.So their country is a dazzling, futuristic sight, yet the Wakandans still honour the traditions of their ancestors. With their former king T'Chaka (John Kani) dead at the hands of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo, his son T'Challa has returned to Wakanda to receive his crown. He wants his old flame and active spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) there for his big day, and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a science boffin who trumps the likes of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner in terms of intelligence and innovation, teases her older brother. Despite an initial reluctance, T'Challa is a willing and capable leader, both politically and physically, able to defend any challengers without the aid of the enhance powers of the Black Panther. While the lack of having to watch the protagonist wrestle with their feelings as they step up to a bigger responsibility is certainly refreshing, the lack of any real arc for T'Challa is one of the very problems with Black Panther. With a supporting cast so vast and impressive, T'Challa often gets drowned out of his own story.Still, the supporting cast, which includes the likes of Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke, certainly deliver. Wright near steals the film, and Duke, as rival tribe leader M'Baku, makes a big impression in a relatively short amount of time. But a Marvel film wouldn't be complete without a big bad, and Michael B. Jordan's Eric Killmonger is easily their most complex, imposing and sympathetic since Loki. To say more about his character would be giving away spoilers, but Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole lay out his motivation and execution with real precision, and Jordan proves to be a thoroughly menacing presence. The cast, which is one of the best assembled in recent memory, help Cooger sculpt this fascinating world of progression and tradition, and even when the film can't help but indulge in a climax of CGI fisticuffs, you'll remain immersed because you'll care about the characters. Black Panther does something no other superhero has done before it - for me at least - and resonates long after the credits roll, proving timely in exploring the question of whether to build bridges or walls.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther was awesome and the triumphant king of Wakanda. First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this. The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world. The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music. Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets. Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"As is the case with the law of averages, the what some would call the law of the inevitable, we just keep waiting for the day in which Marvel makes the wrong move but that day continues to feel like a far off, near impossibility, as the superhero empire (with help from the Mouse House) continue to unleash quality and more risky products like it's no big deal at all.Continuing on the trend with what could well be their biggest risk from outside the normal yet, Ryan Coogler's Black Panther may not mess with the well-worn superhero narrative formula but thanks to Coogler's pitch-perfect direction, a brilliant cast that all seem committed and a passionate representation of African culture embedded into an otherwise generic set-up, this Marvel event is going to become a quick favourite of many right around the world.First appearing in this current format in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther see's Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther become king of secretive African nation Wakanda and fighting the good fight to keep his country's order in place while he tries to stop Andy Serkis's arms dealer Ulysses Klaue from trading into the precious commodity of vibranium and stop Michael B. Jordan's nefarious Killmonger from gaining anymore traction in his quest to make Wakanda his own.There's really nothing overly special about this story, one that plays out as you would expect it to, but Coogler who showed such talent with his debut Fruitvale Station and his bigger budgeted follow-up Creed instils his film with a true sense of heart and purpose and full-credit to him and Marvel for allowing Black Panther's roots in the African culture to take full effect here.Thanks to Coogler's guidance, the country of Wakanda and the beautifully realised settings and production design of Black Panther make it Marvel's most visually captivating film yet (sorry Ragnarok) and combined with a selection of Kendrick Lamar's tailored songs, this is Marvel at its most technically and aesthetically proficient.All this technical prowess and impressive direction would be for naught if Coogler and his ensemble failed to meet but as his proved with his previous films, Coogler once again shows himself a filmmaker well in-tuned to his actors.Led by the impressive Boseman, Black Panther's much-publicised predominately African-American cast all work together to create Marvel's best team-up outside of the Avengers and Guardians and the Galaxy, with a highlight coming in the form of Michael B. Jordan's key-bad Killmonger.Killmonger (real name Erik Stevens) is Marvel's most impressive villain outside of Loki, with Jordan doing a fantastic job at bringing this tormented and in some ways justified character to life and whenever his on screen, Black Panther elevates itself to greater heights.Killmonger's anger and resentment to what has happened to him and his people is more powerful than your average superhero alien looking to take over Earth for no real-reason and with this, Coogler's film has some powerful things to say about the world in which we live, not often the case with a comic-book adaptation.It's actually the films biggest downfall in many ways that it doesn't utilise Jordan more in its 2 hour plus runtime and had it managed to squeeze more of Jordan's escapades into its sometimes more slowly paced and methodical opening half, Black Panther could've become something undeniable and memorably special.Final Say - Re-writing the rulebook with its casting and socially relevant themes, Black Panther may not reinvent the superhero staple but it's a fresh and often exciting new addition to the Marvel universe that's deserving of its likely box-office dominance, making Black Panther a king well-deserving of its spot on the throne.4 armoured rhino's out of 5"
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2019,6/10,"Having seen the overwhelming critic reviews and overall success and accolades that this film has received, the hype for this Black Panther film was at a height that rarely many superhero films (even films of any genre)have amassed.This film is visually stunning, with great direction, and overall acting. Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,6/10,"The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2018,7/10,"Review:
After avoiding all of the spoilers, I finally got to watch this movie, which I quite enjoyed but I did think that Infinity War was better. I liked the fact that most of the cast was black, as it is based in Africa, and the way that the director had a lot of powerful women, which you don't see in a majority of superhero movies. The action scenes were also impressive and the cinematography was truly amazing but I did find the Black Panther quite moody and miserable through most of the movie. That's not to say that Chadwick Boseman didn't play the main character well, it's just that it lacked wit, and the storyline could have been a bit more interesting. Anyway, if you have seen Captain America: Civil War, you would have seen T'Challa/Black Panther, sadly losing his father, so in this movie you see him return to Wakanda, to assume the throne. His hometown is isolated from the world, mainly because of its advanced technology, powered by vibranium, During the ceremony, T'Challa is challenged by the Jabari Tribe leader, M'Baku (Winston Duke), who he successfully defeats and becomes king. Meanwhile Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) steal a Wakandan artefact from a London museum, and Klaue tries to sell it in South Korea but the deal is interrupted by the Black Panther and 2 of his close companions. During the battle, Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) is badly hurt whilst saving T'Challa's friend, so they take him back to Wakanda, so they can use there technology to save him, even though they don't want to expose there abilities to the outside world. T'Challa then finds out that his father killed his brother to save Wakanda, and he left his nephew in America at a young age. As Klaue knows the secret about the power of vibranium, the Wakanda's have tried to get there hands on him for years but he always seems to slip through there fingers. Erik, who turns out to be the young kid who was left in America, knows that the Wakanda's want Klaue, so he kills him and he uses his dead body to get into Wakanda. After exposing his true identity, he challenges T'Challa to a battle for the throne, which he successfully wins, thinking that he has killed the Black Panther. With Erik in power, he attempts to distribute Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world, not knowing that T'Challa was picked up by fishermen after being thrown into a waterfall. His mother, sister and girlfriend decide to leave Wakanda when Erik took power, and they make there way to the Jabari Tribe to take cover. They then see a badly beaten T'Challa in a coma, so they use some herbs to bring him back to life. Now fully revived, the Black Panther decides to take back Wakanda from Erik, before he distributes the weapons but the tribe are forced to fight for the king, which means that he has to battle against his close friends. Will he claim back his beloved Wakanda or will Erik use his new powers to defeat him! I know that I might have made the plot sound really confusing but it will make sense when you watch it. I did find the leader of the Jabari Tribe, M'Baku, quite funny, and the Black Panthers sister, Shuri, and Nakia were brilliant. Martin Freeman seemed a bit out of place but I understand why he was put into the movie. For a third world country, there technology was unbelievable, and it put Tony Stark to shame, but I honestly don't think that we have seen it's full power yet. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and I can understand why there was so much hype surrounding the movie but I personally preferred Ragnarok. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ryan Coogler, 32, who also brought you Fruitvale Station and Creed. For his third movie, he has certainly smashed the box office, and he has established his name in Hollywood. With only one project in development, which is a drama called Wrong Answer, he's decided to put Michael B. Jordan in the lead again, like he did in Creed and Fruitvale Station. At such a young age, he was lucky to be chosen to direct and write this movie, and I'm sure that Marvel is happy with the outcome, as it is the 9th biggest film of all time. It is the highest grossing film from a black director and the second highest grossing film in 2018, being beat by Infinity War, so DC really do have a hard act to follow. It would have been a totally different movie if Wesley Snipes took the lead, which was planned in 1992 but it never materialised due to disagreements over the script.Budget: $210million
Worldwide Gross: $1.346billion (WOW!)Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi 
Cast: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Isaach De Bankole and Letitia Wright. 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"The story of Black Panther is an ueber-generic-bubble, zillion times already told (wow, a villain wants to conquer a kingdom!), boosted with some CGI, some good, some mediocre, but like e.g. the new Star Trek s*ht called Discovery the magic is gone, and my brain melts almost into nothingness watching that kind of stuff called blockbuster today.Btw: a panther is always black. So a black panther is a tautology if I remember my terminology right. There are no white, green or red panthers in the to mankind known universe, there is only one exception I know about, and that's the famous Pink Panther! And he beats the Black Panther easy in humor, in storytelling, even the grade of violence is superior ;)I suspect there is a global conspiracy to kill all of mankind by boredom or mutate us into brain-dead zombies. But for my redamption and safety of my sanity I got some copies of Pink Panthers great adventures.Final words: Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam (Cato, the Elder)."
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2019,2/10,"""Black Panther"" may be the most overrated movie of my lifetime. I'm truly shocked that people thought this movie deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. About half way through the movie I was seriously trying to figure out if it was an unfunny comedy or a failed parody of some kind. Correct me if I'm wrong but this may be the first movie in history that after tons of murder and mayhem the hero actually agrees with the villain. Wow, this movie actually sides with the bad guy (but not his methods, of course). Yikes. Shame on Disney."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,7/10,"The enormity of the pressure that has manifested over time for this film has been nothing short of extraordinary. Not just for Marvel Studios as they continue their effortless cinematic universe, but for the multicultural film industry. The biggest blockbuster featuring a predominantly black cast, I have to applaud every single contribution made...they never succumbed to the pressure and have produced one of Marvel's stronger chapters. T'Challa returns to Wakanda after the events of 'Civil War' and must prove to be a worthy successor to the throne. Meanwhile, the precious resources secluded in this region are slowly becoming noticed by other nations, to which a worthy adversary soon arrives to challenge T'Challa. We are presented with an ever present scale. Either securing an extremely powerful material for the benefit of one nation or distributing it to other countries to establish a sense of hierarchy. This subtle political message adds that additional layer of depth amidst the hectic action. Boasted by energetic engrossing performances from all cast members, and we have ourselves a successful blockbuster. The story surprisingly was thick with plenty of world building, memorable characters and a few shifts in motives that provide some complexity to the narrative. A barrage of humour, some jokes land and several lines do not...I'm looking at you whoever included ""What are those!?"". The fight choreography was well executed, particularly during the ritual challenges. The visual effects were put to good use, Wakanda's architecture and technology was creatively inventive. The human CGI still remains mediocre, and is ridiculously noticeable during the final battle. The soundtrack masterfully blends African drums with American beats, highlighting modern and cultural significance. Oh, and finally a villain that just doesn't want to destroy the world. How refreshing. It really does come to no surprise that Marvel Studios continue their current dominance in blockbuster cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2019,6/10,"Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."
BLACK PANTHER,17 September 2018,3/10,"I dislike movies which are made just to make a quick buck. This is what Black Panther is as a movie. The infamous comic book hero who was for many decades a side story to other super heroes. The creators of this movie could have done better but they dropped the ball.As I watched the first few minutes of the movie and the dialog started to move forward, I realized the entire movie and how the ending was going to take place. I could see the deliberate conflicts and who would later become the antagonist. Actually there were several of them, but there is a main one who goes to the very end of the movie.The movie is completely superficial. The script lacks any depth. The characters are hollow. The plot is predictable.The only thing worth my time was the special effects and even that was restricted to a select number of scenes.Physics were ignored. Character development was tossed. Realism took a back seat to special effects.Overall, the movie is blah. It's supposed to be full of color and excitement but I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. A complete disappointment."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther uses the superhero genre to have conversations we're all currently having: ""Should we serve our country with blind commitment, or push back against the forces that are destroying it?"" ""Should we use our resources to protect our people, or help others in need?"" That deep interest in societal culture is in every frame of Marvel's latest venture. To be sure, it's a celebration of black culture, and a bright and proud one at that. However, it's also a celebration of culture in general, an awards assembly giving medals to those who lean into their own history, even while improving it. Those themes help Black Panther exudes confidence and power in even its quietest moments. 
Its vigor vibrates from the fictional country of Wakanda, a place so vibrantly beautiful and well-realized you'll wish to jump into the screen. The story of a prince-turned-warrior-king doesn't provide tons of plot-surprises or even a super compelling protagonist. Nevertheless, it soars in its emotionally exciting action scenes (waterfall ceremony), its stacked cast of characters (greatest superhero sibling ever?), and potent villain psychology.
Sure, Coogler has fallen into the Marvel trope of the hero having to fight the evil version of himself at the end of the film. It also follows the recent Marvel trend of creating villains who are empathetic and fully logical, to the point that you find yourself rooting for them. And with Jordan's Killmonger, we're shown one of the most rich and heartfelt antagonists in superhero history, making Boseman's Black Panther confront the truth in the film's line, ""It's hard for a good man to be king."" Thankfully, Black Panther knows that's a challenge worth taking. Wakanda forever."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,8/10,"Since it was announced, ""Black Panther"" has held the promise of something different from Marvel Studios. It's been 10 years since the Marvel journey began with ""Iron Man"" and the narratives, spectacles and formula are in perpetual danger of wearing thin. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed,"" ""Fruitvale Station""), ""Black Panther"" writes its own narrative into the tapestry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a thread that is both distinctive and familiar.""Black Panther"" has a lot in common with ""Thor"" with its hidden fantasy world and elements of near-Shakespearean palace intrigue, but most of the action takes place in the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda instead of out of it, making the film Marvel's biggest exercise in world-building to date. Coogler must foremost create a people, culture and society that we believe in and care about in as little time as possible. With production designer Hannah Beachler (""Moonlight,"" ""Creed"") and costume designer Ruth Carter (""Selma""), they create a colorful, vibrant and exciting Wakanda. No fictional place has seemed more appealing to spend time in since the ""Avatar"" world of Pandora.Yet that's purely the sci-fi/fantasy appeal of ""Black Panther,"" which really makes its mark with themes and narratives of extreme relevance, especially presented through this black lens. The film opens with a prologue in Coogler's native Oakland, tying the modern day black experience to the Afro-Futurist fantasy experience of Wakanda, a nation of smart, strong black people sitting on top of a ""gold mine"" of vibranium, the greatest source of power known to man. The film mostly focuses on how T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), newly minted king of Wakanda and also its guardian and protector, the Black Panther, wrestles with having leadership thrust upon him. At the same time, the secrecy and isolationist policy long held by his country faces new pressure and danger from the outside world from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). The story surrounds T'Challa with a team of strong minds and bodies (and terrific talents) including ex-girlfriend Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), tech-savvy sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and Wakandan General Okoye (Danai Gurira). There's also CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), who is a fifth as interesting as any of those characters and actually does amount to the token white guy. Outside of the superhero team-up films, it's Marvel's best ensemble.Yet perhaps all of them - even T'Challa - are overshadowed by Jordan's Killmonger, whose fascinating backstory and motivation make him Marvel's greatest villain success, or at least in that first tier with Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Michael Keaton's Vulture from 2017's ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" A villain with conviction and not just some unstoppable force trying to destroy the world, Killmonger makes ""Black Panther"" much more dramatic and interesting start to finish. He and T'Challa clash in personality and ideology in a satisfying way, one that's somewhat akin to Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. The film offers a buffet of action styles, from a ""James Bond""-inspired sequence in a Korean casino to a medieval fantasy battlefield brawl to the one-on-one fight scenes that echo some of Coogler's work in ""Creed."" It's a little all over the place and some sequences therefore work better than others. What's more important is most of the time, the stakes feel relevant even when the action gets messy.Carefully considered characters and themes, however, should account for most of ""Black Panther's"" success. That's how Coogler elevated ""Creed"" from among all the ""Rocky"" sequels and similar cliche-ridden boxing films. Creed's struggle was deeply personal and human. Nearly every character gets that same treatment here. Thematically, Coogler and Joe Robert Cole do not shy away from relevant black issues, even though the film explores them through fantasy rather than harsh reality. The Afro-Futurist fantasy of a powerful and influential black nation brings with it questions of responsibility that the movie devotes itself to contemplating and addressing. T'Challa must not only decide what kind of leader he wants to become, but reckon with the realities of a changing world. ""Black Panther"" triumphs not exclusively as an inspiration to black people wrestling with these same questions, but all of us can consider the fantasy of power and position and how we would use it. These notions distinguish the film from the rest of the Marvel Studios canon, not necessarily the more tangible storytelling and filmmaking elements. The film has weaknesses, many that it shares with other Marvel superhero movies, but those films cannot match its intellectual acuity and social consciousness.~Steven CThanks for reading!

BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"The 18th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another solid entry to the franchise but It's a testament to how far Marvel have pushed the concept of a ""Superhero film"" in the last couple of years that ""Black Panther"", which would have been amazing as little as three years ago, now feels a bit out-dated. Following the death of his father during ""Captain America: Civil War"", T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture. It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force. However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and ""Thor Ragnorok"", though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark. Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle. Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is the story of newly-crowned King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the sovereign of Wakanda, a hidden African nation secretly renowned for its technological supremacy and its hidden natural resources. T'Challa ascended to the throne after the assassination of his father during the events of Captain America: Civil War, but now he must face threats both from outside and within.Marvel, once again, does not fail us. This movie might very well be one of their best in terms of visual splendour and thematic depth. The nation of Wakanda opens in front of us bright with colour, resplendent in culture and history, representing the whole spectrum of African art and creativity. Add in some really cool action and chase scenes, some cool new tech gizmos, some quality acting - some really high-end quality acting, to be truthful - as well as some really poignant questions about the responsibility of the haves towards the have-nots, and you have the makings of a great movie.Unfortunately I do think that the latter half of the film drops the ball. Most of the events after they return back to Wakanda are... clich√©d. There's really no other word for it. As soon as Michael B. Jordan's character sets foot on Wakandan soil, I could tell minute by minute, almost line by line, what would happen. And that's not a good thing. Sometimes you can make such an obvious, clich√©d plot work, but this is not one of those cases. For example, there's this battle scene in the middle of the film. You know how these stories go. One of them is going to lose, because that's how the story works. So why should you care, at all, about this fight? What's at stake here? Nothing at all, that's what.Black Panther is a good film. The characters are some of the best we've seen from Marvel, as are the visuals. I just wish they had had the creativity to move beyond obvious formulas and story clich√©s in the latter part of the story. Still, very much a film worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,14 November 2019,7/10,"The character of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. In it T'Challa was the prince of Wakanda, a mysterious African nation whose technological supremacy has been carefully hidden for centuries. Unfortunately the events of Civil War rob T'Challa of his father and now he's to be crowned king. But there are those that dispute his worthiness.We'll talk about the story in a bit, but if there's one thing Black Panther absolutely nails it's production design. How the film looks, how the costumes are made, what kind of backgrounds are used. That stuff. Because by the heavens if this film isn't one of the most gorgeous pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And from what I've read, they went to great lengths to represent different regions of Africa, giving them voice and visibility. Which has been well-received, I'm glad to hear.Although, speaking of how the film looks, there is one aspect that could have been better. And that's the CGI elements. Those often look rather rubbery and fake, unfortunately, which is a shame because Marvel usually has had really good CGI.I also really like all the main characters. From Boseman's T'Challa to Letitia Wright's Shuri to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger to so many others. All great characters with interesting motivations and clearly established personalities. Killmonger especially is one of the all-time great Marvel villains. His struggle against Wakanda is born from something personal and identifiable rather than just from a lust to conquer and destroy. You don't agree with him, but you can see where he's coming from.That being said, I found the story itself to be formulaic. It telegraphs rather egregiously where it's going at any given moment and that lessens the tension. Sure, you have fun along the way, but you still watch the film and wish it could have had the courage to do something different. For example, the battle scene near the middle of the film. Could have gone differently, which would have allowed some other characters to step in and make bad choices anyway. Which would have been more dramatic. But no, the winner wins, because of course he does. That's how these stories go.Still, Black Panther is a good movie. A veritable feast for the eyes, with great characters and a story which while by the numbers still delivers what you expect from it."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"This 2018 action film stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Martin Freeman based on the Marvel comics.
Boseman plays T'challa, a young man who becomes ruler of African

Soon, he meets dangerous, ex-soldier, Erik who wants to overthrow him

Stan Lee makes an amusing cameo as usual. Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown and Andy Serkis also appear. This is ok,

BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2019,9/10,"Black Panther is a 2018 Superhero African American film featuring an all African cast and tells the tale of a young Prince named T'Challa played by Chadwick Bozeman who's father tragically dies and he takes his place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. But when someone else(Micheal B Jordan) wants to take over can T'Challa save his people and mankind.Overall the visuals were stunning,the acting was top notch and the score was very good.I notice ALOT of similarities between this and The Lion King when I was watching this film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and is one to revisit again.Keep an eye out for Stan Lee and Buck from Captain America(end post scene)."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,4/10,"Somehow I have a feeling that director Ryan Coogler anticipated the success of his Black Panther as well as the dilemma he now finds himself in. As a newly minted member of (the almost all-white) film establishment, and (probably now) a multi-millionaire to boot, Coogler undoubtedly had to figure out a way to fend off accusations from his base, of being a ""sell-out."" He did this by crafting his Black Panther script along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole to appeal to the masses of ordinary African-Americans who don't belong to an exclusive club of rich people that Coogler has recently joined. 
Coogler accomplishes his appeal to the base first by embracing the idealistic, utopian vision of Africa in the form of the nation of Wakanda, a Marvel comics invention, that harks back to films from the 30s such as Lost Horizon, where a ""mysterious, harmonious valley"", dubbed ""Shangri-la,"" thrives, somehow protected merely by mountains and a large number of overarching clouds. 
The whole idea is to present a positive image of African culture (mainly for) African-American youth in light of a history of put-downs which began of course during slavery times, when horrible stereotyped images of black people were first introduced and subsequently proliferated. Unfortunately, the tendency now is to go to the other extreme, so the blacks of Coogler's Wakanda are all powerful due to possession of the magical Vibranium, the super metal that gives them the technology to not only compete with the former (white) colonial powers of the world, but to surpass them! 
The ascendancy of black power as depicted here is nothing more than wish fulfillment, and clashes with the true political history of Africa since each country achieved independence and threw off the yoke of their colonial masters after World War II. Coogler knows that the phony Wakanda is much more appealing with its lack of corruption and suggestion of complete female empowerment (he also throws in some completely out of place Star Wars-like spaceships just to prove he's as good as any established sci-fi director).  
By playing to the base, Coogler refuses to present a ""warts and all"" portrait of the African homeland and reinforces what amounts to chauvinism (excessive or prejudiced loyalty or support for one's own cause, group, or gender). Although Coogler holds up the tribal infighting in Wakanda as some kind of cause c√©l√®bre, it's really an unconscious admission that African history is not so wonderful. As Patrick Gathara writes in the Washington Post, Africa is represented here ""as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite, centered upon ""royalty and warriors"", whose fortune comes not from its citizens' skill or ingenuity, but from a ""lucky meteor strike."" 
Coogler's other strategy to win over the masses is to introduce a vengeful antagonist, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, the former protagonist star of Coogler's prior effort, Creed. Here, Jordan is much more effective playing the bad guy, since Coogler's protagonists apparently all tend to be rather bland (that includes the star of this film, Chadwick Boseman, who plays King T'Challah and the Black Panther (all rolled into one). 
We first meet Killmonger in a flashback when he's just a kid in 1992 Oakland, California. This is where his father is killed by T'Challah's dad after he's discovered working with the racist South African Ulysses Klaue, who is attempting to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. Killmonger holds a grudge into adulthood and is determined to seek revenge against his uncle and cousin (as well as all whites). 
Some may say that by Coogler using the name ""Killmonger"" (an obvious pejorative appellation), this suggests that he disapproves of the character's militant position. But think again. T'Challah doesn't finish Killmonger off at film's end-quite the contrary, he offers to save his life, if he only submits to eventual imprisonment. Killmonger instead takes his own life-Coogler views Killmonger's death as clearly tragic and obviously has sympathy for him.
By evoking some measure of sympathy for the villain, Coogler sets another bad example for impressionable youth, suggesting that Killmonger's position has merit. And what exactly is Killmonger's position? He seeks revenge (as well as hegemony over) all whites associated with the excesses of colonialism in an African past. This of course ignores the fact that the almost all of the nations of Africa have been independent for at least 50 years and are responsible for their own shortcomings which of course include (first and foremost), rampant corruption (not to mention subjugation of women and other human rights violations).
The strategy is of course to find a familiar scapegoat and deflect any calls for self-responsibility. Some may argue that Coogler is actually conflicted about this issue of revenge, especially because he depicts T'Challah as being conciliatory toward whites and seemingly rejects violence at film's end. But in actuality, Coogler's embrace of a Martin Luther King Jr. hero is merely done as a matter of expediency-he must suck up to the powers that be so they allow him into the exclusive film fraternity which he craves to be part of. In a sense, T'Challah's actions are almost a footnote-down deep, Coogler's real sympathies remain with the masses of deluded militants-with their puerile (and self-destructive) call for vengeance.
When one looks closely at Coogler, one sees a very technically capable director who will remain a mediocrity as long as he continues to suck up to the mass of deluded chauvinists who embrace vengeance as a means of solving the sorry legacy of slavery and racism in the United States today."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,4/10,"I remember being disappointed when 'The Dark Knight' wasn't nominated for Best Picture ten years ago, but also understanding that superhero movie aren't really what the Oscars are intended for. So when I saw 'Black Panther' had been nominated I thought it must be a truly incredible film and was looking forward to seeing it. What I got instead was a painfully boring, unoriginal and uninspired movie that shouldn't be anywhere near a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.I've seen some boring superhero movies in my day but this would be near the top. Twice I had to pause the movie and have a nap because every time I would try to watch it would put me to sleep. There wasn't one character I felt any connection to or interest in. The hero was bland and the villain was equally so.I can only think this nomination refers back to the #Oscarsowhite controversy of a few years back and the Academy's determination to rectify that. It's a shame because there are some truly great and worthy films of 2018 that highly deserved a nomination in 'Black Panther's place. There are very few redeeming qualities about this film. I would not recommend giving up your time or hard earned on it."
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2021,9/10,"Black Panther (2018) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it came out. The storyline focuses on an African civilization that has kept itself isolated from the world and contains unique disciplines, scientific and societal advancements within their establishment. When an entitled young man with a troubled past has a different way he feels those virtues should be applied to the civilization's way of life, he decides to disrupt their equilibrium and take charge. Can the chosen king of the African civilization emerge and stop him? This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Chadwick Boseman (42), Michael B. Jordan (Just Mercy), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Angela Bassett (Vampire in Brooklyn), Forest Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) and Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out). The storyline for this has a lot of depth on social and perception issues. I really enjoyed the depiction of the female's strength and their lack of backing down for what's right. They were probably the best part of the movie. The backdrops and special effects were out of this world. The supporting cast with the various subplots were very well done. This picture was executed in a very thorough fashion, whether it was the outstanding fight sequences, issues that need to be overcome, or how their fictitious perceptions of society is something our society badly needs. Overall this is an outstanding movie, especially for being a super hero film, and I can't wait for a sequel. My only complaint was how weak Black Panther was as a super hero, but that is nitpicking. I'd score this an easy 9/10."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,7/10,"The Black Panther is a standard action movie with a predominantly black cast. Chadwick Boseman is the lead character and Lupita Nyongo the lead actress. They have good chemistry and the story is well written. It opens in Oakland, California and flashes back to a fictitious African nation with a super metal which has been hidden from the rest of the world for many years. Thhey fight with other countries and with themselves in this two hour and fourteen minute epic. The CGI is top notch but the film could have used some editing, as it feels a bit too long. Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy an adventure in order to escape the every day realities of life."
BLACK PANTHER,19 September 2018,6/10,"I felt guilty disliking ""Black Panther' because, like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), there was so much media focus on the supposed social significance of the film. The entire plot revolves around 'vibranium', a fictional unobtainium-like element in the MCU, out of which you can make anything that the plot requires or that would look cool on film. Wakanda, a hidden paradise in the heart of Africa, sits on a mountain of the miracle metal and therefore has technology, including weaponry, far beyond anything else on the planet (outside of Tony Stark's workshop and similar MCU hero/villain enclaves). The Black Panther is the super-powered king of Wakanda, whose costume can be stored in a necklace, allowing him to change instantly (where his civilian clothes go is not clear to me, but certainly the tightfitting cat suit can't be worn over his Savile Road suit) and, as The Black Panther, he can do pretty much anything (regardless of physics). Despite its sophisticated technology, the rulership of Wakenda is decided by brawling, so we end up with two Black Panthers: a good one and an evil one (maybe semi-evil, as he seems to be possessed by murderous good-intent if you are a fan of race-wars). Needless to say, this narrative bifurcation is resolved by a huge melee and a Black Panther mano a mano (easily the worst part of the film from a CGI perspective). Even by MCU standards, most of the characters are pretty much cut-out dolls (especially T'Challa's trite Q-like sister) with the exception of Micheal B. Gordons ""Kill Monger"", an implausible but at least interesting character. As these sorts of movies go, 'The Black Panther' is fine. The look is novel but the script and story are pretty typical of the genre, so perhaps ground breaking in the sociocultural world of big-budget comic book adaptations but otherwise, not much new. Maybe I just don't get it, but Wakanda is this incredibly wealthy enclave in Africa but these elite 1%ers don't seem willing to do anything to help out their troubled continent. I can accept ethical reasons for not using their hyper-advanced weaponry to solve Africa's problems but there seems little excuse not to surreptitiously assist with their hyper-advanced medical technology (I suspect that these are awkward questions best avoided in a movie based on a comic book in which they are the 'good guys')."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"The Marvel universe just keeps expanding here, in every good way. After Chadwick Boseman first appeared has the Black Panther in Captain America Civil War, you knew like Wonder Woman it would not be long before he would get his own movie. I heard back in the 90's they where trying to get a Black Panther movie in hopes it would starring Wesley Snipes in the title role, but it did not happen and Wesley Snipes went on to play another Marvel character known has Blade.
So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B. Jordan has the villain Killmonger, and the rest cast do well also. I'm looking forward for more Black Panther films in the future."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,,"With his father T'Chaka having passed away, T'Challa finds himself as heir to the throne of Wakanda and responsible for leading his people as the new king-a role which he is reluctant to embrace. He returns home to prepare for his coronation until he finds his sovereignty challenged by both internal and external factions, and must seek help from some unlikely sources to prevent a conflict which could have global repercussions. Innovative, well-crafted, and culturally significant entry to the Marvel Universe is a feast for the eyes with beautiful, breathtaking scenery, strong, captivating characters, but most importantly it's a very personal and compelling story with political overtones that raise serious, penetrating questions about the modern world. Though the pace lags at times it still holds your attention and is perfectly cast across the board with Boseman poised and centered in the lead, Jordan matching him as a physically imposing counterpart, along with Nyong'o, Gurira, and Wright who are all terrific. ***"
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2019,7/10,"7/10 - loved the African cultural elements, but I felt like the villain storyline could have been built up more"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"I saw ""Black Panther"", starring Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, Draft Day; Michael B. Jordon-Creed, Fantastic Four_2015; Lupita Nyong'o-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave; Danai Gurira-The Walking Dead_tv, All Eyez On Me and Andy Serkis-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, The Lord of the Rings movies.
This is based on a comic book hero that has been around since 1966, when he made his first appearance in a Fantastic Four comic. FYI: His debut was about 2 months before the militant Black Panther Party made their debut, so there was no connection between the two. Chadwick plays T'Challa, the son of the King of Wakanda, an East African country that is more than it appears to be. They have a precious metal called Vibranium that powers their whole country. They use it for all sorts of technological wonders; weapons, transportation, medicinal, etc. Vibranium can absorb and then refocus energy and it was even used in making Captain Americas' shield. When his father dies-as seen in Captain America:Civil War, Chadwick's first cinematic appearance-Chadwick returns to become King, and the new Black Panther, as was his father before him. That's when multiple problems start hitting the fan. First, Andy steals some Vibranium and Chadwick has to try and stop him-the policy of Wakanda is to keep their high technology a big secret from the outside world, so as to prevent misuse of the metal. Then Michael shows up, claiming to be the rightful heir to the Wakandian throne and challenges Chadwick to a fight. Lupita plays Chadwick's love interest and Danai is the head of security for Chadwick. Stan Lee pops up in his customary cameo-look for him in the casino scene-and there are 2 scenes at the end. The first is right after the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, so make sure you stay until the very end-it has a familiar character show up.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and a rude gesture and it has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.
As you might guess, I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2019,6/10,"It seems like Marvel movies are intent of developing invincible villains and heroes to stand against them through some combination of extraterrestrial god powers, magic, or incredible technology. In this case, it is a magical herb and a magical metal. We've seen vibranium before but now they've added magical healing powers and who knows what else. Throw in the fact that a relatively small nation has hidden technology that appears to be dozens, if not hundreds, of years ahead of the world. And I don't even want to talk about the political undertones.Kudos for not having scenes that fictionally destroy millions upon millions of dollars of infrastructure and vehicles not to mention potential lives in major cities. There is still plenty of cold-blooded killing and a villain whose only character trait is hatred. When the big bad battle takes place, it's fought with weapons that appear on the outside to be medieval technology but really pack a futuristic whollop.The action and graphics are first rate, as always with Marvel. The acting is stilted for the most part. There is a story, but it's a pretty old one with no surprises.The movie also avoids one of my pet peeves with several of the latest Marvel movies. I have complained elsewhere that I want my superheroes to be like the old-fashioned Superman - people with integrity. The true Black Panther in this movie does that pretty well, even if he has some minor flaws."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"I believe that I was 20 and in college when I first came across the Black Panther, the first black superhero of any historical significance and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in 1966 (and whose creation pre-dates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party), and in the adventure I read about he was searching the world for his future bride - and eventually found her in the Kenyan Ororo Munroe/Storm (of the X-Men). In his travels, he also came across other noteworthy black superheroes including Brother Voodoo, Luke Cage/Power Man, The Falcon, Monica Rambeau/Pulsar and my personal favorite superhero of color, the vampire hunter Blade.(As most readers of my reviews know, Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero.)This was 12 years ago, I would say, and the Black Panther has come a long way since then.Ryan Coogler's (""Fruitvale Station,"" ""Creed"") ""Black Panther"" arrives in a 2018 dominated by racial and social debate (and controversy) - not unlike the time that the Black Panther character first debuted at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1960s. The Black Panther first appeared in a two-part origin story - ""Fantastic Four #52"" and ""Fantastic Four #53"" (July 1966-August 1966) - and there he single-handedly defeated the Fantastic Four in order to test his skills in preparation for his battle with his arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaw. Black Panther later became one of the Fantastic Four's closest allies, as well as a member of the Avengers.""Black Panther,"" the film, has many firsts going for it. It would be the first superhero film with a black director (Coogler), the first superhero film with a largely black cast including strong portrayals of black femininity (and featuring white actors in roles usually reserved for minorities), the first superhero film to display an entirely fictional African culture and civilization in a positive non-stereotypical light, and of course it's a superhero film about the first black superhero ever created (and the first black comic book character that was ALSO not a racist stereotype). It achieves many of its objectives, even if every now and then it slips into some of the corniness and silly comedy that I believe has come to define many modern superhero movies since Disney acquired Marvel nearly a decade ago.""Black Panther"" is in some respects quite different from most big-budgeted superhero epics of late. The film has a decidedly political slant to it, which I see that some viewers have already commented negatively about. This doesn't give me some of the pause that it should have, and, after viewing the film for myself, I saw that these politics aim to address a key issue that I've often wondered myself about the Black Panther, and his home country - the fictional African nation of Wakanda, which is the most technologically advanced civilization on Earth.The Black Panther is, of course, the King of Wakanda, and his real name is T'Challa (played here by the mesmerizing Chadwick Boseman). In ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), that was where the Black Panther was first introduced into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and in his first outing his father, the previous Black Panther and king of Wakanda, was killed in a terrorist bombing. Now as the new king of Wakanda, T'Challa finds himself tasked with the enormous burden of being leader to his country and his people, who have remained socially isolated from the rest of the world and become the most technologically advanced country not just on the African continent, but possibly the whole world.Wakanda has managed to thrive, and survive, hundreds of years without having to face the horrors of colonization and exploitation by outside forces, by those who want what has led to Wakanda's vast wealth and technological prowess - the alien metal vibranium. But all this is about to change with the arrival of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). But Klaue is merely a puppet in the scheme of Erik Stevens (Coogler regular Michael B. Jordan), a former U.S. military black ops mercenary and hired assassin who now goes by the name ""Killmonger,"" to lay claim to the Wakandan throne. It turns out that Killmonger also has a tragic connection to the Black Panther's past.I have to say that I was quite well impressed by ""Black Panther."" Some of the early comments I had heard about the film were proven true. The one that stuck out to me the most was the villain Killmonger. Going back to what I said earlier about this film's politics, the character of Killmonger presents an argument about his motivations for villainy that are hard to counter: he forces Wakanda to face up to its greatest moral contradiction, which is its isolationism. His goals are just as much personal as they are political, and this gives him some much-needed dramatic and emotional dimensions to not make him seem like so many bland and poorly defined super-villains of recent memory. That is what I appreciated most in Michael B. Jordan's ruthless, yet ultimately sympathetic, portrayal of such a dangerous and fascinating character.The film has the usual sensational special effects-driven action scenes that are cool-looking but tend to distract from a film outing that had a lot of firsts going for it, and could have been very different from most other superhero films of the last decade. (Coogler, as the film's co-screenwriter, was at least wise enough to not serve up every other piece of dialogue as a punchline.) The Black Panther, to me, would have worked a lot better if it was a stand-alone picture and not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what can I do?Ultimately, ""Black Panther"" did not disappoint. Ryan Coogler had a huge task ahead of him when he made this film and despite a few faults, he delivered. ""Black Panther"" will undoubtedly win the weekend, if not an entirely new generation of young Marvel Comics readers.9/10"

As of this moment right now when I'm writing, I've just completed reading and rating ALL of the 764 other comments previously posted here. There is a wide range of opinion. Sadly, my personal slant is lacking, because I mentioned the current U.S. leader once in a relevant context to BLACK PANTHER, but I spelled his name correctly. About a dozen of the other BLACK PANTHER remarks make some allusion to this individual (which begs the question of why MORE of them do not, since BLACK PANTHER does NOT exist in a political vacuum; it's probably the MOST political flick of 2018!), but the difference between what was nixed from me and posted from others was that they all misspelled the name of the Free World's leader. Evidently, this part of the web is being monitored by trolls whose mission in life is to create a fantasy world in which BLACK PANTHER exists, but not POTUS. I was able to salvage a copy of my suppressed observations (which I forwarded to my Congressman, along with this page as well), and will be passing them out on the street of a major city in a few minutes.

BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is a generic super hero semi sci-fi grounded on earth featuring the offbeat casting of an all black cast in the first feature of another Star War's franchise.

C'halla would like to promote the technology to help oppressed people throughout the world but it has fallen into the wrong hands and his attempts to retrieve it are being distracted by challengers from the throne; first from the imposing mountain people and then a crass one man war machine from the USA by the name of Kilmonger (Michael B. jordan). Kilmonger is no pretender to the throne however and is allowed rightful challenge to the crown.Panther breaks no new ground as the first all black Hollywood production but it certainly is a step forward in the evolution of the black film in Hollywood from the well intentioned Halleluah (29) to the talent laden Cabin in the Sky ( 43) to the abysmal The Wiz. Unlike the cliches, the patronizing and mocking (in the case of The Wiz just an incredible waste of talent) Black Panther maintains its dignity from end to end but most importantly offers a welcome twist to the Marvel franchise to film in setting, character and plot.Boseman is an approachable an amiable breath of fresh air without the stilted stoicism as the super hero, his actions involving a lot more familial activity with a precocious sister to play off as well as have a partner with a backbone. This well grounded humanity may serve him well in future episodes, creating problems and missteps on his part, causing him to drop his guard when it calls for steel resolve, enabling for chaos and confrontation and allowing the action fantasy film to do what it does best in this age of technology, speed, blowing things up and super human effort in making the Universe a better place."
BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,7/10,"After so many deeply interconnected chapters, it's relieving to see a film in the MCU that doesn't require much previous knowledge to enjoy. Referencing the preceding (and forthcoming) films in Marvel's repertoire only fleetingly, Black Panther is a largely self-contained, by-the-numbers superhero flick. Which works both for it and against it. In one respect, that enables the entire cast to establish themselves. Safe from the need to constantly pay homage to Tony Stark or Thanos, Panther's supporting players thrive and King T'Challa himself goes through a complete character arc. On the other hand, it often feels like we've been here before. Maybe not specifically, as the film goes to great lengths to set up Wakanda as a unique culture with authentic customs, but certainly thematically.As a ""back to basics"" approach with well-timed, socially conscious values, it functions very well. Its flavor is like nothing else we've seen from Marvel so far - a bright, optimistic blend of tech and nature that really works - and the wide diversity of the on-screen population is both effective and appropriate.A complete, enjoyable new entry in the publisher's stacked catalog of characters, and a short breath of fresh air, if not a complete breakthrough."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,8/10,"After his appearance in Captain America civil war I was so excited to see Black panther reappear and I have now seen this film and i really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees prince t'challa return to the secluded technologically advanced african country of wakanda to become king, when he is challenged with threats foreign and domestic. Chadwick boseman reprises the role as t'challa and He is fantastic in the role, he plays the charismatic leader very well but even more he delivers a great mix of humour and drama to this rich character. The supporting cast is one of the best assembled in marvel history so let's start with Michael b Jordan who plays the villain in this film and I found his characters journey to be one of the more interesting parts in the film and made me care about the conflict between him and t'challa. Lupita nyongo plays a love interest in this film but she is a very strong character, also her and bosemans chemistry is really good in this film and you enjoy there flirting. Danai guirra of walking dead fame plays the head of the kings guard and she is great in this film, she is great in the majority of action scenes and is a well fleshed out character in this film. In my opinion the show stealer in this film and most surprising performance by Letitia Wright who plays his sister Shuri in this film, she isbhis tech specialist and I just loved her charm and she really added a lot of energy to her role to make her such a likeable character. Martin Freeman, Andy serkis, Angela Bassett and forest Whittaker all do well in there smaller roles. The story has a great coming of age story here for t'challa and it is really interesting to see this countries uniqueness and there tribes diversity. I also liked the way the villain tied to the hero as it felt real and personal to watch. But there is a portion of the story I didn't really like which I can't talk about due to spoilers. The script has a brilliant mix of humour and drama that gave this film the best of both worlds, it was funny when it needed to be but dramatic when it needed to be. The style of the film has some really unique looking sets with great use of technology and colours to make this film stand out. Though I feel like especially towards the end of the film the action relies overly on CGI and it doesn't look that good especially for a film in 2018. Overall black panther is a great film that should be seen especially if you love these marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2018,10/10,"I rather like this movie and if the central plot was a little bit less Hamlet I would have loved it. Don't get me wrong the central plot is engaging it just goes where you expect it to go at all times. The work done in both the writing and technical aspects to develop Wakanda as multilayered society rife with factions and internal conflicts is really cool and if nothing else the film makes you want to spend more time with this group of characters. I simply loved the art direction and costumes in this. It was like pan-African version of Lost Horizon.The real standout was Killmonger. Easily Marvel's best and most compelling antagonist he is at once a righteous zealot, a fallen idealist and a twisted version of the hero. The writing coupled with Jordan's charismatic and forceful performance renders a perfect anti-villain to love. I hope they bring him back somehow.Much has been made of the film featuring a nearly exclusively black cast. I think that is a rather shallow reading of the text. The film absolutely does contain parallels and commentary on the African diaspora and the African American experience but it goes beyond simply casting black people. It is really hard to not hear the implicit rebuke of Trumpianism in the final speech and character arch of Wakanda and her King. Like Winter Solider and Iron Man 2 the film contain pretty overt political material. It is a deeper more engaging film because of it."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,7/10,"(Flash Review)This super hero movie felt fresh for me. New characters, locations and styles. It actually had a solid and meaningful plot as well. T'Challa, (AKA Black Panther) returns to Wakanda to. Part of the swearing in ceremony is that challengers from local areas in the country are allowed to respectfully battle him to take his throne. There are some really neat fight scenes around that part of the movie. Later and based on some historical revenge another challenger is granted his chance to fight for the throne. This new challenger will lead the country into war while T'Challa hopes aims to protect his people. Overall, the story was coherent and the battle scene graphics high quality. For those who like super hero characters and are tired with seeing Iron Man show up everywhere, this is refreshing."
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2021,7/10,"This movie was heavy on battle and action scenes and had an ok plot, and could have used more in that area. I loved the cast and characters, especially the title, and Chadwick Bozeman was terrific in the lead. I think this was a showcase for the title character and was not too bad. If you are into superhero movies with a bit of a thin plot and lots of action, this is the movie for you! I was not disappointed.** 1/2 out of ****"
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2021,8/10,"T'Challa ascends to the throne of Wakanda and takes the mantle of Black Panther.This is an entertaining and thought provoking superhero origin story with a number of solid performances.The plot is reasonably strong with a structure that resembles a mashup of The Lion King, James Bond and traditional Marvel heroism. For me the best aspect of it are the political and social themes that underpin the characters and their motivations. To have a story so explicit about the historical treatment of African peoples and the plight of African communities around the world as a main stream cinematic event is a breath of fresh air.There are numerous strong, positive, non-clich√©d, male and female African characters, in a movie led by an African Marvel superhero. The main protagonist journeys through an arc that leads him to an important decision that impacts the entire world. The antagonist is complex and fighting a cause worth fighting for, but in the wrong way. Through this it delivers an important message that is very relevant in today's divided world.Within the seriousness there is a lot of humour through dialogue and performances. Shuri has some great moments of witty banter along with Everett Ross and M'Baku.The visuals are for me a mixed bag. I love the cinematography, colours, lighting and editing in many scenes. Whilst the effects are brilliant in some parts I find the CGI action spectacle at times to be cartoonish, distracting and over the top. This for me hurts a film that carries such importance, as the messages get lost in mess of video game type spectacle.On a more positive note, the performances from all cast are excellent. Chadwick Boseman is every inch the title character, whilst Michael B Jordan is up there with the best of the Marvel antagonists. The supporting cast are superb with Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya and Martin Freeman all perfect in their respective roles."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2021,8/10,"Black Panther is an action, adventure Sci-fi super hero movie directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Late Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis.This is the 18th film in Marvel Cinematic Universe.A new vibrant and much advanced universe is introduced and this movie is not only visually appealing but also a perfect superhero marvel movie that was the need of the hour.This movie is much different from it's previous movies in many aspects as the approach towards the movie was little different from all the previous marvel movies. The execution of the movie is also strong and with the help of great CGIs the movie is indeed entertaining.Acting is very strong and Late Boseman was the most shining star amongst all of them. Michael B. Jordan was equally effective, rest of the cast were equally impressive. The cinematography is another strong aspect of the movie and must be appreciated.Screenplay is fast paced and will keep you engaged, music of the movie is strong and climax is perfect. This movie is indeed a great entertainer. A must watch."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2020,6/10,Okay Marvel comic book film but a little to political for my taste. It's more like Star Wars meets The Patriot. Maybe if this had some more action then just fighting for the King title it would have been more interesting.
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,,"This is one of the best super hero movies. Which still makes it pretty much crap. The actors are beautiful. The special effects and designs are special. And probably 10 years from now every TV film will have the same.The script is the same mumbo-jumbo of blindly obey the true king. And the true king is the one that can kill the other king. No brain, no reason, just obedience. And Hollywood is doing a better job than Stalin's party komissars.On the plus side, the creepy old man, Stan Lee will probably come no more on screen, unless some of his fan base is going to digitally restore him."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2021,8/10,"Enjoyed that!'Black Panther', the 18th MCU film, is very good. I really like the world building of Wakanda, as well as the cinematography and costume design. The cast are, as expected, excellent as well.Chadwick Boseman is terrific as T'Challa, as I knew he would be based on the glimpse we see of him in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. He is the best actor here, but Danai Gurira runs him close. I'm a huge fan of Gurira's due to her performances in 'The Walking Dead' so knew I'd rate her here too, she's fun to watch - it's cool to see her weapon-wielding once again.Elsewhere, Lupita Nyong'o is good and so is Letitia Wright; she's great in 2015's 'Urban Hymn', which I had seen her in previously. It's a fairly stacked cast, with the likes of Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya and Michael B. Jordan also appearing; Jordan's character isn't the best, but he himself is more than solid."
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2020,10/10,"I have no idea what complete moron would give this a 1or 2 like I read, they wanted another cheezy marvel movie with an over buffed heroe instead of the amazing actor Chadwick boseman!! This movie is amazing it shows a heroe flawed but still wins in the end it showed a super heroe with an actual conscience and morality. I'm writing this after seeing this movie for the 5th time as with Chadwick recently passing away after a true super heroe fight with cancer. That however has no bearing on my review, watch it again and see his acting for what it is and was!! Truly a gift to see and a gift to us to have the honor to watch this great movie!! Also incredible 3d bluray!!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2020,9/10,"Another outstanding Marvel movie & definitely one of the greatest of the lot, it's like a modern big budget Blaxploitation movie & it's fantastic!!!This movie will be a modern Masterpiece, a dazzling work of art & a special piece of Cinema in time, most do call it an instant CLASSIC already.A powerful piece of fantasy sci-fi that must be so beautiful for people of colour all over the world. I loved it & consider ""Black Panther"" to be definitely one of the best Marvel has made.Chadwick Boseman Is an icon, a legend of Cinema for his iconic role here & he always stole the show when he turned up in the Avengers films.R. I. P to one of the greatest actors of his generation, Boseman was a powerful presence on screen, a man who seemed both calm & in control & also seemed lost, lonely & hurt, maybe it was his weary eyes or the seriousness in his facial expression but all i know is he stood up as one hell of an interesting leading man!!!For me his ""Trilogy"" of Great movies that i will definitely remember him for are the special super hero mega hit, BLACK PANTHER, his excellent gritty & dark revenge Thriller, MESSAGE FROM THE KING & his exciting & slick action Cop Thriller, 21 BRIDGES, all great films & excellent roles for one of the best performers out there!!!Cinema & the world has lost a great man.""Black Panther"" was such an Awesome & interesting character when he popped up in the other Marvel films as a side character & here he gets his own Amazing movie.Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther & brings his level of calm & coolness to his own fantastical adventure that plays like a super cool Spy flick adventure. Everything in this movie is a feast for the eyes as the design of the Wakanda is absolutely beautiful & visually stunning to look at!!! The production design is outstanding & the futuristic city is just amazing. Black Panther had a huge budget like all the Marvel films so it's top notch in every single department from the stunning cinematography to the Awesome & exciting music score, this is an epic super hero movie with one of the most Awesome looking & interesting Marvel characters ever!!!The huge cast is fantastic & the action scenes are spectacular, fresh & so exciting to watch, there's some funny moments & some deep moments but most of all ""Black Panther"" is an amazing fantasy adventure with Awesome fight scenes, cool gadgets & a mix of interesting characters.I heard all good things about this movie & excellent reviews & i have enjoyed pretty much all of the Marvel films so far, well i like some more than others & Black Panther is one of my faves of the MCU.Black Panther is rich with old ancient African culture & beautiful imagery, i movie that is powerful in it's vision & in it's story.Black Panther, is without a doubt one of the most impressive & spectacular looking movies I've ever seen especially within a ""Blockbuster"" superhero movie.Just sit back & enter the Amazing world of the Black Panther & Wakanda for a blast of exciting action packed adventure & a big visual treat.Black Panther may not be the absolute best of Marvels Movies but it's definitely one of the best & is probably Chadwick's best work as an actor in a leading role? Enjoy this fantastical adventure."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther: To the outside world Wakanda is a struggling country, caught in the past, dependent on agriculture with little to export. Little does the West know that in fact Wakanda is an advanced technological society, its industry and wealth built on the Alien metal Vibranium. The Black Panther gets his power from a flower grown in soil tainted by Vibranium ore. (This being an Absolute Monarchy only he gets to ingest the flower. Don't ask this is comic book territory).Following the death of King T'Chaka in the attack on the UN, T'Challa ( Chadwick Boseman) the Black Panther prepares to assume the throne. The kingdom maintains agents (War Dogs) in the outside world, one of whom is Nakia (Lupito Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover, who is currently undercover fighting slavers. This allows BP to show off his powers in a fight with the slavers aided by Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira) leader of his female Special Forces, the Dora Milaje. The DM protect the Royal Family and Wakanda from internal and external attack (and presumably disembowel any uppity oiks who are looking for an elected president and parliament).T'Challa and his sidekicks return to Wakanda for the Coronation ceremony where he has to take a potion stripping him of his powers before any possible challenge. He is challenged by M'Baku (Winston Duke), leader of the Mountain People. T'Challa triumphs and allows M'Baku to live. But there is a lost Prince of Wakanda on the loose abroad, N'Jadaka (Michael Jordan) AKA Killmonger. This Prodigal Prince teams up with the murderous Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) a B List Bond Villain. They loot/liberate museums in search for Vibranium and N'Jadaka returns to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa for the throne.Wakanda is a beautifully imagined country surrounded by mountains and rain forest, hidden by shields which cloak the true nature of the country. Challenges for the throne take place at the edge of magnificent waterfalls, top class CGI for the most part. Apart from it's War Dogs occasional interventions, Wakanda has stayed aloof from the struggles of the oppressed. N'Jadaka wants to change this by sending advanced weapons abroad. Civil War ensues, with even Vibranium clad rhinos involved.The Wakandan technology ranges from dragonfly like attack craft to maglev trains and photon/energy powered Vibranium weapons. There is a vast subterranean cavern complex where the manufacture and R&D takes place. Chief Scientist is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's teenage sister. In supporting roles we have Angela Bassett as the Queen Mum, Forest Whitaker as Zuri, a wise old Counsellor and Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. Ross is the butt of jokes as M'Baku roars: ""Silence or I'll feed you to my children! Only Kidding, we're vegetarians!"" Shuri comments: ""another broken white boy to fix"". as Ross arrives for medical treatment.This film works on several layers with the spectres of Colonialism, Neo-Colonialism hanging over the action sequences. The meaning and natures of International Solidarity is also examined but sadly the anachronism of an Absolute Monarchy existing in an advanced Technological Society is left unquestioned. Good fun though. 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,4 April 2019,8/10,I liked this more than I expected. Soundtrack was awesome and fitting. Acting was amazing (Jordan) and there was real struggle. A few plot holes but nothing that can't be overlooked. Well done.
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2021,7/10,"Although its visuals are top notch, as well as many other elements,Black Panther's script isn't up to the burden of an original superhero tale- and instead, ends up feeling too familiar to reach its full potential. First off i'll start with the films flaws. The film is incredibly predictable, and at times, I honestly couldn't take parts of it seriously. Its fight scenes in the first half of the film are very well executed, but the second half ends up feeling a bit tedious, and truly offering nothing but trying to find its way out of the hole it dug itself. It's disappointing to say the least, not that its bad, but it could have been something so much moe, and instead it just feels too by-the-numbers to truly stand out. As for the positives for the film, it is very visually pleasing to look at. The special effects are incredibly well done, and the costumes are fantastic- as well as the look of the film throughout. All the actors do an excellent job, most obviously Chadwick Boseman in his brilliant performance as King T'Challa and Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. We also get great performances from Lupita Nyong'O, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and of course Andy Serkis. In the end, Black Panther is hardly the action spectacle it could have been. I am so glad to see greater representation in the MCU, but in terms of writing, the film is just a bit too bland to spare.My Rating: 7.5/10."
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,5/10,"I'm really not a big fan of Marvels cartoonie flicks, so call me biased. That said, that bias had to come from somewhere and for me, its the general inanity and blandness of these kinds of films that is so off putting. Black Panther feels a lot like Action Man meets The Lion King. Its got a kind of unreal, simplistic , garishly optimistic feel to it, that is, I suspect, simply unconvincing for anyone over 14 years of age. The story is the usual basic adventure/action fare that's fraught with contradiction. Why an advanced society would embrace a medieval feudalistic model of rule based on a King makes little sense. Nor does the notion of it being hidden from the world behind a rather contrived force field. I'm sure none of the not so lucky locals, forced to live in simple huts, would be tempted to tell the world for some extra $$?The narrative is predictable. Comprised of shallow, basic dialogue and bland humour, designed to make the character's seem mildly believable.Really the action is the only place where this film shines. That, of course, is to be expected but is there any harm in injecting a little intelligence into the overall story rather than dumbing the thing down to the point where it could only really appeal to early teens?So whats left to say? Watchable on a very superficial level but really that is it. More one for the young than cynical worldly wise, old guys, like myself. 5/10 from me."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,10/10,"Black Panther 
One of the top five greatest superhero films ever made. Easily the best Marvel film to date and thankfully it lives up to the hype. Compelling story on all sides, a masterfully directed action adventure film that tackles one of the most ignored social issues of our generation. I can not say enough about this movie. All I know is that I literally want to watch it again right this second. There is so much to talk about but I'm keeping this spoiler free. So far and quite possibly - ultimately the best movie of 2018."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,7/10,"Black Panther has been an incredibly success for Marvel . Up to this weekend it had taken 1.2 Billion dollars and I'm not surprised. My kids have been pestering me for weeks to take them to see this . thanks to some brilliant social media marketing ( especially on YouTube) and today we finally got to see it .It's the story of T'Challa who is crowned the king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced country in Africa that has hidden itself away from the rest of the world. T'Challa is charged with defending the nation in his guise as the costumed superhero known as Black Panther, but his reign is challenged by a Wakanda dissident named Erik Killmonger , who wants to sell the country's natural resources to fund an uprising.I have to admit I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing this. I thought , because of the director and cast being predominantly black , that it might be more political than anything but it wasn't and to be fair it was just another enjoyable marvel movie.
The action is nothing new and it's too long . as all Marvel films are , but I liked it and more importantly my sons did too.
There are some good performances from Chadwick Boseman , Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis and I look forward to Black Panther linking up with a few of the more familiar Marvel super heroes."
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2021,8/10,"A great movie, truly! Such nice plot, and the performances, oh my God!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 December 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a powerful and bold Marvel movie that tackles weighty themes whilst also delivering the balance of humour and action normally associated with a Marvel movie. Chadwick Boseman gives an incredible and powerful lead performance with great supporting performances from Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. Michael B. Jordan also gives an incredible performance as one of Marvel's best and most memorable villains yet. The action is great as well as Ryan Cooler's direction. However, despite the CG being great for the most part, it dips in quality quite a bit during the third act."
BLACK PANTHER,2 November 2018,8/10,"It seems a long time since the Civil War, this Marvel Cinematic Instalment goes on to show what was happening in Wakanda before the Infinity War starts.Whether it was overhyped or overcooked I know not: I never follow the hypesters or their drivel. Hype is always Overhype as far I'm concerned.The acting was OK, the script as nonsensical I could desire and satisfied the kid in me; maybe I should've left the subtitles on but that happens all the time nowadays! The cgi cartoonery was perfect, almost believable in its enormous scope. At one point the baddie says Death is preferable to Bondage, but the historical statistics wouldn't support such a view - and besides, every living creature on the planet is born into bondage to life unto death. The only difference with humans the world over is that we can also be slaves to capitalism. I won't dwell on the admiring loyalty shown by the common people in here to noble blood royalty!Overall entertaining, even if it couldn't help being chockful of someone else's social, racial and political opinions."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,,"The high rating and the outrageous box office would be definitely a myth to me, just like the American voters would vote an ego maniac into the White House. Neither my point of view nor the way of my reasoning is on the main stream political correct path. I've contributed a review to imdb several days ago, but obviously it didn't pass the censorship, so here again, I'd try to give a review with more kind words to this film. I have to say it again, this film actually sucks big time, poor script, poor acting, the overly messy background paintings with the poor CGI effect, making this film like a rush job to meet the release date. The scenarios also feel contradictory enough since futuristic tech somehow only belongs to a few, the traditional weaponries, such as spears, axes, knives and fist are still the main fighting tools used. There's only one flying machine and the tribal council and the council members sitting around to have a meeting looked more like what we've often seen in ""Star War"". Why the leading character got to put on the weird WWE mask before facing or dealing with any new situation? Does it mean the mask would give him some super(natural) power? But even this guy put it on, he still looked very deadbeat tired and emotionless. There's no showing of any passion or even enthusiasm from him at all, even the fighting for his dominance at the big Fall in front of his tribe, he still look half-hearted tired without energy; maybe because he didn't wear his mask? I really think he was a miscast.Anyway, you deserve it, this and that."
BLACK PANTHER,26 November 2019,4/10,"Expository dialogue from beginning to end, coincidence to make James Fennimore Cooper blush, an incoherent structure, a laughably small timeframe for the story, really dodgy special effects, incoherent world building, and a pretty decent bad guy make for a bad film overall.Ryan Coogler took the situation the Russos made in Civil War, T'challa being the Black Panther, and added so much unnecessary complexity to the situation. For some reason, he tied being the Black Panther to being King of Wakanda, even though it's obviously not necessary. Throwing in a requirement that T'challa lose his Panther powers for a fight to the death with anyone who wants to challenge him to take the throne made sense in the wake of that decision overall (because of how the second one plays out), but it creates massive structural and logic problems on top of it. Is this really how the country's next leader is decided? Whomever can kill the other in ritualized combat? And, there's a drug that can give you super powers and another that can immediately take them away? It's the kind of stupid you might expect from a comic book movie, but the powers are given and taken so easily and frequently within this individual film as to make the meaning of them smaller than intended.So, T'Challa comes back from Europe after Civil War and has to become king and the Black Panther for real. He fights off a challenge from the fifth tribe in Wakanda who hasn't been seen in hundreds of years and secures his throne. Meanwhile, they've received notice of Klauwe, a South African arms dealer who stole a bunch of their precious metal vibranium from them decades ago and killed a bunch of people in the process, including the father of __, who leads one of the five tribes of Wakanda and leads the military. T'Challa goes to South Korea to intercept Klauwe, fails when the antagonist Killmonger gets him first and kills him in a way that leads to everyone else dying. Killmonger than takes Klauwe's body into Wakanda and immediately and coincidentally finds the one person in the whole country with both the inclination to listen to Killmonger at the sight of Klauwe's body and the authority to back him if he should decide to challenge T'Challa.Killmonger challenges T'Challa to the throne, wins by throwing T'Challa over the waterfall without ensuring that the one guy who could prevent him from keeping the crown is actually dead, and starts an imperialistic program that will see Wakanda forcefully take over other countries because they don't align with his values. T'Challa is, of course, not dead, gets resuscitated and re-powered with the magic plant that gives him Black Panther powers before challenging Killmonger to a second fight which blows the whole country into its own civil war. Oh, and Killmonger had shown up less than twenty-four hours before.This movie is a complete mess. The biggest issue is that the story itself really doesn't start until an hour in when Killmonger shows up in Wakanda. Everything up to that point are subplots that don't really matter. The first half hour deals with world building around a utopia with incomprehensible customs around government and an action scene that doesn't really matter because T'Challa was effectively king before and is king afterwards. Hell, based on Civil War, I assumed that T'Challa was already king because he said so in that movie. Klauwe is an excuse to get an action scene in Seoul. Since Killmonger just shows up with Klauwe's body, the whole action scene didn't actually affect the story in any meaningful way. Once Killmonger gets there, we get a sense of a central conflict, but the conflict of visions isn't built dramatically. It's just people explaining their believes to each other in expository dialogue. Killmonger, while a pretty good villain considering his competition of antagonists in the Marvel Universe, is more of a hodgepodge of motives that never really get straightened out. He's out for revenge and to make Wakanda an imperialistic power imposing its views on the world. Fine, but his motives for his actual actions seem more driven by the mere revenge and the stuff about imperialism is a coating on his motives. It doesn't feel like the motives were ironed out particularly well.In the end, I find this a confusing slog of a film. The final fight gets ridiculous, not because it has war rhinos (which are kinda cool in a superficial way), but because of the short timeframe that the whole story has taken place. This great jewel of the world, hidden away because of its awesomeness, was thrown into complete chaos within a twenty-four hour period and only resolved because one guy got stabbed in the heart. I mean, there's disruptive and then there's a utopia that's never had its power structure challenged in the least way, undermining its status as a utopia. It also looks rather bland. There are bright colors in terms of costumes, but outside of that the movie leans much more heavily towards the visual aesthetic of Captain America than Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok. Things look kind of blandly typical in Wakanda with science that has a visual texture that feels a whole lot like Tony Stark's tech that undermines the idea that Wakanda's science is all that advanced. It could have done better with a bigger embrace of the outlandish, though the waterfalls and costumes do provide some visual flair in an otherwise bland soup."
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2019,6/10,It's the most formidable Marvel film to date; a cinematic artifact that feels like it shouldn't belong to the corporate superhero apparatus. But it's really exciting to know that it does.
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,8/10,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Black lives really matter in this well-made movie, but it is hardly the ground-breaking innovative pop entertainment that one expects after all of the hype.JIM'S REVIEW: The reviews are in for Ryan Coogler's Black Panther and they have been glowing...""A cultural phenomenon""...""A monumental achievement in filmmaking""...So is all of the hoopla justified or is this film simply a well-made example of a crowd-pleasing comic book action hero movie? Obviously, my opinion won't change any moviegoer's viewpoint as the film is on its way to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. But review it I will...Black Panther does follow the formula of most superhero movies: establish its hero and villain, build the conflict between them while laying out the mythology and origins, and creates endless CGI battles. The difference here is its predominantly African-American cast and crew overtly celebrating its own cultural heritage. The film also takes its time to delineate its supporting characters and make them fully-rounded individuals of merit. Kudos to that, and its message of social and political conscience found within its story.The film firmly celebrates racial and gender equity in its depiction of an utopian universe called Wakanda. This isolationist African nation is a technically advanced place with a peace-loving population of various tribes who have no interest in being included with the outside world and its troubles. They purposely make their country's appearance as an impoverished third world country to our real world. But beneath its surface, there is a secret powerful substance called vibranium that protects this Kwanzaa territory and makes their Lion King into a Black Panther who will reign supreme. That is, until evil forces discover this metal for weaponry and corrupt power.Yes, the basic set-up of superhero versus super villain remains intact and much of the film's beginnings are, while compelling, still long exposition posing as a story. Our hero is T' Chaka (a fine Chadwick Boseman) who is in love with a very independent woman named Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o, ever so classy). T'Chalka (a.k.a. Black Panther) becomes king and must stop the outside world from getting their stash of vibranium at all costs. Helping him is Okoye (a terrific Danai Gurira), a fearless female warrior, and her Amazonian army of bodyguards. This film uses women power to the max, another timely positive touch in this MeToo state-of-the-world mindset.Mr. Coogler directs with skill and confidence. His debut film, Fruitvale Station, an under-appreciated crime film, showed a new talent to behold, and his second feature, Creed, established a director with an unique vision. This film, his third, shows a visionary craftsman that stages his action scenes with flair, especially his climactic battle on land and in air. His deft hand elevates this film from standard superhero mode to a film of importance and authority.However, one wishes the screenplay by Joe Robert Cole and the director would have been more adventurous in breaking out of the standard issue formula found in this fantasy genre. It does, at one point, venture out and begins to resemble more of a spy homage to James Bond, complete with fast cars and gadgetry, but then it goes safely back to comic book land and gets lost in its overindulgence of CGI effects, some of which are too noticeably fake.As written, our hero is rather a bland crusader whose supporting army of warriors are far more interesting than the main character himself. The world and characters spinning around him is a more exciting bunch. As with most action flicks, it must be the villains who have the necessary know-how to engage the audience. And in Black Panther, we have, not one, but two evil forces that are great foils. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue is the antithesis of sinister evil as a black market arms dealer and makes a lasting impression, but stealing the film is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, one of the most memorable villains since Heath Ledger's Joker. Mr. Jordan is dynamic as the vengeful rival wanting to seize the throne. He brings a street-wise edginess to the narrative very convincingly and is able to give his complex character a tragic side as well, no easy feat.Rounding out the cast are such talented performers as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, John Kani, and Daniel Kaluuya. Also giving great support are British actors Martin Freeman as a C.I.A. agent (with a perfect American accent too) and Letitia Wright in a breakout performance as T'Challa's savvy sister, Shuri.At the risk of sounding too kumbaya, Black Panther has its flaws, but it is a rollicking good time. It doesn't break any new cinematic frontier as one is led to expect by the critical hosannas, nor does it redefine film history (except for the fact that the film industry has now discovered a black audience's willingness to pay green). But as entertainment goes, the movie repeatedly scores...and that's no easy feat either."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Another Marvelous weekend is here and it holds another Disney branded film to be released into the local theaters. The superhero theme of the weekend strays from the normal leads you've seen in the last few years, one who has more ferocity than the usual crew, maybe outside of the Hulk. Yes, I'm talking about Black Panther, and after much anticipation it is here and ready to unleash the cat within. Does this highly awaited film meet expectations? Robbie K is here to help out, with yet another movie review. Sit back, relax, and read on as I help out with your movie going pleasures. LIKES:The Cinematography: A good hero movie requires good visuals to bring it to life, and Black Panther reigns supreme on this level. After some unique storytelling art at the beginning, the movie resorts to beautiful blends of real-life, breathtaking shots and impressive visuals. The movie drops you into what feels like a technologically advanced city, complete with James Bond like gadgets that feel super in themselves. Black Panther's camerawork is also very dynamic, energetic enough to increase the action, but contained enough to not leaving you nauseous or confused. The Acting: Marvel movies sometimes tank in this section, but again Black Panther raises the bar on this level. Chadwick Boseman retains the regality of T'Challa from Civil War but adds more conflict and growth to the character as he struggles with the mantle of king. Michael B. Jordan comes back with a fire, once again showing that he earns his spot in Hollywood with an emotionally charged performance that seethes with that raw edge. Lupita Nyong'o brings the balance to the movie, portraying a character that acts as a solid bridge between all parties, keeping her dynamic performance balanced at the same time, while Danai Gurira grounds the characters down with her strong will and fantastic stage combat skills. Letitia Wright is the comedy of the film who has a fantastic delivery of the well-written lines this movie has. Almost all parties involved nailed their roles, with the chemistry between everyone favorably mixing to create what felt like a tribe. Fantastic job casting director. The Comedy: Marvel is all about making you laugh, sometimes making that the focus of the film and other times as a nice add-on. Black Panther took the latter for me and was tastefully done to perhaps be one of the best executions of the Marvel Universe. In this darker movie, there is a lot of tension and raw nerves exposed in the Savannah drama, with many negative emotions running rampant like the predators of the plains. Yet, intermixed in this intensity is comedic gold, or vibranium in this case, well-placed to maximize laughs and clever to avoid the usual slapstick staleness that plagues most movies. This style of comedy didn't detract from the movie but added another layer to help reset the tension and keep you engaged in the movie from start to finish. Plus, you've got a nice combination of styles in store as well, so two thumbs up for that. The Emotion in the Story: The movie does not have the most unique story, something hard to accomplish in this age of saturation. Yet this Marvel version of the Lion King is packed with so many moments to send one into an emotional fervor, sending you on a roller coaster ride of feelings. Black Panther will be inspiring to many, bringing approving claps and motivation to change the world. It's a moral filled tale that brings out the dynamic use of technology, the importance of family, and the dilemmas of a new king having to face. While I'm not the biggest supporter of dramas, Black Panther manages to make the drama feel less soap opera like that many movies fail to avoid. The Ending: Many f Marvel's movies often fail to find that satisfying ending to conclude the awesome tale. Black Panther, manages to keep everything going from start to finish and brings all the building tension to full boil with an exciting climax. All the characters are brought into the mix, having some involvement in the conflict at hand, as they fight in impressive choreographed battles. And while our combatants dance in the virtual field, the story continues to progress and the characters develop with each swing of the weapon. It utilizes all the elements that they had developed during the movie, which goes to show story telling is still alive. DISLIKES:Impressionable Hate: More of a warning, the main villain is not only skilled and deadly, but has a surprising amount of hate contained in his chiseled body. Killmonger is a character that has a lot of issues, and his plot to change the world is something that can motivate impressionable minds down the wrong avenue. Be careful when taking friends and younger audience members to the film who have difficulty understanding character flaws. Martin Freeman: The movie did an okay job with the former hobbit, but I expected a lot more from Freeman's character. Though there is some comic relief, and a little action with his character, Freeman really didn't feel that pertinent to the story until near the very end. Such a legendary actor deserved some more relevance to the plot, some extra comedy, or at least some better development to justify the price tag that comes with him. Not the weakest character mind you, but not what I expected. More Action: No surprise, Robbie want's more action in his Marvel movie. With Black Panther, I had worried that most of the excitement was ruined in the trailers, especially with a huge gap between those action-packed sequences. Had it not been for the ending, I would have been disappointed in this quality, but still I wanted more to be unleashed in this movie to put T'Challa's skills to the test. The VERDICT:  Black Panther is by far one of the better Marvel films to grace the theaters and shows promise for the future of the series. The tale has fantastic visuals to bring the world to life, alongside amazing writing and acting to further bring Wakanda to the playing field. It keeps its characters engaged and fills the 2-hour 15-minute run time with an emotional fervor to keep you integrated into every aspect until that incredible ending sequence. However, the movie still has a few limitations including needing a little more action, a dab more of Martin Freeman's relevance, and a slight decrease in predictability to make this a perfect film in the Marvel universe. Still, the film gets massive props for reviving the Marvel movement this year. So definitely get out there and see Black Panther and unleash the beast that dwells within all us comic book fans. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"I went to see this movie with my friend in theaters without either of us knowing anything about the character. The biggest thing that took away from my experience of this movie was some a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to go on their phone during the climax and light up the theater. In case you're reading this review before you watch, I'd like to let you know that there are two end credits scenes. If you like watching them, be sure to wait around until the very end. This movie probably doesn't deserve the high rating I gave it, but I had a lot of fun watching. Cinematography - The CGI in this movie was a bit inconsistent. Some scenes looked really fake while the majority was extremely well done. Most of the fight scenes were done very well, while others looked terrible (there was a fight scene at the beginning taking place in the middle of a forest that looked terrible). Overall, this was a very colorful and aesthetically pleasing film. Characters - The acting was amazing all around, bringing these characters to life. Though most of the characters were intelligent, I did find The Black Panther's dad to be one of the most stupid and infuriating people to ever exist on this planet. Most of the characters had some kind of motivation for doing what they were doing, which just made them even more believable. Plot - The plot was predictable. I i figured out the majority of the events before they even happened. Though I had a lot of fun watching this movie, the plot was pretty cliche and formulaic. There weren't too many character arcs and a movie that had so much potential fell a bit flat. There could've been more conflict and possibly some kind of internal struggle within the main character to make it more interesting, but for some reason they decided not to do that. The Fight Scenes - Save for a few shots of your standard hyper edited Marvel movie fight scene bs, the majority of the fight scenes in this movie are well-choreographed. Despite there being no tension (because all the ""good guys"" are basically invincible) they are pretty fun. However, there is a scene where a woman gets her throat slit onscreen and there is no blood. There are actually a lot of scenes with people getting stabbed and there being no blood. This is a movie that will drop the f-bomb but avoid blood at almost all costs. You can't just pull a spear out of someone's abdomen and had it be shiny and clean THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. The Humor - The movie mostly fails at this. There are a few funny elements to this movie (like the leader of the mountain tribe) but most of the ""humor"" consists of outdated memes. There is actually a scene where a character makes a 4-year-old ""what are those reference"" and everyone in the theater cringed loudly (there were a lot of people in that theater). However, later in the same scene the same character is involved in a pretty funny gag where she kinda pranks The Black Panther by withholding information on his new suit. Like the CGI, the humor in this movie is inconstant in quality. Technology - Unlike other movies with futuristic technology, all of the tech shown in this movie looked convenient and actually useful in some way. Sound Design - The soundtrack for this movie was amazing (in my opinion) and unique. The sound design also helped with bringing to life this futuristic world. I have some hearing difficulties an usually have a lot of trouble understanding speech (at home I usually watch movies with the subtitles turned on) and especially people with accents different from my own, but at no point was I struggling to understand an English-speaking character in this movie. The music and background noise doesn't drown out the characters speaking. Also most everyone in the theater was polite enough to let everyone hear what was going on. I'm just mentioning all this because it was greatly appreciated. I realize that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie like I did, and there are plenty of people who will get bored by the 2 hour+ runtime, but I was throughly invested for the entire duration of the movie. I believe I've explained my reasons. If you don't like Marvel movies, don't see it. If you think that a sci-fi superhero story with incredible new worlds and a fun story sounds interesting, go see it. If you are someone who thinks that this movie is in any way trying to be political, I'd recommend that you go see a psychologist. There is nothing political about this movie. Its a fun dumb superhero movie with black main characters. I don't see why there are people using this movie in discussions about race."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,6/10,"One of the most hyped movies I think has ever been released, 'Black Panther' is definitely something special for Marvel, but to cinema as a whole it is somewhat mixed. Most everything about it is at least competent (except for SOME of the lesser CGI effects), but the final battle is less than compelling or entertaining, sadly drowning out some of the really great things in this film that would make it more worth a rewatching. For most of the film's running time, I genuinely enjoyed it, particularly in its first half. There is some really good humor (although there were a few moments that were rather eye-rolling in their unfunniness), some great action (I thought every action sequence was almost perfectly handled UNTIL the lengthy and frankly boring battle the film climaxes with), some very interesting concepts explored in a very fair and well done way, and an extraordinarily compelling villain whose arc does contain some real sympathy and understanding. Much of the film is a fun, entertaining ride, but towards the end it does unfortunately fall apart and breaks into some pointlessly loud and disorienting scenes of generic action and such. A very good film that could have been groundbreaking if some flaws were fixed. Not as bad as some w/overly high expectations or even an alt-right-esque racial agenda might have you think, not as great as some liberal critics and hyper reactionary twitter users may have you think; instead, it is a bit of a fun improvement of the standard Marvel affair that contains various elements that I feel could have made up a masterpiece but were sadly put slightly down by some of the film's weaker ones."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"In the latest production from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), we see the original story of the Black Panther. We were introduced to the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. This film depicts the story of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the Black Panther tribe. 
 
When T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, beautiful and technologically impressive nation of Wakanda, a fictional country in Africa, he is named the new leader following the death of his father. True to custom, he is challenged by the tribesman and becomes the new King. Elsewhere, a cousin unknown to him returns from the United States to challenge T'Challa's reign, and chaos ensues. Warmonger (Michael B Jordan) and his political beliefs are diabolical and the opposite of T'Challa's. As foes set forth to destroy Wakanda, Black Panther teams up with a C.I.A. agent and a neighboring tribe to prevent the country from a world war. The path from light to dark, and back to doing good in the world beyond Wakanda is refreshing.The film is pure Marvel action-adventure with a broad political and socially aware feeling. It is awake and unique. It may be a superhero film, yet it is also steeped in real political and social issues similar to those we face today, especially diversity and inclusion. The strong female characters - Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are phenomenal. 
 
I love this film! From the casting, cinematography and directing, to the special effects and female empowerment, it is fulfilling. The action is believable, many of the fight scenes are based on African martial arts, although the CGI at times is a little whack. Overall, I was displaced, forgetting I was sitting in a theater. The costumes are fantastic with attention to detail befitting royalty. Wakanda forever!I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for the cast, social and political awareness, technology focus and female empowerment. This film will appeal to ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. I caution younger viewing due to fight scenes which may be disturbing.Reviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Juror."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a stunning first solo outing for its title character that wowed me with its strong ensemble cast, inventive visuals and multi-layered story. Black Panther follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, an advanced and highly powerful territory that is disguised as a third-world country. He also protects his nation and its people as a masked vigilante called the Black Panther. After the death of his father, T'Challa is chosen to take the throne and receive the powers of the panther god. Just after his extravagant coronation, a threat finds its way into Wakanda's borders by Erik Killmonger. Killmonger is a fierce and skilled soldier who wishes to replace T'Challa and usher in a new age for the country. T'Challa will be tested and must protect the throne from Killmonger.My favorite character is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's whizkid sister who helps him maintain the mantle of Black Panther and stay one step ahead of the villains he faces. Letitia Wright delivers hilarious one-liners with near perfect timing. She nails the rapport between Shuri and her brother, interacting in a way that is both believable and develops both their characters.An outstanding performance in this film comes from Michael B. Jordan who is brilliant as Killmonger. He abandons the genre's usual vague ""destroy-the-world"" motivation and creates a genuinely complicated character. Jordan has cutthroat moments that make you dread his presence, but his sinister manner is evened out by moments where you come to sympathize with his character.The deep, emotional part of the film's story is unexpected and caught me by surprise. It is an important moment for the main character and what drives his actions for the rest of the film. Sometimes, these comic-book heroes make poor decisions and have to fight against their own demons as well as the bad guys. This has been done before in both comics and film, but here we really see T'Challa change through his experiences. I recommend this film to ages 12 to 18. There is some action and violence with spears and swords that feels more violent than what I'm used to from comic book films. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Black Panther is easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen. Period.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther was going to be a new and different entry into the Marvel film universe. A superhero and story we have not seen or heard before. The film definitely had its moments and plus points such as great CGI and effects. The fight scenes were a treat to watch and it had a great exotic feel to it. However the story was very predictable and linear in that there were no surprises and nothing too original. The villain, despite a likeable actor, was a weak and uninspired one. The son of traitor who trained in the army and has returned to take the throne. There was a lack of humor and hence the drama felt forced and weak. The soundtrack was quite poor and there no strong supporting actors to help lift the film. Overall a nice entry into the Marvel universe in the build up to the heavily anticipated Infinity war. 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,10/10,"And that's even before more superhero movies are coming out later, including the big one, Avengers Infinity War. My dad is kinda sick of superhero movies save for a few Marvel movies and one DC movies like Wonder Woman, but I wanted him to see this movie before it left the theatres and we came in with low expectations. Boy, we were wrong. This film picks up years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which Black Panther debuted on screen for the first time, as the main character, T'CHalla (Chadwick Boseman), deals with the passing of his dad from an assasination that was shown in Civil War, and is on a quest to become the next king of Wakanda, the world from which he was born into. The only thing standing in his way is the Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who is the main bad guy of the movie. Chaos then ensues before all is settled in the end. Make sure you stay during the credits for two scenes, one in which Black Panther is at a UN meeting promoting world peace and before the movie's over Bucky Barnes as White Wolf, who will play a big role in Infinity War guiding T'CHalla's little sisters' team against Thanos and his army. I suggest you see it in 2d, as this film was converted in 3d just like every other MCU movie. The special effects are ok, the surround sound is amazing, and cinematography is amazing. Not only that, but there's lots of action, suspense, some humor, and as usual, a cameo by Stan Lee, this time in a casino scene reminiscent of a James Bond movie. The director of this movie also worked on Creed, not to mention Fruitvale Station. I can't wait to see what the sequel promises after the events of IW. Wakanda Forever!!!
Update : He survived Endgame after being killed in IW but the fate of the sequel is in limbo after the star died overnight of colon cancer at the age of 43. We will miss you T'Challa."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,6/10,"I know, I know... what was I expecting? A masterpiece of cinema from a story based upon comic books? Well, apparently that is what it is supposed to be judging by all the critical acclaim that it has garnered. However, I found it to be about as formula-driven and predictable as I have come to expect from Marvel movies. In short, it is just more of the same, wrapped up in a nice veneer of ""Oh look! Not very many white people! How groundbreaking!""Not that Black Panther is a bad movie. Far from it. But it is not the be-all and end-all of movie craft that some would have you believe.The acting is fair and there is the ever-present Marvel sense of humour throughout. CGI is decent, though the titular character does have acrobatic moments which gave me PTSD-like flashbacks to Catwoman's unrealistic gymnastics. Overall, though, the movie is solid enough and a pleasing diversion. So what is my issue with it?Well, its just more of the same. It may be Marvel fatigue setting in, but you'd think they'd at least try to do something different with the story. But no... it's the same ""Costume-clad hero who doubts himself takes on cardboard evil villain in a fight to the death and ultimately emerges victorious and with a new appreciation for his place in the scheme of things""At its most basic, this is every Marvel movie, of course, but given the hype surrounding this one, I had hoped for a little more. Apparently my hopes are not to be.SUMMARY: A bit dull, honestly and with an over-reliance on the usual Marvel tropes to carry it through. Diverse cast, but not very diverse script. Formulaic, predictable and just more of the same."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2019,7/10,"It always feels that the story is biased. ZZ tastes too strong, and a protagonist with extraterrestrial biotechnology transformation can be easily laid down by supporting roles. Did I read the martial arts novels of the 1970s? There are secret books under the cliff."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,6/10,"This honestly feels like Marvels version of The Lion King more or less.My biggest complaint is that this movie killed off both Andy Serkis and Michael B Jordan as there characters. My favorite scene is when they are in the casino and they are fighting, the car chase and both battles between Black Panther and who ever was Michael Jordan. Overall it's pretty good movie but it is not as good as Thor Ragnarok."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,7/10,"Sure it's great to see different people on screen and there were a few attempts at addressing real world issues (usually in brief snippets of dialogue spelling it all out for you) but the hyperbole being dripped over this movie is insane. It's a ridiculous kids movie that has the exact same basic plot and action beats as almost all of the other marvel movies. This isn't the second coming here people. It's just a well made popcorn movie that you'll forget about in a few months. Can we please have one of these movies that doesn't involve the hero fighting a guy with the exact same powers as him? The only saving grace here is that there was no giant space laser. This is a well made product designed to sell you things and keep a massive money making franchise going. A lot of people worked to make it palatable and easy to digest, which it was, but it's not some kind of classic of cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,3 February 2019,7/10,"Beautiful people trying to save a paradise. First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, ""throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!"" This character's ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society. So I hope you won't be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros. I believe there is inspiration in seeing people, who look like you, behaving nobly, and, so, I am glad to see a movie with a talented black cast telling super human stories. The acting was good, the CGI was spectacular as were the action scenes. The cast had many superstars, (British Martin Freeman, our token white person, playing a rough, tough CIA operative was remarkably convincing). I enjoyed the action adventure of the movie and the world it created. Beautiful people, beautiful production, adventure, action, inconsistent writing - but, on rewatching, despite the Oscar nod for best picture, I can only give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2019,6/10,They told me to watch this and it isn't good at all. And why there are a lot of positive reviews
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,6/10,"An American action fantasy film; A story about a new ruler of a hidden African nation who faces a challenge for his throne. Assisted by his tribe's forces and a CIA agent, the new King is soon locked in a life-or-death struggle. This is a film with multiple running themes including isolationism vs threat of openness, and what wealthy nations owe to the poor and oppressed.
Few Marvel films work better tonally than this one. The battle sequences which overcrowded some of the other Marvel films have more purpose here. By no means does ""Black Panther"" transcend the action genre but it certainly embraces it in a skilful way. It has a plentiful array of dazzling costumes, inspiring set design, and different cultural elements which are well-observed. The use of CGI provides a beautiful backdrop of a near idyll. Alas, the characters do not stand out from the beauty and sweeping majesty of the stage backcloth. The film is also impeded by the studio's anodyne dialogue which feels like design-by-committee. T'Challa, the King, is played well but the character lacks dimension. Martin Freeman's character is smooth-talking but with a turn of phrase more akin to a freshman than an airman. In contrast, Michael B. Jordan's villain gave the film a spring to its step, while Andy Serkis gave us a character of verve, albeit brief. All in all, it looks fabulous, but its thematic assertions were a little feint."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2021,7/10,"The hype around this film during its initial release was overwhelming, I may not agree with it but it's understandable as Black Panther is the first film in MCU to feature a predominantly black cast. Which is something that's rare and has been underrepresented in the MCU, and cinema in general. I thought the writing and directing were all very good. And also the film is technically an excellent movie. Visually Black Panther is stunning. The cinematography (especially in Wakanda) is incredible. The visual effects used during the fights/action set pieces are excellent ( tho the CGI is dodgy in most parts). I also like the costumes, in particular those of the various Wakandan tribes. The make-up effects also deserve some praise. The soundtrack is very impressive; the rhythm of the drums give that authentic African feel; and the modern music is integrated perfectly to intensify the action. In terms of performances; Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa does a pretty good job. As the new King, he has so much going on around him; Not only must he deal with the external matter of preventing someone from using vibranium as a destructive weapon but he must also face internal challenges for his crown. T'Challa could have sat back and enjoyed his position, maintaining the status quo. Instead however, he felt it a duty to consider what he believed to be the failings of past Wakandan monarchs and do what he believed was right for this generation.
Michael B Jordan as the villain Erik Killmonger is also amazing. The character's motivations, albeit villainous could in a way almost be justified. This is what made him such an interesting character. The rest of the supporting casts are good in their performances.
On the whole, Black Panther is being deem as a perfect film, which I don't agree but I still think it is a well done origin superhero flick. The cast performance is terrific and the technical aspects are all good."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2020,7/10,"'Black Panther' is a popcorn movie nothing more nothing less. Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"After nearly two years since Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther leaps onto the scene and gets his own movie; and what a great surprise this movie was for me.
Marvel's movies have gotten a little derivative for some, and I think Black Panther is something of a multicultural response to that criticism: the movie evokes The Lion King, Skyfall, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Thor and Wonder Woman while creating an identity of its own; the panther is no Batman clone I can assure you of that.Ryan Coogler writes, co-produces and directs the film with surprising ease and boy this man knows how to infuse style into franchised movies; we've got the first blaxploitation superhero movie of the age, and it has A LOT to say about war, entitlement, morality, political (& cultural) unity and feminism. This movie is a broadly appealing triumph of genre filmmaking with culturally distinct aesthetics that are otherwise outside the typical Western mainstream. African-American filmmaking got a tonne of coverage in the 70s, and it looks like that with the likes of Black Panther and Get Out, filmmaking made by, and centered around, black people is making a long overdue comeback into the modern mainstream. With Hollywood stars like Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong'o gracing Black Panther it's amazing that there are directors like Coogler are at long-last getting into the blockbuster scene.I love this film; it's a global semi-political-conspiracy thriller that takes place in Africa, South Korea and the United States and utilises those locations as beautifully as any of the very best James Bond films.Black Panther is a must-see of the highest order, and good job on MARVEL for making all of this possible!"
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2019,2/10,"I did not like Black Panther. I tried to watch it multiple times, and every single time it let me down. It's a terrible film. It's like they purposefully know how to make the movie bad, and then continue with those same elements that people hate. It's like, don't they test run these movies before releasing them? They keep putting the same trash out there again and again.And yet, it's not a total complete disappointment. It has cool scenes with Michael B Jordan. He plays a normal. cool guy in the movie, and you get disappointed that he does not come out the winner in the end. Some of the action parts are really cool. And the effects towards the end are pretty eye-opening. I remember some elephants or rhinos, and they looked wicked cool.All in all, it's not a good movie. I don't think it's worth watching.2 Stars"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"There are some films where you can practically hear the history books writing themselves - though if all history books were as outrageously fun as Black Panther, university campuses would be bursting at the seams. Accompanying 2017's Wonder Woman as a triumphant one-two punch of unprecedented blockbuster representation finding record-breaking box office and critical success, Black Panther's real shock is that... yes, it is exactly as good as you'd hope. A robust, whip-smart, emotional, and superbly entertaining thriller as unafraid to dive headlong into contentiously topical politics as unabashedly indulge in superhero silliness. Some things are worth the wait. And yet, after a dizzyingly gorgeous animated prologue, establishing the MacGuffin mythology of fictional African technology haven Wakanda, we wait even longer, as director Ryan Coogler deviates into a seemingly tangential Prologue 2.0 set in the slums of Oakland, California. It's a disorienting start (but don't worry; it's only moments more before T'Challa spin-kicks someone), but its coy foreshadowing heralds an important lesson: Coogler is an immaculately precise director unaccustomed to wasting a frame of film. No one could accuse Black Panther of being unambitious, with a plot encompassing human trafficking, international arms deals, salient commentaries on tradition vs. modernity, redefining power amidst a global economy, and roughly as many political maneuvers as an entire season of House of Cards (including brazen, poignantly tongue-in-cheek barbs about immigration and colonial history) - as well as, y'know, fight scenes, cool gadgets, and all that other superhero stuff. The seamlessness with which Coogler weaves together each seemingly disparate plot thread and theme is almost mind-boggling - and yet, his film is as much a cohesive entity as it is more than the sum of its parts. Appropriately, for a superhero film whose production was inevitably delayed for decades due to its affiliation with a revolutionary political party, social politics comprise the core and foundation of Black Panther. Here, Coogler pulls no punches, but is never pedantic. We start out in fun but familiar territory, with a first act globetrotting takedown of Wakanda's arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaue (a gleefully scenery-masticating Andy Serkis, arguably Marvel's most downright fun adversary to date), reminiscent of a contemporary 007 romp (complete with T'Challa's own 'Q,' in Letitia Wright's hysterical, impossibly delightful Shuri). But, right when we begin to settle in and munch our popcorn, Coogler yanks the rug out from us, with a second act tonal shift that flips the film on its head, to the point where more than a few audience members will be left questioning the ethics and legitimacy of the hero we've spent the entire first half admiring as infallible. Enter Michael B. Jordan, who not only energizes the film with a furious surge of passion as he shifts from his early performative swagger to magnetic, fiery dogmatism, but shifts the conflict to a 'Malcolm X vs. MLK' critique of Wakanda's isolationist inertia in the face of contemporary racism and post-colonialism. It's a shockingly bold move for the normally sociopolitically safe Marvel, but it pays off, making the brewing climax not only breathtakingly tense, but an impressively nuanced conversation on ethics, empathy, and the real impact of a contemporary revolution. You won't find that in Ant-Man. Nonetheless, Coogler has his priorities straight, and Black Panther balances its political core with a raucously fun comic book ride. Aesthetically, it's a triumph - the FX, art, and costume design are flooring in their imaginative intricacy, incorporating Tony Stark calibre technology into traditional African designs and costuming (force field cloaks?! cool!), lending itself to a pragmatic sci-fi futurism unlike quite anything we've ever seen in the movies before, while the pastel hues of the 'spirit world' are jaw-dropping in their beauty. The fight scenes are thrillingly fun, balletic as they are brutal (and while T'Challa's new suit, and its explosive release of kinetic energy, adds a fun new level to the customary punching, kicking, and clawing, it's in the hands, spear, and wig of Danai Gurira's scene-stealing, steely general Okoye, that the film is at its most fun and thrilling), and Ludwig Gorasson's musical score, layering traditional African chanting and instrumentation into brassy superhero swells, is addictively sumptuous. There are occasional fumbles - Coogler's pace occasionally lags and sputters, with a more meditative second act verging on the lugubrious (and a couple of ""Remember who you aaaaaaaaare"" heart-to-hearts with John Kani's deceased patriarch that can't help but have their gravitas undercut by snickering comparisons to The Lion King). Still, Coogler sinks it home with furious aplomb, steering (just) clear of conventional Marvel third act ennui with a 'kitchen sink' climax so furiously tense and bonkers (two words: WEAPONIZED. RHINOS) that all cinema armrests will be marked with the claw marks of being gripped by a captivated audience. As the titular monarch, Chadwick Boseman delivers a remarkably grounded performance. Steering the film with a regal calm undercut with muscular emotion and crucially accessible doubt, the film revolves around his steady, magnetic presence, as the showier, scene-stealing bits are commanded by the trio of powerful women ensconcing him (the perfection of Wright, Gurira, and the luminous, passionately charismatic Lupita Nyong'o). Martin Freeman's befuddled fed provides 'fish out of water' access to Wakanda with customary dry wit; he's fun without (quite) overstaying. Finally, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Bassett all elevate one-dimensional secondary characters with gravitas and class, while Winston Duke's M'Baku is so ferociously terrifying mitigated by some of the most precise comedic timing seen in years, he damn near strolls off with the film himself. A staggering accomplishment as fun as it is masterfully thoughtful, Black Panther may not quite settle into The Dark Knight territory of genre-transcending masterpiece, but it pounces proudly at its footsteps, this decade's 'thinking audience's blockbuster with a conscience' to beat. Soak in the well-deserved fun, and let the BET's 2010 cartoon theme triumphantly play me out: ""Black Pan-ther! Black Pan-ther!""  -9.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"There is something about the characters created by Marvel Comics (thanks to Stan Lee). Every character has its own struggle to rise to fame and stumble down heavily. But as they say "" A hero must rise from the ashes of Phoenix"" to become more stronger and wiser than before, Black Panther is one such tale that needs to heard.Black Panther is an enigmatic story of a Prince T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) who is on the verge of becoming a King after his father dies in terrorist bombing. T'Challa returns home to take control of the kingdom of Wakhanda, an isolated African nation which has the resource in form of Vibranium that can change the shape of the world. However, T'Challa is challenged by his cousin Erik Killmonger, who was abandoned in his childhood when his father was killed. From the director of marvelous films like Creed and Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler proves that he is one such fine young talented guy who can transform a script into a must-see film. The first half is fast-paced and makes you glued to the screen with high-voltage drama followed by superbly executed car-chasing scene in Tokyo. We are also introduced to new characters like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ulysses Klaw (brilliantly played by Andy Serkis). The movie takes a sweet turn and second half becomes little monotonous with fall of King Of Wakhanda. The length of the film takes a backseat while editing could have been better. The saving grace is marked by a good comeback of Black Panther a.k.a King Of Wakhanda with a strong climax scene. As usual, there is a scene once the movie ends and a final scene after the entire credit rolls out. Visual effects are superb while Cinematography is excellent. Screenplay is very good and should be lauded for keeping us engaged throughout. Ryan Coogler does a good job in defining each character with aplomb. Each actor has done justice their role which makes the movie even better. But I felt, Andy Serkis stood out as Ulysses Klaw. The brilliant actor was mind-blowing in a small role and I wish the makers could have kept his characters alive for some more time.Overall, Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. It turned out to be better than what I was expecting. Excellent 4/5"
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"Movie: Black Panther (UA): Action/Adventure/Sci-fi - English(I have seen the Hindi dubbed version in 3D)Positives:The performances of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan are excellent and top notch.The visual effects of the film are highly impressive, brilliant, and almost everything you would expect. It's undoubtedly with watching in 3D.The action scenes are excellent, especially the final block. The cinematography in many sequences is class apart and enhances the film's impact.The story-screenplay are different for a film of this genre. It contains a lot of positives messages and values which are bound to impress family audiences.There are many crowd-pleasing and clapworthy moments.Black Panther looks a very cool superhero and his suit is very well designed.Negatives:A few darkly lit sequences are a bit disappointing when viewed in 3D.Repeat value: Definitely!Undoubtedly, BLACK PANTHER is a highly impressive superhero film which creates a big difference as a film of this genre and leaves a strong impact which can even make you willing to watch it once again!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,,"Setting aside what it represents for the moment, let's just say that Ryan Coogler's BLACK PANTHER is a good solid superhero movie. Just like WONDER WOMAN last year, that should be first and foremost the most important thing to consider.What sets PANTHER apart from most superhero origin movies is that it is largely content with 'just' being an origin story. Ever since SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE set the template, most first movies in a franchise begin with the background tale in the first half, and then proceed to the title character's first adventure. Save for a brief epilogue (and the now de rigeur Marvel credits sequence bits (two, here)), PANTHER ends with Chadwick Boseman's T'Chala fully earning the right to his moniker. No second act.For the most part, the strategy works. Writer-Director Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole have concocted an original enough tale (based on the works of Jack Kirby and a cameo-ing Stan Lee, of course) to keep this a backstory-only adventure. Even though there is a bit of sci-fi to spark the story (a meteorite with a magic metal substance called vibranium), this plays out almost like a tribal sword and sandal tale full of magic kingdoms (Wakanda) and god-like leaders. And, of course, there are the usual warring factions. Bringing the legend to the present day involves a seemingly unrelated theft of a Wakandan weapon in a British museum. The robbery is carried off by a cheeky villain named Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Coogler fave Michael B. Jordan). Getting the weapon back involves international intrigue which includes the involvement of an American spy Ross (Martin Freeman). Family secrets are revealed, battles fought including double-crosses before all is settled.The spins on the usual origin story work for the most part, although there are some points where the pacing sags, and the story-line gets a bit murky. Placing the ancient Wakanda in the context of the modern world gets a bit awkward at times with some cringe-worthy dialogue and even a character flipping the bird. It's not that some of these intrusions of modernism wouldn't intrude on their world, but, it's sometimes an uneasy mix with all the somber respect for past rituals and a certain reverence to mysticism. The acting is solid with stalwarts like Angela Bassett and Forrest Whitaker on hand to add gravitas. The production design and special effects work are solid with some intriguing twists in keeping with the story's more offbeat themes. The music isn't bad, but, one thing the D.C. films have over the Marvel universe are the scores. It's as Marvel purposely doesn't want the soundtracks to compete with their 'vision'.BLACK PANTHER's success - both critical and commercial - is worth noting. Even more so, because the actual movie earns that respect. And, the sight of the all those warrior kings and, especially, queens is sight to behold on the big screen."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is in fact all that they are talking about, if a few years ago I did not know the Black Panther Hero, when he appears in Civil War surprised me and 2 years later he wins a movie Solo, Black Phanter still continues in the Marvel formula, is a film that has jokes and has that comic tone, but it can still be different from the others, it implements the African culture very well in the film, it has a sensational soundtrack and a beautiful photograph, there are moments that can make a picture of so beautiful they are, and the story is very well told, merit to the great direction of Ryan Coogler who is a very good director and who has not erred, the cast is very good, Chadwick Boseman plays the character very well and can demonstrate expressions Michael B.Jordan is great as Killmonger, he is undoubtedly next to Loki the 2 best MCU videos, and he has the best motivation too, you can understand his motives and have times that you are not even angry with him, Lupita Nyong'o is great, Danai Gurira is one of the most interesting characters in the movie, Letita Wright is fine and the chemistry of her character with her brother T'CHalla is very good, Martin Freeman has a participation bigger than I imagined I liked him in the movie, Daniel Kaluuya is fine but I did not really like his character and his decisions in the film, I found it a bit forced, and the rest of the cast is competent, Andy Serkis is very good in the film as Ullyses Klaue, the action scenes of the film are good, but nothing surprising, there is no scene that will make you remember her after you leave the cinema, the film has a lot of politics involved and the film ends competently, Black Panther is a film, a of the best MCU movies, and possibly the most important film Marvel has ever made. Note 9.0"
BLACK PANTHER,15 November 2018,10/10,"I loved this movie when not having a clue what to expect having never seen any of its comics or read any of the back story. I always thought the panther's Q was fantastic.
To those that have given it hate because there was so much story obviously haven't seen any of the Thor movies with their story as to who should be King in that story. So people just need to accept good things wherever they come from."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2021,5/10,"I am bit amazed but more disappointed. Unlike other marvel movies where science, emotions, details dominate, this one was much longer, faster, and filled with more quantity than anything. Less real and convincing than others and less interesting because it is based on something too much unreal and out of ordinary without any explanation or logic. Too unreal, too long, and somehow looks racially motivated. As if this is more about black people or Africa than about fiction. Bit cool makeup, girls, vehicles, animals, landscape, buildings, devices, superpowers, and stunts. Remind me of famous video games like Need for Speed and GTA and strategies a bit. But story is too unreal, sudden, fast, unfinished, unnatural, complicated, without purpose. No any deep or real emotions but few typical and shallow ones. Although nice insight into human nature such as tribes, instincts, kings, it is what makes it negative. I am just too happy to not live in that city or country or time. Sounds too bare, amateur, negative and based on luck and lack of intelligence. Reminds me of words: nomad, barbaric, homo sapiens, monkeys. Unreal and sudden transition to human world and lack of humans response from normal planet."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,"Movie afternoon with Gertie.And so Marvel finally make an excellent film. Essentially a Hip Hop Lion King.Strong female characters, a complex baddie who actually might just be on the right side. Limited action (which always bores me), but when done spectacular. This is a sweeping African epic.The tragedy is Black Panther will become a minor character in Avengers 6 now"
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2018,8/10,"Based on the Marvel Comic series: the fictional African nation of Wakanda poses as underdeveloped but is, in truth, one of the most developed nations on the planet due to its access to a special substance call vibranium. In current times, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to become king of Wakanda but he must face various challengers. T'Challa, his family, and his loyal friends face animosity from within and outside Wakanda. Some of their enemies believe that Wakanda should share its advanced technology to help other Africans in great need.Like many big-budget blockbusters, ""Black Panther"" is thrilling, exciting, and entertaining. It is also, like those other big-budget blockbusters, occasionally confusing with too many subplots happening simultaneously. But in fairness, it is less confusing than most other such films. What truly makes this film unique in this genre is its Afrocentric focus and perspective with an almost all-black cast. In this way, it has made history and is a welcome breakthrough. Its focus on whether or not Wakanda should remain isolationist also provides an intelligent critique on the current state of the world.""Black Panther"" has something else to its credit: it is a visual splendor and probably the most beautiful film to grace the big screen in many years - yet another reason to recommend this fine film. It truly is a feast for the eyes and is entertaining in so many other ways as well.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Cinematography; Set Design; Costumes"
BLACK PANTHER,8 August 2020,8/10,"Black Panther's introduction in Civil War was perfect, and this one picks up after the events of that movie.The addition of these characters into the MCU has literally brought a whole new world to the franchise. My favorite characters are Okoye (yes, that has a little bit to do with the fact that she plays that samurai in the one tv show) and Shuri (WHAT ARE THOSE!!).JUST GO WATCH IT!!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2018,3/10,"Ho-Hum. Ripped actors that want to tear each other apart.The best part of the film were the female actresses. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett!Otherwise is was a lot of flash, boom, bang. Style but not very much substance story or otherwise."
BLACK PANTHER,11 December 2018,5/10,"Great CGI and decent acting. Beautiful. But the story is a mash up of many bits of wars as old as the greco-roman era, except maybe for the civil war bit. Too much magic powers just isn't making sense at some point. Suits and helmets that appear and disappear? All the rating goes to the beauty. Silly otherwise."
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,6/10,"This is going to be difficult; did I enjoy the film - it was ok without being brilliant. Did I think it was as good as the critics say - not by a long way. Do I think it is worthy of all the awards and plaudits it has received - not entirely. Do I think it's been talked up due to the ethnic diversity contained in the film, particularly the cast - yes (sorry). Is the diversity a good thing - of course it is.Black Panther introduces the Marvel universe to Wakanda, the fictional home of the Wankandan people and their king/leader/superhero saviour - the Black Panther. In a nutshell the movie is this - a new king is born metaphorically), he doubts himself, the crown is threatened, a new quasi king emerges and dethrones the old king, the new king turns out to be bad, conflict ensues to the point of civil war, fights occur everywhere, the old king realises his worth and fights for the crown and his people. By the end of the film everything is ok again, the end.Chadwick Boseman plays a good role as T'Challa, but I felt that Michael B Jordan played a better villain in Killmonger. Boseman does display a wide range of emotions as he learns his worth through the plot, he is solid enough, but it is not really anything new. It is this that was slightly disappointing for me - I was more enthralled when he made his appearance in the Captain America movie. It is refreshing to see a black superhero, but the critics seem to have forgotten that there has been a black superhero before in Wesley Snipes's ""Blade"". With a more diverse script to work from and a character that portrayed a wider range of emotions, Jordan slightly outshone Bosenman for me in this film. Both were let down by the CGI fighting/ballet dancing though.The coolest things about the film were the weapons and tech, the best character was Shuri (Letitia Wright) because she delivered humour as well as action. For the good things that Shuri brought, it also felt like I was watching a scene from a James Bond 007 film, where she was Q, and she was explaining to Bond what a gadget did. Playing the queen, Angela Basset delivers poise and grace, but again drawing on comparisons, she could been portraying a version of M from James Bond 007 films too. The whole tribal council thing felt like it was from a Star Wars film too - a kin to the Jedi council.The plot was average because it has been done before, in fact I'm pretty sure that this wasn't far off the plot of ""The Lion King"". This was the biggest let down for me, not only had it been done before but it was plagued with light, throw-away ideas that weakened it. It didn't feel like a polished Marvel film that I was used to seeing, and it certainly didn't feel as good as the critics had been raving about.
I have an issue when superhero's fight practically identical carbon copies of themselves, for example; the worst part of ""Antman"" was Antman fighting Yellow-jacket as they were practically the same. The worst part of the Iron Man films was when he fought against carbon copies of the Iron Man he had made. I even hated computer games that did that - Ken/Ryu in Street Fighter - SubZero/Scorpion in Mortal Kombat - It is lazy and it's cheap! Black Panther sadly does exactly that. Throw together two black panther suits, identifiable mainly by the varying shades used on the trim - and then the action scene's just look like lazy CGI dancing, something you'd expect to see a college computer design student make. On the topic of CGI, it was in abundance here. Usually Marvel does it in a way that the film looks natural enough, but in this film it was that overused that it felt at times like I was watching a cartoon.I think this movie got the acclaim it did because 99% of the cast were black - for me I don't care what colour, race or religion somebody is - film is about the story, it's about losing yourself to something fun and exciting. There are some seriously great films out there with a black cast, but they do not get the praise they deserve - I'm sure there will be excellent films in the future with black superhero's saving the day too. Unfortunately, this film felt like it had already been done before a hundred times over. For me, it did not live up to the expectation of hype I'd read into. I really wanted a lot more from Black Panther - I just hope that the next instalment has a better and more original story line. I'd love to rate this higher but the best I can give it is 6 out of 10 because it didn't feel original or fresh, it looked good in places, but it didn't have the substance within it to make it a classic for years to come."
BLACK PANTHER,20 August 2018,4/10,"And that pretty much kills the mood of a superhero movie. The ultimate protagonist is just weak, timid, sometimes pathetic, whiny. It's just not a good option for a protagonist.Anyway. The movie is fine. Maybe a bit boring, because the serious scenes are interrupted by typical dumb Marvel formula jokes, only really bad ones, in the voice of the most inexplicable character of the whole MCU, the annoying and absurd sister Shuri (clearly done the way she is for girls to identify with, besides how non-sensical the way she acts is). And made worse by the disgustingly bad CGI, the worst of the MCU, and the worst of the post-mcu era of superhero movies.The good parts are basically all thanks to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and the good secondary characters like Klaw, M'Baku and Okoye. Not enough to save a destroyed Black Panther, done way better in just a few minutes of Civil War."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,8/10,"3/11/18. Finally caught this on the big screen, and it was well worth it! Great cinematography, costumes and screenwriting, or everything that makes this a worthy Marvel franchise member. I really liked how Wakanda women know how to fend for themselves and protect others. They are strong role models for girls, and that's a really good thing to see in a super-hero movie (Wonder Woman is also another one!). I like how this movie celebrates the African culture as worthy of respect for its traditions. Worth catching!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"I was actually quite surprised to see the immense hype surrounding this film. Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few. Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films. Pretty content with this film.7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,8/10,I get it Black Panther is a black superhero but he not the first one ever being brought to the big screen cause Blade already done that in 1998 and in my point of view Black Panther is a standard superhero movies with the best villain since Captain America: Civil War.The movie is high on the energy and action like you would expected from a Marvel movie(Not dissing DC btw) but let's talk about Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan.I'm understand where he's coming from and how it lead him to become the man right now so when he died it actually very touching and I think if the MCU need a main villain specific for the world of Black Panther like Loki to Thor or Red Skull to Cap. Erik Killmonger is the one for sure
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"Although early in 2018, Writer and Director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" is one of the year's best. At least it shall be one of my favorites. ""Black Panther"" transcends the superhero movie genera that thrills and touches our souls. ""Black Panther"" is beautiful to behold with the majestic African landscape and seamlessly generated images of the futuristic culture of Wakanda literally hidden from the rest of the world. The screen astounds in tragic physical battles or the shiny Lexus's racing through the night streets in Korea. Ryan along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole create inspired conversations of the sacrifices of becoming greater, forgiveness of betrayal, forsaking utopian isolationism for the greater good. ""Black Panther"" is the culture phenomenon. ""Black Panther"" tells the timeless tale of the Hero and the defining other. Chadwick Boseman is magnificent as T'Challa, who becomes the legendary Black Panther. T'Challa succeeds his murdered Father T'Chaka, played by John Kani, as King of Wakanda. Strikingly handsome Chadwick embodies grace and elegant swag. He distinguishes the hero in his action, his words, and in the power of his tears. Michael B. Jordan plays mercenary ex-CIA operative Eric Killmonger, who defines T'Challa, the Black Panther. Michael is powerful as the suffering villain Eric. In Ryan's narrative and Michael's soulful being, we can't dismiss Eric as mere villain. He's human, too. Like T'Challa, Eric is both lightness and darkness. We all are. Eric's tremendous rage sources from his unforgiving past. T'Challa realizes Eric horrific betrayal. In T'Challa's ""vision quest"", he confronts his Father. He cries, ""We were wrong!"" T'Challa perhaps is the greater man. His Father's words, ""And it's hard for a good man to be king.""- become his paradox. Eric's suffering robbed him of compassion. Though his noble purpose is equality for all. Even the villain is not all darkness. ""Black Panther"" is eloquent resolution of the ideologies of T'Challa and Eric, each valuing courage and dignity in their own ways. Chadwick and Michael's conflict profoundly move us. T'Challa's tears touched my soul. In the ""Black Panther"" mythology, Wakanda emerged when a meteor of made of Vibranium, the hardest metal known, crashes in Africa. Vibranium allowed the people of Wakanda to develop breakthrough technology, becoming the most advanced culture on Earth. Unbeknownst to everyone else. Wakanda is composed of five united tribes lead by the mythical Black Panther. The Black Panther is from the lineage of Kings, who with the serum of the indigenous plant possess great strength, speed, and agility. T'Challa is the next Black Panther. His mother is nurturing Ramonda, played by strong Angela Bassett, who believes he shall be the great King. His sister is genius scientist Shuri, whimsically brilliant Letita Wright. Letita is the scene stealing star. Shuri is like T'Challa's ""Q"" creating the kinetic energy suit he wears among other weaponry. His ex-lover Nakia, played by strong beautiful Lupita Nyongo, is the spy gathering intelligence on the outside world. Amazing Danai Guria plays General Okoye, the powerful warrior guarding the Royal Family. Arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, played by ruthless Andy Serkis, steals Vibranium threatening the revelation of Wakanda and its secrets. Eric is Klaue's mission leader. Klaue seemingly reveals the singluar narrative frailty. He is without nuance almost caricature. He serves as the plot device tying in charismatic Eric. ""Black Panther"" mesmerizes in stunning vibrant visual displays and the inspired battles of T'Challa and Eric. Ryan's words and story resonate. Nakia tells T'Challa, ""Only you can decide what kind of king you want to be."" What kind of person will you be? Who will you become? That inspired to make me to look within as well.That's what is so special about ""Black Panther"". ""Black Panther"" dares you to choose the greater than path, becoming greater than you know yourself to be. To create and live in that greater space. And the world will be greater for it."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,9/10,"Anymore, superhero films are a dime a dozen. I get that they're adding up to a greater narrative for Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but a lot of them seem almost indistinguishable from each other. Enter Black Panther (2018). Not only is this superhero not white, but almost all the action takes place somewhere other than New York City. There are a lot of strengths in Black Panther that make it feel like a cut above the rest. From the set design and aesthetic of Wakanda to the well-developed characters (including women warriors and women scientists), Black Panther shows how a superhero movie should be made.Despite its strengths, there are still a few, minor weaknesses in this film. First, some of the CGI felt a little off in the sense that my mind rejected it when I saw it. These moments were usually pretty rare but were unquestionably obvious. Secondly, one of the tenets of the superhero genre is the action/fight sequences. While these sequences were present and exciting in Black Panther, often they seemed to be jittery and confusing to watch. Perhaps films like John Wick (2014) have spoiled me to the steady camera of a well-choreographed action sequence.One of the best performances in Black Panther, which is why I think it should come so highly recommended, was that of Michael B. Jordan's antagonist, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. The strength of the African accouterments in this film was a cultural foundation that was offset by the oppression of African-Americans. This was made all the more evident by the antagonist's somewhat noble goal. I don't know if I've seen a more sympathetic villain, and it just made the conclusion feel like a richer sense of justice instead of just vanquishing an evil foe.A breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre of superhero films, I give Black Panther 4.5 stars out of 5."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,9/10,"Well, it's not surprising that Avengers: Infinity War is going to become one of the biggest box office successes in cinema history. This film has been out for less than a week and already pretty much everyone who goes to the cinema has seen it, except for me. I haven't seen it yet because I don't get the urge to do what everyone else is doing. So, I'll probably wait until I can borrow it from some library. I actually like the films that Marvel makes, but I don't jump up and down every time one of those films is released. My favorite MCU films are Thor (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Doctor Strange (2016), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pretty much all the Marvel films are enjoyable, but the ones that I've listed are my favorites. The recently released Black Panther isn't one of my favorites. It's not a bad film by any means. It's good. It's more serious that the usual Marvel flick. It's just that only a few characters in the film appeal to me. The film also doesn't quite have the emotional weight that it should have. When it comes to the characters, it lacks the appeal of Thor or of Iron Man, for example. Since Marvel films contain some Anglo-American propaganda, it can also be interesting to see them because of what they're about. Some of the information in these films actually surprised me. For example, in Captain America: The First Avenger, the fictional terrorist organization Hydra uses some odd weapons and technology. Steve Rogers (Captain America) doesn't fight against regular German troops in the film but against Hydra troops armed with extraordinary weapons. Such weapons are usually the stuff of science-fiction, but I later learned that the Nazis did actually have some of those extraordinary weapons. Some of this technology and weaponry wasn't intended for mass production and some of it wasn't fully developed when Nazi Germany was defeated. So, for example, the Germans did have plans to create the Amerikabomber, which was a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the USA from Germany. In the film, the Red Skull attempts to use a similar bomber to strike the USA. At one time, Adolf Hitler considered the creation a giant tank not so different from the one that the Red Skull uses in the film. So, if the Germans hadn't been defeated in World War II, such ""miracle weapons"" would have become a reality already in the 1940s or the 1950s. In the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we find out that some members of Hydra were recruited by the American espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D after World War II. Something similar happened in real life too because the Americans did bring German and other European scientists, psychiatrists, and agents to the United States after World War II. Some of these people, like Ukrainian nationalists, were so-called war criminals because they were engaged in mass killings in Europe.When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I can recommend Paul Kennedy's book 'The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers' (1987). It's a history book with some good information that was recommended by the historian Andrei Fursov. I finally finished listening to The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky a few months ago. It's a thick book, and I had to listen to it for about 25 hours. I'm now listening to the Complete Stories of Sherlock Holmes (in 3 volumes) by Arthur Conan Doyle. The narration is by Charlton Griffin, and I've got to say that I'm really enjoying listening to these releases. It's not only that the narration is very good, it's that I haven't yet read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Therefore, this is something that's new for me. Since Doyle was a Mason and a member of the British establishment, his novels contain some interesting information about British intentions in the second half of the 19th century. Another book that I'm almost finished listening to is Dispatches by Michael Herr. Dispatches was one of the first pieces of American literature that portrayed the experiences of soldiers in the Vietnam War for American readers. Herr's book is surprisingly funny at times, though he mostly describes the behavior of American soldiers and their actions. Carl Sagan's The Dragons Of Eden, which is another book that Fursov recommended, is an interesting read. I got The Dragons Of Eden right after I've read Sagan's well-known 1985 novel Contact, which is one of the more memorable hard science fiction novels that I've read. I personally prefer to read books on my tablet, by using the app Play Books. Other times, when I feel like it, I buy books at second hand book stores. But, for the most part, I read books on Play Books or I listen to them on the Audible app.Some of the novels that I've already read are Inherit The Stars (1977), which is a personal favorite, Blood Music (1985), The Visitors (1980), The Robots Of Dawn (1983), Titan (1979), Beyond The Blue Event Horizon (1977), Mission Of Gravity (1954), The Godwhale (1974), Triton (1976), In The Ocean Of Night (1977), Ender's Game (1985), and Dune (1965). When it comes to Dune by Frank Herbert, I'd recommend getting the unabridged audiobook narrated by Scott Brick and Orlagh Cassidy, among others. I'm not at all a fan of Frank Herbert's work, and his science fiction novels aren't among my favorites, but the audiobook is a compelling listen that includes music and sound effects. Although I'm still reading the manga Berserk by Kentaro Miura (I'm now reading the 16th volume), I've finished reading Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro a few months ago. I've already read famous manga like Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Maison Ikkoku, Akira, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, and Fullmetal Alchemist, but Battle Angel Alita is hard to get because it has been out of print for years. Therefore, you can read it only on the internet or on an app for now. I've thought about reading it for several years, way before I knew that there was talk of adapting it into a film. Sure, the artwork is the biggest draw, but there's also a pretty good story that includes the theme of social control. Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is the continuation of the story that features more of Kishiro's fantastic artwork."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest. In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther. In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium. When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes. Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2020,8/10,"The 'Black Panther' was created by writer and editor Stan Lee and writer and illustrator Jack Kirby, appearing for the first time in Fantastic Four # 52 (July 1966) in the Silver Age of comics, being the first super- hero of African descent created by a mainstream American comic book publisher. This Marvel adaptation brings up the ancient origins of the Black Panthers, a cloak that is passed down from father to son and that traditionally stands in the line of succession between aspirants to the throne of the evolved - but not in the eyes of the world - kingdom of Wakanda.After several speculations for decades about bringing the character to life in theaters, 'Black Panther' premieres satisfying everyone who has longed since the hero's first appearance in 'Civil War', which showed the hero in action after the attack that killed the his father, King T'Chaka, of the fictional kingdom of Wakanda, again bringing Chadwick Boseman as the character. For this adaptation, director Ryan Coogler, who also contributed to the script alongside Joe Robert Cole, manages to bring a mixture of mysticism, legends and African customs that portray this new world, isolated from the world and that keeps many secrets. If the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was daring to change the way a hero film relates to the public, adding the comedy to the genre, Ryan Coogler's feature has the audacity to review the parameters of this thematic foundation, inserting comedy in a few moments and prioritizing a more dense history, which deals with family disagreements, tribal conflicts and revenge.
'Black Panther' accompanies T'Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated and technologically advanced African nation to succeed the throne and to take his rightful place as king. But with the reappearance of an old and powerful enemy, T'Challa's value as king - and as Black Panther - is tested when he is led into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda, and the whole world, at risk. Faced with betrayal and danger, the young king must gather his allies and unleash all the power of the Black Panther to defeat his enemies and ensure the safety of his people and their way of life.The film received seven Oscar 2019 nominations, including Best Picture, with victories for Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design with total merit. Technically, the film is a visual spectacle. The production designer of Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart manages to portray a Wakanda in a fully satisfactory way, knowing how to preserve the most primitive aspect, maintaining the tribal concept of ancient African peoples with the high technology that came from the vibranium, which has shaped all that society since the beginning .Throughout the projection, we are introduced to highly developed technologies capable of healing gunshot wounds in a short time, capable of developing costumes, vehicles with magnetic levitation, sonic stabilizers, surveillance equipment, ultramodern ships, buildings and futuristic architecture. Even the choice of Seoul, South Korea, as another scenario in history, maintains the same futuristic and technological identity as Wakanda. All this technology is very interesting in a more palpable and credible scenario than previously portrayed, especially in the cosmic characters in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor'. It is a mixture of tribal society with extremely advanced technology that enchants the eyes of the audience.
The costume by Ruth E. Carter portrays very rudimentary African tribal clothing very well, bringing the difference in culture between the different tribes that make up Wakanda. The colorful and creative costumes manage to convey this concept of something more primitive and that contrasts so well with the technology of that nation. And this whole nation-building was incredibly orchestrated by Swede Ludwig G√∂ransson, who knows how to thrill when necessary, increase tension at key points and showcase the culture of the people of Wakanda using drums, percussion instruments and tribal chants wisely. The costume, as well as all the construction of the language, habits and traditions of the Wakandians. It looks like a little bit of everything we've seen from African tribes, but at the same time it sounds new, with a certain freshness.
It is impossible to talk about this feature without mentioning the co-protagonists of the film - to call them supporting actors would be to reduce their importance in the plot. The king's personal guard, the Dora Milaje, commanded by Okoye (Danai Gurira), stands out, as does the entire female cast. Shuri (Letitia Wright) - sister of T'Challa - shows how much a Jarvis is out there on another continent and how much a Tony Stark can learn from his technological genius. Pantera's younger sister is equally important in comics - and has even taken on the official role of Black Panther in magazines - and here she is a true teenage genius. Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) is the most efficient and dangerous spy in Wakanda. We also have the power of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), predecessor of the Black Panther's courage, as well as a veteran priestess.
Villains have important roles. Ulysses Klaue, the Sonic Claw (Andy Serkis) - who had first appeared in 'Age of Ultron' - gains importance as a madly believable villain. Even a little cartoonish, his attitudes are anarchic and organized at the same time and his pretext calls into question the goodness of the Wakanda throne. Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is a brilliant strategist and scientist who earned his PHD at MIT. He is also a skilled martial arts fighter, able to take on the best warriors in Wakanda, including the Black Panther in a fight that causes great twists and turns. Their motivations are completely credible. We also have with W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) - who, if at a moment passionately cheers for the king, rebels unexpectedly motivated by the failure to capture Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) by the Black Panther.
One of the points that were missing a little in the story, is a greater amount to the action scenes. We have great scenes filmed in Seoul, with a practically uncut sequence of fights in a clandestine casino and, of course, the chase scenes through the city streets. The scenes of fighting for the throne and the clashes of the last fifteen minutes are excellent and exciting. Visual effects play a fundamental role in creating Wakanda's look, however, in some scenes the not-so-effective use of effects is noticeable.'Black Panther' is a cultural manifesto, unafraid to talk about racial and sexist issues in the US, past and present, while making an exciting and universal superhero blockbuster with a director and a mostly black cast , with themes of the black people and with several women as key pieces of history. A film that shows a closed society, but that from its new king, sees the need to build bridges with other nations, and not barriers, and that there is more that unites people than separates them. A politicized film, which has a more serious tone and uses humor punctually. Ryan Coogler manages to develop the characters and their interpersonal relationships and is competent in the action scenes. He uses and explores well the relationship between the real and the fantastic is not only in the mention of these real problems, but in the visual construction of the feature. In the end, there are still two post-credit scenes. The first gives clues as to what a 'Black Panther' sequence might look like and the second connects with the events of 'Captain America: Civil War."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther continues with the story of T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), after the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). After a family tragedy, T'Challa ascends to the throne & becomes king of Wakanda. Black Panther is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe delivers another flawless masterpiece. Director Ryan Coogler, brings his own unique directing style to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That makes this movie more unique, than the previous films set in this universe. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. Kudos to production designer Hannah Beachler, for making Wakanda look absolutely gorgeous & otherworldly. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Boseman effectively portrays T'Challa's various emotions & inner conflicts. Michael B. Jordan is spectacular as Erik Killmonger. Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding as Nakia. Danai Gurira is excellent as Okoye. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett K. Ross. Daniel Kaluuya is excellent as W'Kabi. Letitia Wright is amazing as Shuri. Winston Duke is great as M'Baku. Sterling K. Brown is unforgettable as N'Jobu. Angela Bassett is impressive as Ramonda. Forest Whitaker is good as Zuri. Andy Serkis gives the performance of a lifetime, as Ulysses Klaue. The supporting cast do their jobs well. Black Panther is a must watch. Watch an absolutely different & refreshing film, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"THE BLACK PANTHER is the first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that relies - predominantly - on characters (and actors) of color to carry it. Of the main characters, only 2 are Caucasian, the rest of the cast (including almost all of the supporting cast and the extras) - AND the Director are people of color. This has, rightfully so, created a ""buzz"" about the significance of this. It is a watershed moment for SuperHero films (much like last year's WONDER WOMAN was a watershed for a female led SuperHero film). But the question remains - is it a good film?The answer: Good Enough.Diving deeper into the character/hero T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) who was first introduced in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film, we learn more about the backstory of this man/character as well as the world in which he lives and the burdens he bears. It also, interestingly enough, pretty much ignores the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for much of it's 2 hour 14 minute timeline. It mostly concerns itself with interior issues in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda and I think this tactic is a welcome relief from the giant, CGI-laden, characters-heavy Marvel films of recent memory.Director/Writer Ryan Coogler (CREED/FRUITVALE STATION) decides to focus the attention of this film inward, rather than outward and we are rewarded with a rich, Shakespearean family drama that works because of it's simplicity.Much of the effectiveness is due to the charismatic cast that has been drawn to this picture because of the significance of it as well as the richness of the characters they inhabit. Bozeman is regal and strong in the title role - no hint of the suffering, ""I don't want this"" SuperHero angst so often seen in these types of film. Academy Award winner Lupito Nyong'o joins in just as strong and independently as Nakia a ""Spy"" and erstwhile romantic foil for T'Challa - though Coogler is wise to avoid the ""will they/won't they"" cliche as well as eliminates, entirely, the ""damsel in distress"" subplot that would have been so tempting.Helping these two out are a veritable ""who's who"" of actors of color - Angela Bassett, Forrest Whitaker, current Best Actor nominee Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown - all turn out for fun (albeit brief) turns where each one of them gets a chance to show what they can do. Special notice should be made to Danai Gurira (TV's kick-ass Michonne in THE WALKING DEAD) as Okoye - T'Challa's chief general and bodyguard who must choose duty over honor (or does she) and, especially, Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger, wise-cracking sister - who also happens to be the ""Q"" of this film. She jumped off the screen and shone brightly (but not so bright as to wash things out) in every scene she was in.And...of course...there is Coogler favorite Michael B. Jordan (he's been in all of Coogler's major motion picture) as the villain of the piece - Erik Killmonger (the name says it all). Jordan does a nice job of bringing 3 dimensions to a character that was written a little too 2 dimension-ally, if you ask me. This character could have just been an ""angry young man"" cliche, but with Jordan, he becomes something much, much more.This being a Marvel SuperHero film, the Special Effects are terrific, showing a highly secretive, highly technolized Wakanda that is hidden beneath the surface.Is it a perfect film? Well...no. This is, in essence, a ""family drama"" with some hi-tech action scenes and the obligatory ""two armies fighting"" finale, and while the acting is good enough to hold interest throughout, I would have liked to have seen a little more action thrown in.But...ignoring the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a good move - as was casting such strong, believable and likeable film actors.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
BLACK PANTHER,12 September 2018,8/10,"Black Panther: 8 out of 10: Marvel Universes first African superhero (Chadwick Boseman) gets his first solo outing after an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (AKA the good Avenger's sequel) where he takes over his hidden African kingdom of Wakanda after the death of his father in a terrorist attack. As the king, he faces questions on whether to open his country to the wider world as well as threats from a usurper (Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan) who threatens to take the throne. The Good. There are some great performances in Black Panther. Angela Bassett brings gratis as the Queen mother (And does not look either her own nor the character's age); Winston Duke shines as M'Baku the leader of the Jabari tribe; Letitia Wright is funny and brilliant as the Black Panther's sister Shuri and seriously needs her own movie; and last but certainly not least is the best Marvel villain since Loki (and one that gives Heath Ledger's Joker a run for his money) Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. I cannot emphasize how much fun and joy the four actors above bring to the screen. Heck, I am recommending the film based on Wright's and Serkis' characters alone. They honestly save the movie.Another thing that saves the movie is excellent costume design and a real sense that they took care to absorb real African cultures into their fictional world. This is an African utopia with a glorious sense of place. The music and costumes combine to help recreate a magical kingdom that still seems somewhat grounded.The Bad: There is a moment in the film (or two) where there is an opportunity to have Winston Duke, as the leader of the Jabari tribe, usurp the crown and take the Black Panther mantle. The movie would have been wise to take this opportunity. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is dull and incompetent. Lady Jane Grey had a longer and more effective rule than this dope. Winston Duke has charisma and presence something one would hope for in a Marvel superhero. (As bad as the first two Thor movies could be they at least always got Thor right.)The antagonist Killmonger isn't that much better. He is overshadowed by Andy Serkis' bad guy, he rants like Buggin Out from Do the Right Thing and he is as an Angry Black Man trope that mostly died out in the seventies. His main beef is that Wakanda didn't use its wealth and technology to help the African diaspora particularly as it refers to the Transatlantic slave trade. In other words, he is upset they didn't invade Mali in the 15th century. Black Panther really missed an opportunity here. Wakanda is a Utopia. All Utopia's have a hidden dark side (See Dubai). Why not have a hidden underclass that Killmonger tries to save. The Mali Empire (1230 to 1670) is basically Wakanda in real life. I mean it is, after all, an absolute Monarchy with mines. It doesn't take a genius to write in an underclass for Killmonger to identify with. It would have also given the Black Panther character some depth and a reason to disagree with his traditionalist mother.The Ugly: Someone at Disney shorted these poor folks on their FX budget. It is clear that they got the B-team. You would think with all the money Disney was saving remaking both the Lion King and a superhero movie in the same film they could have spared a few bucks.In Conclusion: Remember how underwhelming the third act was in the Original Iron Man. Remember how we ignored that because the film was so good. Black Panther is the now the eighteenth Marvel movie yet are we still treated to the same lame showdown and battle in a field. While it is no Blade, Black Panther is a treat of music and costumes and some breakout performances. Come for the Panther but stay for the Serkis."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2021,3/10,"It's funny: When the flick was over, I racked my brain trying to figure out what I had witnessed. In the end, I formulated an essential question: Did I fail this flick, or did the flick fail me.After some time to reflect on the nature of the production and directorial decisions, I think I can say with some assuredness that the flick failed me.Black Panther is operatic, played out in a big budget Hollywood flick.This means that a fairly simple mythology--and scenarios which play out modestly reticulated developments stemming from that mythology--are stretched out over a skein work of standard-issue over-the-top action sequences.So, in the end, I think I ""got"" this flick. It's just that I'm 1) not an opera buff, and 2) tend to not be impressed by CGI and interminable over-the-top action.While I can see ways that direction/production may have thought they were ""throwing a bone"" to snobs like me (e.g., cleverly down-to-earth writing style), it wasn't enough to redeem the exercise.It also niggles because of the way real artfulness in filmmaking has been taking it on the chin lately. The idea that films like Black Panther represent the kinds of money-making stuff that sop up all that money... just rankles."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,8/10,"So to Kick Of 2018 Movie season Watched Black Panther Starring Chadwick Boseman(Captain America:Civil War) as T'challa/Black Panther , Oscar Winner Lupita Nyong'o(Star Wars:The Last Jedi) as Nakia, Danai Guirira(The Walking Dead ) as Okoye, Martin Freeman(The Hobbit.Sherlock) as Everett Ross , Daniel Kaluuya (Sicario) as W'Kabi , Letitia Wright(Doctor Who) as Shuri, Winston Duke (Person Of Interest) as M'Baku ,Angela Bassett(London Has Fallen)as Ramonda ,Oscar Winner Forest Whittaker(Rogue One: A Star Wars A Story) as Zuri, Andy Serkis(War For The Planet Of The Apes) as Ulysses Klaue and Michael B.Jordan(Chronicle) as Erik Killmonger .The film was awesome also really enjoyed the character of T'challa and his growth as a character from what we saw him in Civil War previously also great supporting characters from Nakia,Okoye and Shuri who helped mold T'challa as a character not to mention Erik Killmonger was one the best villains since General Zod from Man Of Steel also the world building was excellent also the story did stuff better that Thor Movies have done a definitely picking this up on Blu-Ray when it comes out .Amazing Direction from Ryan Coogler (Creed) costume design from Ruth E.Carter(Serenity),Production Design By Hannah Beachler(Moonlight),Amazing Score from Ludwig Goransson(Central Intelligence) 8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2021,8/10,"I liked most of the Marvel superhero movies and despite all the publicity, I hadn't the chance to watch this movie up until January 2020. And when it was finally over I thought ''Well, it has his moments and it's generally good''. Then I looked on IMDB and I noticed many reviews with 1s and 2s from probably people who hated seeing a superhero movie with an all black cast or about an obscure African culture (though a bit fictionalized) or perhaps people who wanted to lower its score down. but also lots of positive reviews. And this will be one of them.The movie is about the protector of the Wakanda, prince T'Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman) who is also the most important black superhero, the Black Panther (named this way because of the suit he wears). In the beginning there is the reunion scene with lots of great shots of the African canyons and the scene when he is confirmed Prince of the Wakanda after a fight with a pretendent. Soon his life is in jeopardy as there is an object full of vibranium stolen in a museum and the robber is then killed. The body is taken to the Wakanda by Killmonger, a young mercenary that wants to defeat T'Challa and initially succedds. After T'Challa is found comatose is woken up by his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and manages a rebellion to defeat his enemies.As I said in the summary this is a very revolutionary superhero movie as it's about the first important black superhero (as STEEL and SPAWN were bombs at the box office back in the 1990s despite there was the BLADE trilogy with Wesley Snipes) and it also deals with the thieft of precious substances such as vibranium.The cast is top-notch. Chadwick Boseman (who passed away tragically last August at the age of only 43) gives a great performance as the title hero, and the fact that during filming he was battling cancer just shows us how much a great actor he was. Michael B. Jordan gives a great and solid performance as Killmonger, as he actually plays a likeable villain. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis have lots of chemistry in their few scenes together. Winston Duke, Lupita Nyongo, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker are the most known names of all the other black actors in the cast.I re-watched this movie the day after Chadwick Boseman tragically died and I think I appreciated it even more. However this is one of those superhero movies that fans of the genre will no doubtly love and in hindsight it's just like most of the first chapters of the Marvel movies (the first IRON MAN, the first THOR and the others)."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"""Black Panther"" (PG-13, 2:14), debuting in the second month of 2018, is the 18th feature film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is the first MCU film featuring a predominantly black cast. It's focused on the titular comic book character who was introduced briefly in 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War"". Building on that set-up, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over for his deceased father as King of the fictional Wakanda and, with the title, inherits the abilities and responsibilities of the Black Panther.It appears that the most technologically advanced country on earth is not the U.S. or any country in Asia, but is that nation in central Africa which has been able to develop incredible technology from a rare metal which is found nowhere else on the planet (which also helps the country to remain hidden from the rest of the world, which assumes Wakanda to be just another Third World nation in Africa). In the midst of their high degree of development, the people maintain their ancient culture and traditions which, in this film, represent a rich array of real-world influences from peoples across the continent. Now that he is the king, T'Challa is responsible for safe-guarding Wakanda's unique capabilities from falling into the hands of evil doers from the outside world. (You know what they say, with great technology comes great responsibility... or something like that.) To do his job, T'Challa sometimes must become the Black Panther and use an impressive array of gadgets developed by his sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), who is best described as MCU's Tony Stark meets James Bond's ""M"". Backing up T'Challa is a formidable army led by female warriors like Okoye (Dania Gurira) and loyal officials like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), a spiritual leader called Zuri (Forest Whitaker) and T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). T'Challa is going to need help from all of them (as well as from neighboring tribes and even a CIA officer, played by Martin Freeman) if he's going to stand against the likes of the evil Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and the lethal and power-hungry Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).""Black Panther"" is unique and terrifically entertaining. It fits nicely into the MCU canon, but still charts a course all its own. Its hero is every bit as able and impressive as any other MCU character. As in the plot of most superhero movies, lives are in danger and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, but in a new and creative way. The stakes may be the same, but the tone is different - because of the film's Africa-centric setting - but also in the issues raised and the questions asked. Enhancing it all, we get exciting action, terrific visuals and awe-inspiring cinematography, not to mention a fantastic cast which includes several Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. This a Marvel movie through-and-through (complete with Stan Lee cameo and cross-pollinating end-credits scene), but it's one of the most fully-realized and enjoyable MCU cinematic achievements to date.

BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,6/10,"Finally got around to seeing Black Panther which has been out for a few weeks now. Tried to see it during the opening week, but my regular cinema was the busiest I've ever seen it in the 15 years since it opened. There was no surprise we didn't get in and sure many people suffered similar experience. There is no doubt that the almost entirely black cast and hype certainly packed the the people in. Well done to the guys who marketed the movie.Black Panther tells the story of the secret African society the Wakanda which is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. T Challa (the Black Panther) is the heir to the throne and the film focuses on the challenges he faces. The plot is a bit clunky at times, but the film is always watchable. The acting is good and the visuals are particularly good. Sure we'll be seeing plenty more of the Black Panther in future years and looking forward to seeing more."
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,9/10,"I don't know if it's a game changer but it's amazing! There's no shortage of creativity as it's a 100% here. The story, action and characters are well developed. The only criticism I have is that the movie seems short and some of the effect aren't good.T'Challa(Chadwick Boseman) becomes the new king of Wakanda after the death of his father. While struggling to be the next ruler and maintain the secrecy of his country he's helped by his tech savvy sister Shuri(Letitia Wright), former flame Nakia(Lupita Nyong'o), and bodyguard(Danai Gurira). If that's not enough a distant relative known as 'Kilmonger'(Michael B. Jordan) comes and also wants access to the throne in order to wage war on neighboring countries.It's up to T'Challa and his allies to take on the mantle of Black Panther and put a stop to him once and for all. This's Marvel's first all black cast and it didn't disappoint. The characters are awesome to watch. They have well defined personalities and great chemistry. The villain has an understandable motive and while you don't agree with his methods you still sympathize with him.The action scenes though short are still cool like in the scene where they fight in a South Korean casino. Its awesome! It's amazing to see how the suit works under combat. The effects are cool though some of them stand out like a sore thumb like in the final fight scene. Most of the CGI is cool while the rest isn't.It's amazing how much hype this movie created and whether it delivered is debatable or not but I think what we got was a great movie. Don't take my word it's best if you see it for yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,27 October 2018,9/10,"In the present day, an ancient civilization who discovered the most advanced material and used it to become highly advanced, stays hidden from the world together with its tech. After the death of his father, T'Challa is to be named king but soon he'll find out that a well-hidden secret from the past will force its way into the present to make his job much harder than imagined.It's one of those movies which has a great idea, that of an advanced civilization living hidden in the present world, and builds its story based on it. Speaking of the story, it's quite good from most points of view, managing to avoid linearity and bring something out of the obvious every now and then. It has its flaws though, I must admit, especially when it comes to the finale which could have been treated better, but it is good enough to keep the action together. The characters portrayed are well thought, a bit underdeveloped unfortunately, but still likeable and worthy of the story.The movie is based on action, so you can expect plenty of it, regardless of time. It is by far the most important part of the film, all the amazing fighting scenes, whether speaking of 1v1 or large scale, contribute decisively to the outcome of the film, especially entertaining-wise. You also get a bit of drama from time to time and some emotion, but the action remains dominant.To help build this amazing world, the producers used a couple of very impressive visual effects. It's easy to see that they've put quite a lot of effort into this department, making sure that everything looks as good as it can be. You simply have to give them credit for this one. Another aspect which is worth mentioning is the soundtrack, very well made according to the atmosphere of the movie, adding more suspense each time it comes into play.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a good story, good characters, great atmosphere with great music and some amazing special effects. If the story had received a bit more polish and the characters would have been a bit more complex, we would have been talking about a truly great film. Not that it isn't great as it is, but you're left with the feeling that it could have been made a bit better."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,7/10,"There was a joke on the internet the other day that made me laugh and laugh. Virtually the only white people in ""Black Panther"" are the Hobbit/LOTR stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis.... they are the Tolkein white guys! It's actually getting to feel quite isolating as an 'average white guy' at the movies! After a plethora of #SheDo films about empowered women, now comes the first black-centred Marvel film... stuffed full of powerful women too!The setting is the hidden African kingdom of Wakanda, where due to an abundance of a an all-powerful mineral called McGuffinite... so, sorry, Vibranium... the leaders have made their city a technological marvel and developed all sorts of ad tech to help the people keep their goats well and weave their baskets better (there are a few odd scenes in this film!). T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) succeeds his father T'Chaka (John Kani) to become the king and adopt the role of The Black Panther, being bestowed superhero powers by drinking a glass of Ribena.But it emerges that T'Chaka has a dark secret in the form of Eric Killmonger (Michael B Jordan, ""Creed"") who is determined to muscle in on the king-stuff. 'It never rains but it pours', and the whole of Wakanda's secrets are in danger of being exposed by the antics of the vicious South African mercenary Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis, ""War For The Planet Of The Apes""), trying to get his hands on vibranium to sell on to CIA operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"", ""The World's End"").After ""Thor: Ragnarok"", this is back to the more seriously-played end of the superhero spectrum: there are a few jokes but it's not overtly played for comedy. Holding the film together are some sterling performances from the ensemble cast with Michael B Jordan very good as the villain of the piece. Adding to the significant black girl power in the film are Angela Bassett (""London Has Fallen"") as the queen mother; Danai Gurira (""Wonder Woman"") as the leader of the Dora Milaje: the all-female king's guard; and Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as the spy and love interest Nakia. But the star performance for me, and one I found absolutely spot-on as a role model for young people, was Letitia Wright (""The Commuter"") as Shuri, the king's chief scientist. She is absolutely radiant, adding beauty, rude gestures and energy to every scene she is in.On the white side of the shop Andy Serkis has enormous fun as Klaue and I really wanted to see more of his character than I did. Martin Freeman feels rather lightweight and under-used, and I couldn't quite get past his dodgy American accent.In terms of storyline, the film is a hotch-potch of plots from multiple other films, with ""The Lion King"" featuring strongly (but almost in reverse!). But that's no crime, when the Shakespearean-style narrative is good, and interpolating the strongly emotional story into the Marvel universe works well.Where I felt a little uncomfortable is the element of racism - that is, racism *against* white people - reflected in the story. If there was a movie plot centred (basically) on the topic of whites killing blacks and taking control of every black-controlled country in the world (yes, I know, I'm British and we have historically been there!) then there would be justified uproar, and the film would be shunned.In the technical department, I had real problems with some of the effects employed. Starting with a dodgy 'aircraft' shadow, things nose-dive with an astonishingly poor waterfall scene with Forest Whitaker (""Rogue One"", ""Arrival"") as Zuri, green-screened against some Disneyworld cascades and hundreds of cut and pasted tribesmen randomly inserted onto the cliffs. Almost matching that is a studio-set scene in a jungle clearing, where if feels they could hardly have bothered to take the plants out of their pots. Think ""Daktari"" quality (kids, ask your parents/grandparents).But overall, the film, directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed""), is a high-energy and uniquely different take on Marvel that absolutely pays off. And it is without doubt an important movie in moving the black agenda forward into properly mainstream cinema.(For the full graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks)."
BLACK PANTHER,4 January 2020,7/10,"Good world-building and character development in this entry to the MCU, including a morally complex villain. The biggest negative here is the uneven use of CGI."
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2019,5/10,"People might think that Black Panther is a great story and etc. As for me, it's just a normal film. It's all about fighting for the throne. To be honest, I've seen it for thousand times in Chinese films, so, it can't amaze me. And in some way, when I see it one more time, I get sick of it. Thus, I'd said the story was just an ordinary.Even though the story isn't that much very different from those ones I always see, I must admit that the effects are quite good. But it still can't make the film to get 9 or 10 stars rating. They still need to improve it to get high rates.All in all, if they could improve the story and everything somehow, it'd be better than this."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,6/10,"I saw this movie today and expected an all action movie, but that's not what I got. Yes, probably a great visual spectacle for anyone not living in Africa, but nothing spectacular otherwise. The real difference is an almost 100% black cast for a big budget movie, which is a first and perhaps made it popular for that very reason.I came away disappointed. The Black Panther didn't do it for me."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2020,10/10,"Nice, fresh, and groundbreaking.Was expecting this to be a Marvel cash grab and was pleasantly surprised.5/5. Loved it!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,9/10,"It's great to escape to other realms and Kingdoms every now and then and this was a Super adventure.
Sci Fi Marvel adventures are not usually my genre of movie but something about the trailer made me want to see this one.
Yes it's the usual testosterone charged romp of good versus evil but what's wrong with that?
Especially when the technical aspects are so fabulous and this movie has a heart.
The CGI at times is breathtaking I may have to try and see it in 3D.
The cast are all terrific, and good to see the women in this movie have equal power and presence.
Surely it must be up for Oscars next year I suspect it missed the deadline for this years.
Highly recommended by me if you like intelligent SciFi action or just like a really good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,9/10,"Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called ""The Stacks"".
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9."
BLACK PANTHER,18 November 2021,7/10,What a great movie. The story is pretty simple but its still pretty interesting to follow. It have some funny moments and interesting action scenes. Even if the end have pretty bad special effects its prety pleasant to follow. And Wakanda is a pretty different location ever seen in a Marvel Movie. Very nice movie.
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,7/10,"They built a brand new world here like they did in Doctor Strange but maybe it's even better in Black Panther with these jaw-dropping smart techs. Every actor did a great job especially Michael B. Jordan who played one of the best villain in superhero movies ever; his motivations are so compelling that make you sympathy with him. The dramatic moments were touching and they are clearly inspired by The Lion King. Unfortunately, the action scenes are very very bad especially with the use of such poor CGI; the characters seemed as they were fully animated in some kind of a computer game. The major issue I have with this movie is the ending; it's so rushed and clich√©d. I think the movie should have been separated into two parts because it ends weirdly, I feel that the ending came out of nowhere; it's very displaced. I hoped to see King T'Challa more stronger as he was in Civil War but they made all the women in the movie stupidly strong that their fight scenes overshadowed Black Panther's. Overall, I had so much fun watching this movie but I think it's so overrated."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"Have to admit this is the first Marvel Movie in a very long time where I didn't enjoy the plot. It's highly derivitive and largely unimaginative. The middle section rambles and the plot twists are poor and predictable.But what Black Panther has going for it is an interesting setting and an exceptional cast. Wakanda is excellently realised. Everyone has a chance to shine. Chadwick Boseman builds well on his excellent showing in Civil War, Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Guria are engaging and very impressive. But there are two big problems for me. Andy Serkis, who chews the scenery marvellously, is killed off far too soon, replaced by Michael B. Jordan's less interesting Killmonger as the main villian, and we have the old utterly predicatable trope where the main hero is believed dead for a strectch during the movie's second half. This is tired. Is anyone fooled by this? I'm also far from convinced that having Wakanda shut off for centuries from the rest of the world was the way to go. It actually made the country look hypocritical.But as I say, the acting saves it. This would have been a barely passable six out of ten but for the excellent cast. Winston Duke's M'Baku is an added bonus. He was fantastic and I hope he gets more screen time in future movies. He has the film's best gag, too."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"The story is straightforward enough. The prologue is set in 1992, where a much younger King T'Chaka visits one of his War Dogs (Wakandans who are supposed to impartially spy on the Outside World) who turns out to be his younger brother Prince N'Jobu! Charges of treason are leveled against the prince, following which......the movie fast-forwards 24 years.That's right. The bulk of the movie is set one week after the ending of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. And the bulk of the script has been brilliantly adapted from the debut story arc in Marvel Comics' ""Jungle Action."" A magazine of the 1970's that helped revive reader interest in Prince T'Challa after his departure from the Silver Age comic book Avengers, ten years earlier. And which first introduced then-teenagers like me to such memorable characters as Erik Killmonger; M'Baku the Man-Ape; and Monica Lynn.Sadly, the latter has been replaced by another, more geographically convenient love interest; the Lady Nakia. But, the other two are still around and refreshingly updated for the 2010's. M'Baku, in particular! In the comics, his tribe/clan worshipped white gorillas (as part of a cult outlawed by the more dominant Panther Clan). Yet, in this movie, they worship a West African avatar of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god).* While Erik Killmonger goes from being a common mercenary to someone with an initially mysterious grudge against T'Challa. Hence, the former's eventual double-cross of Ulysses Klaw (who, btw, goes from East European mad scientist-changed-into-creature-of-living sound, in the comic books, to expatriate South African cyborg in the film).* I don't want to give away too much of the rest of the story. Suffice it to say that Chadwick Boseman gave just as convincing a performance as T'Challa as he did in CA:CW. Thereby making the two hour-and-then-some running time fly by relatively fast. Including the now-customary sneaky epilogues during the ending credits! One strange thing, though. Based on all the advance person-on-the-street interviews I saw on the six o'clock news, this movie was hailed as a revolutionary (and long overdue) first step in bringing an African-American superhero to the silver screen. So, why was most of the audience who went to see this at my hometown multiplex...of the Caucasian persuasion?Ah, well!**Don't ask. Just enjoy."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2020,7/10,"This was a well crafted Marvel film, but it didn't deserve all the hype surrounding it on release. Gifted filmmaker can't transcend the comic genre like Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Black Panther is just a good action film. I'm annoyed this was chosen over other good films for the best film Oscar. I liked the film, but it had too much hype at the time of release. Definitely at the same heights as other Marvel films."
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2020,10/10,"An all star African American cast with the creed director Ryan cooglar.
As wakanda is having an identity crisis with their land full of powerfull space rock called vibranium so as after tragic circumstances forces young Prince T challah to assume the wakanda throne after the aftermath in civil war where the king was killed from the blast. But the character Killmonger is distant and in conflict with the other characters.Erik Killmonger is based on his version in the comics (a Wakandan exile who seeks to overthrow his country), but incorporates elements of T'Shan (T'Challa's envious cousin) and the White Wolf (a relative of the Black Panther who becomes a villainous extremist and wears a Black Panther-styled habit).
The Prince has to face to ultimate test putting his fate of the country and the entire world at risk
But the prince's cousins with
Is greedy friend goes to Korea for to sell vibranium only for the young king to give chase finding them in a casino only to escape to follow them in a thrilling car chase and cgi special effects are stunning
. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war. To find the heart of wakanda
This shows the expansiveness of the mine and the symbolism of the Underground Railroad, which was designed to resemble heart valves for their fight for the heart of Wakanda.
As we saw the winter soldier in wakanda after cival war bucky is given the title of the White Wolf with a new arm. In the comics, the White Wolf was a white man who was adopted and raised in Wakanda; in the film, Bucky is not adopted but he is accepted by some Wakandan citizens.
. He is pitted against his own family the new king must rally his troops and release the full tech power of blank Panther to defeat his enemies and become an avenger and alsoThe Black Panther suit is upgraded in this film to bear mystic runes. This is based on the ""Doomwar"" storyline, where T'Challa developed magical tactics to not rely on his nation's resources of vibranium.
The Wakandan war cry ""Yibambe"" is Xhosa for ""hold strong"". Other possible translations include ""hold fast"" or just simply ""hold it""; all of these translations are appropriate for their situation. This chant was also briefly recited by Nakia and the River Tribe in Black Panther
Vala"" is Xhosa for ""close"" when the warriors activate their shields, as in close ranks
After the climactic battle scene, there is a quick shot of the elders' room. M'Baku is seen amongst the other tribe elders. This shows that T'Challa united all five tribes of Wakanda.
Believe the hype the cgi is amazing.
The first superhero and comic book movie to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,4/10,"Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring."
BLACK PANTHER,10 August 2021,7/10,"This review contains spoilers.Black Panther is a continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that centers on the Black Panther characters that was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. T'challa leads the African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced isolationist country using vibranium. T'challa formally becomes the Black Panther in a ritual but soon discovers an old historical relic that seeks to undo his legacy. Killmonger is revealed to be his uncle's son and seeks the throne of Wakanda for himself.Black Panther is a riveting movie focused on its action set pieces and its setting. Much like the other Marvel movies, Black Panther has highly explosive and plot important action set pieces that have cool effects. The directing is much better at the action rather than the character dialogue. The dialogue has a different feel from the more humorous entries of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy. Black Panther adopts a more serious tone with some touches of comedy. Overall the dialogue is well written and helps bring the viewer into the setting. The setting of Wakanda and characters is easily the more interesting part of this movie. The movie uses this to its advantage by doling out parts of the setting and environment in bits. The culture and people of Wakanda is its more interesting part and by the end of the movie, I still wanted to know more about it.The main arc with Killmonger and T'challa hit some emotional moments but eventually descends into typical superhero stories. Killmonger creates a villain for Wakanda to prioritize. He then returns to the hidden kingdom to enact revenge for his father. He accomplishes this by seemingly killing T'challa and becoming the new Black Panther. Somehow a kingdom that embraces tradition and isolationism embraces his violent actions and commands without rebellion. The movie wanted an excuse to have a large scale battle but did not have the heart to back it.Overall, Black Panther is a strong entry into the Marvel cinematic universe. I would recommend this movie.Grade: C."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Black Panther is the last Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) entry before the highly expected Avengers: Infinity War and it tells the story of T'Challa's (Chadwick Boseman) rise to become King of Wakanda.Right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther returns to the isolated nation of Wakanda, but an old enemy reappears and the King's throne is put to the test. A conflict ensues and the fate of the whole world becomes in danger.Black Panther is one of my most anticipated films of this year (you can check the list HERE) and I couldn't wait to watch it on an IMAX theater. I loved Boseman's presence in Civil War and his action sequences were amazing, so I was super excited to see what his origin movie could bring to the MCU.Well, it is undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise and its place on the top one-third of the MCU is certainly guaranteed. It has a very heartfelt and culturally significant screenplay. This carries an even bigger weight than Wonder Woman did because for the first time in the cinema history, a film with not only a black lead superhero but with a 95% black cast (only two white characters), shines through with an emotional story.The script is remarkably well-written. It has a lot of references to the real world but in the opposite way: Wakanda is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world and for once, black people are not the ones falling behind. I love this aspect of the movie, Ryan Coogler cleverly portrays a world where things are not as everyone thinks they are. This film is demonstrative of how to flawlessly build a world in a cinematic universe.Also an example of perfection, the casting is phenomenal! Marvel never fails in getting the absolute best actors and actresses to portray their respective roles, either these being the lead hero or a secondary character. Everyone has terrific performances, but some are worth mentioning in detail.I will not even start with Boseman. Firstly, I have to write about Michael B. Jordan and his interpretation of the villain, Erik Killmonger. Jordan is incredible, there isn't a single scene where he doesn't shine and he elevates his character. That said, Killmonger is by far the best villain since the beginning of everything (Iron Man (2008)).His compelling journey makes the audience care for him and his beliefs are very true to his heart. He is what he thinks the people need him to be in order for everyone to be able to live freely and protected from the ""bad guys"" running the world. His backstory is very tragic and it sets up a dilemma between him and T'Challa. Erik is notably well-developed and Coogler does a wonderful job co-writing him with Joe Robert Cole.Chadwick Boseman is right up there as well. He fully embodies his character, nailing the accent and making every interaction that he shares with his family or his close friends feel so realistic and full of emotion. T'Challa is an exceptional protagonist, it is easy to stand behind him since his motivations are genuine and passionate. He wants the best for his people and he wants to be an even better King than his father, by trying to correct his past mistakes.I don't even consider T'Challa and Killmonger as the hero and the villain, respectively. Each character has their own perspective and their reasons are both solid, so when the time for their head-to-head comes, I can't really choose a side. Coogler and Cole brilliantly write the characters' script and each one has their own reasons to support either Boseman or Jordan's characters. This is why this movie probably has the best characters in the whole MCU.Lupita Nyong'o beautifully portrays Nakia, a warrior that doesn't rely on tradition that much as she also wants to see the poor people around the world with a better quality of life. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is a badass and her character is also very well-developed, plus she has some cool action sequences. I also would like to congratulate Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue) for his excellent over-the-top performance, as well as Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi), Letitia Wright (super funny as Shuri) and Martin Freeman (Everett K. Ross).Actually, Ross was one of the characters that I left the theater wondering if he was really necessary. Being the only white person in Wakanda, I took a while to fully understand his role. Truthfully, he doesn't introduce or helps to develop any other character and he only has one or two scenes to shine. However, he is important to the cultural value of the film! He is the personification of the rest of the world, he thinks he is several steps ahead of T'Challa and his people, but Freeman ends up being the ignorant of Wakanda's greatness.Like I wrote earlier, this is one of the best installments of the MCU. Culturally, it means a lot and the story has a lot of substance. The cinematography looks gorgeous, the nation of Wakanda is very well designed through CGI and the editing is great throughout the whole runtime. The epic score is one of the highlights. A lot of praise has been given to Kendrick Lamar for the rap vibe that he implements in the movie, but nothing beats the African traditional sounds that elevate not only the action scenes but every single moment.Nevertheless, this film is not perfect. While its tone is well-balanced, its pacing not so much. The first act drags too much and it feels that some scenes could have been left out. From the first ritual battle onwards, the movie starts getting its pace right and the entertainment level gets higher. However, the plot follows a predictable path and it ends up on a disappointing note ... Coogler doesn't do good directing the most important action scene.The CGI might be very good and it is indeed well-controlled during the film, but it is misused in the climactic fight at the end. I mean, the first ritual battle between T'Challa and (at the time) a random character is way more exciting and better filmed (good handling of the shaky cam and the water splashes effects are pretty cool) than the supposedly epic showdown with Killmonger. Leaving the theater disappointed with the fight is never a good sign, especially when there are so many awesome action moments during the film. Apart from this, a couple of exposition scenes could have been told in a better way, but these are all minor issues that I have with one of the best superhero movies in the most recent years.All in all, Black Panther lives up to the hype and it does not fail. With an extraordinary cast, Boseman and Jordan lead a very heartfelt and emotional story, filled with fantastic characters and beautiful world-building. Killmonger is the absolute standout as the best villain of the entire MCU, the script is on-point for every character and the plot is very well-written, even if it becomes predictable. Technically great, but not flawless. While the cinematography, the editing and mainly the score elevate the film, the first act's slow pacing and the extremely disappointing climactic battle between the two leads bring down the movie, ending it on a bittersweet note. Still, this is surely in the top one-third of the MCU and I can't wait for Avengers: Infinity War!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 July 2018,4/10,"Grace Jones looking chics :) That was your first clue... Don't mess with Grace Jones.That was cold.Tough job interview.

Excruciating.Some cool stuff, but disappointing story. I wanted to like it but, not compelling. Glad I didn't go to the theatre for this."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,"Feels like a Shakespearean play and this is why the film works so well. It has a great story and one of the best screenplays Marvel has ever prodded. It offers a strong story with many interesting characters, mixes this with great action scenes and delivers a great visuality in general.
The only thing that could have been better was the acting. Why everybody was solid nobody really was at the top of their game. I guess that is still something Marvel has to learn, now that they stat to produce great screenplays. Again, dont get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman was great in the leading role but I felt that his co stars Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael B. Jordan were there and just did their thing without much passion. I also thought Forest Whitaker once again adds an overacting credit to his resume, which is a shame. Angela Bassett was good and I really liked Martin Freeman and Danai Gurira. Andy Serkis also made a decent villain.
Daniel Kaluuya also doesnt really live up to his recent Oscar nomination and I felt the performance of Letitia Wright was a bit off. But other than that it is close to a masterpiece. Besides the great screenplay it has a fantastic direction by Ryan Coogler and many nice twists. I really liked the mythology it created and look forward to many more visits to Wakanda."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the sixth film in Phase 3 of the series. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), it sets the bar to an all time high for Marvel films and provides a brilliant lead-in to Avengers: Infinity War.Shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his country of Wakanda in Africa to be crowned as its new King. However, upon arriving home, T'Challa finds his position as King challenged by a old enemy whose intentions are far more sinister than merely seizing leadership over Wakanda and its citizens.Featuring some of the best written supporting characters and action scenes in a Marvel film, Black Panther is a benchmark in the series and is easily one of its best standalone films. The film's world building element showcases the vibrant and futuristic look of Wakanda, a fictional African country proudly entrenched its heritage and tradition. We also gain a somewhat James Bond/Jason Bourne vibe from the film at times, with its spy thriller elements and exciting car chases. Director Ryan Coogler does a suburb job fleshing out the main villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), whose motives go beyond merely world domination and lust for power. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as the title character, the serious but kindhearted King who only wants what is best for his people, as was briefly touched on in Captain America: Civil War. Like with every other film in the series, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2019,1/10,"Igual que me queje cuando nominaron a Lady Bird, me quejo este a√±o por esta nominaci√≥n. Pero es que la otra al menos ten√≠a cosas buenas. En esta pel√≠cula, es que no se libra nada. Como se puede hacer tan mal una pel√≠cula. ¬øQu√© dir√≠amos si nominaran a Iron man? Pues lo mismo le pasa a esta pel√≠cula.Los actores est√°n terribles. No se libra ninguno. Que mal est√°n todos.Los efectos, no pueden ser peores, pero si es que no est√°n integrados ninguno. Los cromas se notan todos.La iluminaci√≥n es lo √∫nico que no es malo del todo. Pero que tampoco es para tierra cohetes.El director no sabe por d√≥nde se mueve. La escenas de lucha iniciales, no hay quien las vea. Despu√©s mejora eso s√≠. Con ese material podr√≠a rodar espectacular y lo hace muy sencillo.La he terminado de ver para hacer una cr√≠tica en serio. Pero es terrible. Es predecible. El guion es horrible.Just as I complained when they nominated Lady Bird, I complained this year about this nomination. But the other one at least had good things. In this movie, nothing is being waged. How can a movie be made so badly? What would we say if they nominated Iron Man? Well, the same thing happens to this movie.The actors are terrible. No one is spared. How bad they all are.The effects can not be worse, but if none are integrated. Chromas are all noticed.Lighting is the only thing that is not bad at all. But that is not for earth rockets either.The director does not know where he is moving. The initial fight scenes, there is no one to see them. After that, it improves. With that material could shoot spectacular and makes it very simple.I have finished seeing it to make a serious criticism. But it is terrible. It is predictable. The script is horrible."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther was super cool. The actor who plays the lead does a great job. The unique sets and costumes of Wakanda were a treasure and hopefully we get a lot more major motion pictures with diverse cultures that can fill the screen.The film has a great moral dilemma about how a king from a wealthy African nation faces his inner demons when he deals with a deadly relative who has been subjected to the abuses his people face in the western world. The Black Panther costume is great, too. Another Marvel masterpiece! Worth seeing in 3D or IMAX."
BLACK PANTHER,8 January 2021,1/10,"Black Panther the worst movie which I watched from Marvel and likely the worst for 2019. And from where such ratings? For an idiotic and crazy plot even by the standards of the pictures Marvel Studios? For Afro-American cast? For logical and subject holes? Yes it is so boring movie that I watched 2 times and the second time continued because decided to look through. Well as the African country only I thank to one material can bypass the rest of the world? The only ""light spot"" of this movie, is kind of ironic it did not sound - Martin Freeman. The high ratings of Black Panther is a spittle to all world cinema, it is all the same on the movie. He empty and through passage, in 5-10 years will remember nobody him. But awards the Oscar and other recognition ""allegedly critics"" just causes irritation."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"With the glut of superhero movies being released in theatres, one of the things that I credited movies like Deadpool and Logan for was trying to tell a more personable story. It doesn't have to be about saving the world, just introduce some characters we can enjoy following and provide some motivation we can relate to. Black Panther centres around the rivalry/conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger and I think that's an interesting choice. Killmonger is a shadowy version of what T'Challa could have been and the movie brings you along with their new king's struggle to understand his father's and his uncle's actions. But the important thing about this is you understand the differing perspectives of the characters and while you're cheering for T'Challa, you can at least understand where Killmonger is coming from. Their situation doesn't come with an easy answer and this problem compounds T'Challa's other issues (dealing with the death of his father, the responsibilities of running Wakanda, Nakia not reciprocating his affection for her etc.). The character development in this movie was pretty good and I appreciated the effort put in that way.The strength of this movie is that its effective in bringing you into this new and exciting environment. The kingdom of Wakanda is beautiful and is a pleasant change of pace for a Marvel movie. They play up the more traditional aspects of life in Africa while providing a new spin on it. It makes it easier to digest some bits of exposition and I would credit Coogler and his team for doing something off-beat. The cinematography was excellent, and the special effects were first rate. Couple that with some interesting technology and gadgets for our heroes and villains to interact with, there are few scenes where they don't utilize something fun to punch up the action or even the drama.This movie is populated by accomplished actors and actresses, but I was legitimately surprised on who impressed me the most. Chadwick Boseman is a star on the rise. He's got a lot of ability and charisma and while I enjoy his more dramatic performances (Marshall and 42) he slips into Black Panther with ease. Michael B. Jordan had a lot of energy in his performance and he was obviously giving it his all. He's a lot better in this compared to the Fantastic 4 but he was still bordering on overacting for me. I would give him credit for being one of the more impactful Marvel villains of recent memory. Andy Serkis is having a blast in the other villainous role as Ulysses Klaue. He's an awesome actor who doesn't get his due. Daniel Kaluuya was good after his breakout in Get Out, he's very measured here and strong. It was fun to see Lupita Nyong'o, she owned her scenes completely. Letita Wright gave one of the funnier performances in the film as T'Challa's sister Shuri. My favourite performance came from Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She sold all her scenes; her character has a strict code of honour that came across well in her acting. She is passable as a military leader (which is no mean feat) and yet there were some moments in the movie where she managed to be funny as well. She was very well rounded and deserves credit in her supporting role.One of the reasons that this movie will be so popular is that it is promoting diversity. We don't get many African-American superheroes (let alone a superhero from Africa) so it is important to get them right when they get the chance. Black Panther tackles this challenge as well as they could have. Not only is the story interesting and the actors/actresses are clearly on their game, but they incorporate how difficult it can be to come from the background that these fictional characters come from. It is not only addressed but it is at the forefront and they don't falter. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise considering who is involved with this project, but it is worth mentioning nonetheless.The biggest problem that this movie suffered from isn't even the fault of the people who made it. The hype surrounding Black Panther got a little out of control. Is this a good movie? Absolutely. Is it one of the better standalone Marvel films? You can absolutely make that argument. Best Marvel movie ever? For me, not even close. It absolutely deserves praise for the things that it gets right but people need to calm down a little. I would put this firmly in the middle somewhere, Marvel is the victim of continued success that way so simply making a good film doesn't qualify as doing something amazing for the studio (a comparison I would use is A Bug's Life or Brave, both are good movies but compared to the rest of Pixar's output, neither are exceptional). I had a couple of smaller issues, the action was very middle of the road, I didn't find a show-stopping moment in any of the fight scenes. Some of the characters arcs weren't satisfying, I feel like the only reason Martin Freeman's Everett Ross was included was to connect to the rest of the MCU, he had little to do on his own.Another few months go by and another exciting/action-packed movie put out by Marvel Studios. This has become the norm and while some people are growing sick of it, if they keep putting out quality material, I'm open to it. Black Panther isn't the second coming for comic book movies but that shouldn't detract from the fact this is a great movie. I would give this an 8.5/10 but I can't quite give it a 9/10. So, I have to go with an 8/10, I would recommend this to comic and non-comic fans alike."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,2/10,"But i could not. Everything in this movie is sub-par with the rest of hollywood.. Maybe it was just a poor screening., but here were my problems. THe movie is mostly dark skinned people..This is not a problem at all except for when it comes to lighting. The lighting is terrible. For the frist 20 minutes of the movie we are in dark..we can barely see and the characters are black...Why do this? After the sun shows up we get a plane arriving scene that is just out of focus...either the screen was blurry in some areas or it was out of focus camera...THe music is the worst sound track i Have ever heard ever..And the Plot..the worst part of the film was so slow and pointless."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,8/10,"This is everything the hype around it promised. Extremely political without forcing it down your throat, the sole existence of Wakanda and its lifestyle is a major political statement. But the flaws of the film's politics is also to be considered, the complex situations and characters creates a rift in the moral and political correctness that are put forward by the film both of which are only met half way. Wait, is that a flaw of the film or just telling us the reality where there is no real end to any conflicts?"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"As a comic book movie, Black Panther represents a rare feat - something that stands on its own without franchise tie-ins or guest heroes, something that works as both drama and adventure without going too dark, something that manages to be about something without ever slowing down. I could have complained about the plot's predictability...but I was too damn busy enjoying it. As a social moment, Black Panther represents something pretty unique too. Not to overstate things, but I have literally never been to a movie theater with this much palpable energy and anticipation. The whole place was ready and waiting for a different kind of superhero movie. But even with ALL the hype, the movie managed to surpass expectations. Put simply: this film was special."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,5/10,I'd heard how great this was and about how much money it made so I was expecting a lot but this movie left me scratching my head. No one stood out in this. The kid from Get Out was terrible in this - it felt like he just got thrown in the movie because he was in Get Out and not because he was truly the right choice for the movie. It's almost like he was smirking throughout the film. Someone else would have been better in this. He was not good. Everyone kept saying how funny the sister was so I was expecting a real laugh riot-I laughed one time. This whole movie was very sedate - almost like you could fall asleep to it. Plus it felt like a lot of girl power - like I seriously thought that at one point the women were just gonna take over and run everything. And can I just say I think Forest Whitaker is overrated? I don't think he has much range and while everyone else seemed to do well with the accent - he sounded like he couldn't do it. I usually love Martin Freeman but he was so bland in this.I do not think this is deserving of all the accolades. Yes it has a mostly all black cast and that's great but that doesn't mean it equals brilliance or an amazing story. This was just ho hum. Disappointing.
BLACK PANTHER,17 January 2019,2/10,"I was looking forward to this but almost from the beginning I knew this was not going t be good.
The story was silly and very unbelievable.
Acting was wooden and the accents awful.
Why use Martin Freeman to play an American, no American actors I guess?
Fighting unrealistic and I could not believe the Black Panther character could win anything.
The ending was even sillier than the rest of the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"I was very excited to see this movie, but found it for most part boring, the futuristic world they live in on today earth, there advancement in scientific knowledge, and the new but hated black panther suit.Black panther was so much better in Captain America Civil War, than in this whole movie...."
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2018,6/10,"Definitely a different film with more in depth technicalities on new tech but it lacks a gripping story/screenplay/dialogues and mostly the characterisation was not so heavy to hold upto that character's potential, to be specific. It somehow in the corner of the heart felt like a childish movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 August 2021,4/10,"One of the worst Marvel films, the story of the film was very bad, the villain of the film was one of the worst, all the characters in the film were bad, it was strange that it was nominated for the best film of the year."
BLACK PANTHER,6 September 2018,3/10,"This will be short and sweet. After about 1 hour, I'm still trying to figure out if this is a Black musical, Black culture movie, a Crime solvers movie, or a bizarre ethereal movie...'cause it sure as heck isn't a super hero movie, which I thought it was supposed to be...The plot, if you can find it, seems to be about a wannabe super hero, that people saw in another movie (I didn't, sorry), who goes back to his mysterious, technological country, that happens to be invisible, to do something that I never did figure out, but was sorta explained in the synopsis, that didn't make sense to me anyway...So, you see, I'm rather lost on how to give this one a knowledgeable review...But I tried, heh heh...**Update 45 minutes later**Ok, I think I figured out why this movie is so slap dash boring to me...apparently Marvel decided to produce Black Panther as only an International (foreign) release, so it doesn't fit into an American concept of a superhero movie...then decided to subtitle half the movie, and released it in the US too...THAT is as much sense as I can make out of it all..."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2020,9/10,"Was expecting something of Christopher Nolan quality after all the hype and Oscar nomination. Sadly not even close. Especially the directing. Overly long too. Some good acting though, decent story, and much better than most superhero movies. That all said, don't believe the hype!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 September 2018,8/10,"A less typical Marvel superhero movie which has great special effects, a superb African culture and setting, and a more human story. The story is good, with some surprises and a balanced mix of action, character development, and humour, but it does drag on at times and has a few holes. The wide range of characters each have their own appeal and show a much more human side to the proceedings, but none really stood out and the villains were disappointing in their simplistic desires. The special effects and fight scenes are great, being fast paced, energetic and not overly destructive, but as with most Marvel movies, the hero is too indestructible and as a consequence, any threat to him never seems real."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,"I was extremely impressed by Black Panther, and felt that it went beyond superficial action hero movie themes and quality. The technical aspects were excellent, with beautiful visuals, a great score, and good action. What really set Black Panther apart from other MCU movies was the consistency and the depth of themes discussed. The character arcs of T'Challa and Killmonger were both very well done, and all of the complex explanation of how Wakanda and the Black Panther came to exist were coherent and relatively clear. Many themes were well explored, such as African culture, isolationism, and ancestry. I didn't think the conflict development was anything special (felt like a simplified version of The Dark Knight Rises), and the climax was good, not great. Excellent ending and post-credit scenes do a great job of clearly showing how the story ties into the MCU without weighing down the movie by forcing references. All in all, a great movie, and one that's likely to be one of my favorites of 2018."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,3/10,"Well this was a major disappointment. Terrible acting, awful dialogue and characters that I had no empathy with. From the moment this film started, it looked very bad. How people can award this pap 10 is beyond me. I paid ¬£3 to rent this from my local DVD store (yes, we still have one). I feel I was robbed. To make a good film you need a strong script, natural dialogue, and people who can act. Just selecting good looking people (that can't act) and then throwing a lot of money at the project gives you this."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,8/10,"I was waiting with great anticipation for this film and it was not disappointing. Though some of the dialog wasn't the greatest and there were some missed opportunities to do more The Black Panther lived up to its hype. It was great to see so many black actors doing a stellar job in this film. Chadwick Boseman and Michael Jordan are terrific. It was great to see Sterling Brown, even in a minor role. But the women were the standouts, sorry guys; it is great to see so many film coming out with strong women characters. Watching them was the most fun I'd had at a movie for a while. I hope to see more of them in the future."
BLACK PANTHER,7 October 2020,5/10,"Annoying soundtrack (sometimes), poor plot, some mismatch.
The power of the hero is like... boh. Something popping out of nowhere.."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2019,7/10,This is a pretty decent movie but it's not great. Some of the editing feels off. Some of the acting is pretty good though as I like the main guy and I like the villain. It basically went exactly as you'd expect though so it didn't do anything new and it didn't do anything unexpected. Basically all these origin stories are almost exactly the same. I did like that it was like a different society but some of that made no sense. They're a super advanced technology but use spears. Really? I mean I know they're different spears that can take down aircraft and such but when they're fighting each other they're just spears. It's ridiculous. Decent end though I suppose. I liked it more than this review indicates probably.
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,2/10,"Without a doubt this is a culturally important film, one with an important message to tell its audience. We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact. Wakanda is, in essence, an African fantasy, one in which the continent is able to withstand white oppressors and consequentially has the power to build an empire off Vibranium, a natural resource that is more powerful than steel. And many of us enjoy seeing people of color on the big screen. After a century, Hollywood may be waking up to the fact that Black heroes are actually bankable. Surprise!Wakanda is hidden behind clouds and mountains, and a fantasy rain forest canopy. But wait a minute. It is a sci fi film with advanced aircraft. Doesn't that mean the world possesses radar, and satellites? Well, then why have the clouds and rain forest kept this place such a secret for so long? DO NOT ask questions like these, of this film. If you are the kind of individual who can suspend your reason and intellect for two hours, and just watch, you may enjoy this. Personally, I felt alot of pain while watching this film. I might put it in the category of Lone Ranger, and Wild, Wild West. It really stank, as a story. The capital is from the evils of white colonizers, but any sort of imagination is left in the back seat when it comes to this emerald city onscreen. It's a missed opportunity on the part of Coogler because, after all, this is an MCU movie set in Africa! I wanted to see the savannas and the fantastic natural sights and beauties that come with this fascinating and colorful continent, but instead, there's an over-reliance on fake digital backgrounds rather than real on-set locations. This is detrimental to bringing any kind of humane connection or absorbingly artful feeling to the film, which quite frequently feels artificial and computerized rather than lived-in and three-dimensional.To sum it up, if you like comic book films, you may like this one. I do not like comic book films, and I really, really did not like this film."
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2021,7/10,I loved the storyline and all the characters and all the VFXs too.
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther kicks off really promisingly with an animated/CGI prologue that establishes the history of Wakanda and why they're as secretive as they are, before jumping to 1992 in California and a conflict between King T'Chaka and his younger brother who's been placed as a spy in Oakland. This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there. Instead Black Panther decides to build slowly, spending it's time on developing characters and world-building to establish the cultures and technologies of Wakanda, a previously unseen fictional country of the MCU.But honestly, I didn't mind the slower pace, because the world-building is so good. Wakanda is a nation built from five tribes, and each of them are drastically different from one another, with their own technologies, their own role in Wakandan society, and their own fashions and associated colours. T'Challa's tribe is the royal blood, the keepers of the Vibranium and the spiritual realm, including the spirit of the Black Panther that gives him his powers. There's a border tribe that lives on the outskirts of the country and keeps outsiders out. They appear more impoverished than the rest of the country, but of course it's only a front to save face. They live in huts, breed battle rhinos (you read that right), and have technology that revolves around shielding and defence. There's also the river tribe adorned in shells and turquoise colours, the sun tribe emblazoned in gold, and the outcast mountain tribe who cause a minor nuisance every chance they get.Honestly Black Panther's biggest strength is it's costuming/makeup and production design. There is no other movie that looks like Black Panther. It's aesthetic that marries traditional African designs and colours with wealthy/futuristic tech and architecture is unique. One of the River Tribe is a dapper-looking guy in a turquoise suit with traditional African lip plate, which is an equally bizarre and awesome aesthetic. General clothing is emblazoned in African patterns and colours with a modern stylising, and many characters show off tribal tattooing like facial scarification. Many walk around barefoot despite the obvious advancements in technology to be able to craft shoes and sandals (both of which T'Challa wears himself). The cityscape is full of futuristic skyscrapers topped off with African huts and buildings.But the traditional African aesthetic just stop there, it also leaks into the music, combining effortlessly with both modern Hip-Hop and your typical flavour of orchestral film score, sometimes all at the same time. I'm listening to the Kendrick Lamar-curated accompaniment album now and I'll admit I'm not digging it (although Pray For Me with The Weekend is pretty good), but the film's score is a different entity entirely. It makes a lot of use of African percussion, with the talking drum being instrumental in the film's audible identity, being used as both a main theme for the film, as well as providing some really good tension. As well as this there's often a typical hip-hop beat that comes in and out and instantly makes any and every scene it's used in feel inherently cooler and more badass. The orchestral element is, in typical Marvel fashion, still a little by-the-numbers at best, and just plain misused at worst. Even so Ludwig Goransson has crafted probably the most unique score Marvel have ever enjoyed (better even than Ragnarok, and Guardians doesn't count because that was all licensed).But I feel I've been focussing too much on the stylistic merits of Black Panther. They're undoubtedly the film's strongest suites, but that doesn't mean the rest of the film falls to the wayside. The story takes a while to pick up, it's true, but once it does it becomes full of political intrigue, and drives home it's message of worldwide responsibility. Killmonger is a fairly typical African-American who feels entitled by virtue of his skin colour, while ultimately not really understanding what his heritage means. He wants to use Wakandan tech to destabilise the world's governments and put Africans on the top of the world ladder for once. Meanwhile both Nakia and Shuri see the potential in Wakanda reaching out and providing aid to the countries that need it. While both viewpoints are stark opposites, they both revolve around Wakanda ditching its secretive nature and taking a more diplomatic standpoint on the world stage.Killmonger as a villain isn't too bad. While I wouldn't say he's a great villain in his own right, when compared to the rest of the Marvel villain roster, he's certainly one of the more developed ones. Wronged at a young age, he seeks to return to what he sees as his birthright. He has motivations and an intertwined history with T'Challa and the Wakandan royal family. I mean, compared to the likes of Malekith or Kaecilius, Killmonger is a breath of fresh air. Similar could be said of Andy Serkis' return as Ulysses Klaue, who is also not a particularly engaging villain in his own right, but Serkis just chews up the scenery (not only that, but beefed up with a tightly grown beard, and a waistcoat barely big enough to contain him, he's looks pretty badass).Chadwick Boseman gets almost the entire movie to flex his muscles as T'Challa, and manages really well to keep him the wise-beyond-his-years king. I'm not entirely convinced he can hold a whole movie himself though, as Black Panther was definitely kept afloat more by its supporting cast than by its lead. Luipta Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Winston Duke, and even Sterling K. Brown's small appearance all join together to give the movie an acting backbone to be proud of.Is Black Panther one of the best Marvel movies to date? I don't think so. It doesn't always hit the mark, and it's action sequences just become a blur of boring choreography, and its story is an interesting one, but feels a little diluted and probably too on-the-nose. From a stylistic viewpoint though, Black Panther not only stands out from the crowd of Marvel movies, but from blockbusters in general. I can't wait to see more of Wakanda in a few months come Infinity War. I give Black Panther a solid 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"It's been ranked on several lists as one of the most-if not the most-anticipated movie of the year, and thankfully it did not disappoint. There are some flaws in it, but for the most part it was a good movie that seemed to please everyone in the theater. Whether it's the best movie in the MCU thus far is up for debate, but it is undeniably a contender.
 I'll start by talking about the weaker points of the movie, because there were a lot more strong points. The main problem that people seemed to have in the initial reviews that I read was Michael B. Jordan's antagonist character. I didn't think he was half-bad, but I could see why people might not like him as a villain. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) was also pretty weak as a villain, even though the threat he poses is pretty good. The introduction of the characters and their relationships was another weak point. There were a decent amount of minor characters that are featured throughout and it would have been nice to give a little more attention to them early on and clarify their roles a little better. The only other small problem I had was that the Wakandan's manner of speech was too formal. Yes, they're a tribal country that is supposed to speak English as a second language, but it still seems like they should have been less uptight.
 Even with those problems, it was about as good as I'd hoped it would be. The visuals and set design were obviously really good, but the movie doesn't get carried away with showing off cool fictional tech or other CGI eye-candy at any point. Superhero movies are not generally considered art, and this is no exception, but there are several shots that seem deliberate and motivated in a way that informs the story. T'Challa wasn't the most interesting character, but he's definitely an active and human protagonist and there are several really good moments where he has to make tough decisions and face hard truths. Tied in with this is the political argument, which was very reminiscent of the one in ""Captain America: Civil War"". I, and the three people I saw it with, thought that the political conflict was handled really well and was possibly the best aspect of the movie, which is a pretty rare thing for a super-hero action movie. It's relevant to some timeless and even a couple of current social issues, namely immigration.
 However, this does not mean that fans of traditional superhero action will be disappointed. While there are not a ton of action scenes, there are three or four big set pieces that were pretty good, and one early on that features some of the best action I've seen since ""Fury Road"". 
 The characters are not the strongest here, which may be accounted for by the fact that almost all of them are new. Even the familiar faces of T'Challa, T'Chaka, and Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) were given minimal attention in ""Civil War"". The characters are written well in that their motives are clear, plausible, and create good conflict in each scene, which is something that many movies like this do a poor job with.
 There was some decent humor in it. A couple of the jokes fell flat or were annoying, but there was definitely a quality over quantity strategy in terms of comedy here. I must say that the soundtrack was a bit of a letdown, featuring none of the music that I loved from the trailer. The score wasn't bad, but I had been hoping for some more good beats and jams, and I don't think I was alone in that. 
 You'll understand things a little better if you've seen ""Civil War"" already, but you can really follow the movie just fine without having seen any of the MCU movies preceding it. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely worth the ticket price. Regardless of your expectations walking into the theater, you are not likely to be disappointed walking out. Overall Rating: 7.9/10."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,9/10,"Black Panther - Really refreshing for the MCU, not that much was wrong with it, but this has a totally different vibe than most previous films, The Black Panther character itself owes much more to the Pulp heroes of 30's and 40's than most other superheroes around, and the high-tech spy thriller setting mixed with the royal family of an African nation and one of the Marvel's best written villains(anti-heroes?) yet, is a powerful combination!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther had a great introduction in Captain America:Civil War, but having read comics all my life, I still didn't know a lot about him. I didn't know Wakanda was so ahead of the world with technology, or any of the character lore. Yes, this is kind of an origin story, but it's done in a way that it doesn't necessarily feel like it. The scenery is beautiful, and the characters are great. The women really kick butt, and the villains are very good. Andy Serkis especially seems to have a lot of fun with his role. I didn't really expect humour, but as with Marvel tradition, there is a good amount as well. Overall, a fun continuation of the dominating Marvel movies, and yet another that I will add to my collection!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2018,7/10,"Black Panther had quite the buzz. I finally got to see it and was pleasantly surprise. Often these big buzz movies are a let down. It tells the story of Wakanda, a country in Africa that has pretty much stayed true to itself. The black panther is pass down in a monarchy chosen by the people. Black Panther wants to pass along some good to the world and opens this nation to the eyes of others. Many scenes from Atlanta and good to see a new character brought to life on the big screen. Wakanda forever. Dr Wilson Trivi√±o"
BLACK PANTHER,2 January 2019,8/10,"This is a great superhero origin story, blending the futuristic technology with traditional African customs in a way that you can't help but consider cool. Serkis gave arguably the best performance in the film, though Jordan was also a convincing and relatable character. T'Challa himself rarely expressed serious emotions, and the lack of a strongly relatable hero is the primary reason why I don't consider this one of the best Marvel films so far."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2020,7/10,"When I watched it at home with my girlfriend I realised that this film had much more to give, in the form of very different, very important female characters that kicked arse and remained feminine. She was fist pumping and remarking plenty on the characters and investing in all the Marvel silliness.Points about radicalisation and nationalism are touched on, and it's great to see Wakanda as a nation similar to Africa if it hadn't been colonised. But the rest of the politics are shaky and the story and beats plain, and I still maintain that killing instead of uniting with Kilmonger feels like the wrong move.It's a shaky film in parts and rereads a lot of old ground. But sometimes using simple and repeatable archetypes and moulds are important in the early stages of representation and inclusivity.I'm confident that a bold Black Panther 2 could tell a new and important story with the same great characters."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,1/10,"First, the acting was so bad. Angela Basset and Forrest Whitaker are some of the worst actors working in Hollywood. They constantly talk with such dramatic poise and make facial flourishes that no normal person would ever do, and neither of them behave like this in real life, but every movie they do, they put on this theatrical performance. Just watch closely and see it. it is painfully bad.Then if you can accept the bad acting you have to accept the ludicrous premise, which is basically the primitive tribe is this sophisticated people. it would have been more interesting if it wasn't this stereotypical African primitive tribe, but instead a real sophisticated group of people.Just typical badly written Hollywood film. filled with one cliche after another. you rarely find a film that dares to take a different approach and surprise us with a unique way of telling a story.I for one, won't pretend that a king would have women as security guards. nor will I pretend that this type of place remotely ever existed, and that's okay."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,2/10,"Lion King meets a terrible 1980's sitcom. The CGI is some of the worse ever, the plot is as dull as a mother superior on laundry day but laughable in many places, the music oh dear lord. As for cliches, well you could write a whole page on it, didnt think anything could be as bad as Wonder Woman or Justice League but this topped it by a distance. Poor old Stan Lee, he doesnt even get a gag, he just looks like he is suffering from wind and wanted to be back home. Awful garbage, wait till some small TV company buys it and it's on a Sunday tea-time in a few years and save some money."
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2020,9/10,"While I don't think that ""Black Panther,"" quality-wise, deserves all the hype it got after it was released, there is no denying that its cultural impact is, well, significant. That impact alone does deserve the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,7/10,"I'm not a huge comic book movie guy, so I probably enjoyed this just about as much as I could! Lots of great action, a decent plot, and some seriously kickin' acting! In fact, the Black Panther was probably my 6th or 7th favorite character, behind his sister, both bad guys, the head of the rhino tribe, the head of the gorilla tribe, and definitely way behind my super favorite - Okoye! She was amazing! Give that character her own movie please! I also enjoyed the Oakland connection! And I really enjoyed the music! In fact, after I watched this movie, I was really feeling the tunes, and I fell to sleep listening to South African musician Vusi Mahlasela's cd ""Naledi Ya Tsela (Guiding Star)"". Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther, to which I took foster son yesterday. Like many parents, I've taken him to many superhero movies. He loves them; each time, though, we're sitting there seeing white people/men doing amazing things in America or Europe. How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun. More, please."
BLACK PANTHER,28 July 2018,7/10,"The people, sets, and costumes of the fascinating Wakanda are a fantastic breath of fresh air, and the supporting characters especially (Nakia, Okoye, Shuri) all beg for further fleshing out. As an action film it worked better with Serkis' simpler villain (see the awesome South Korea sequence) than Jordan's more complex one, as the good vs. evil nuances he introduced deserved a slower drama instead of a sudden civil war and typical superhero climax (though the epilogue was of course touching)."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,5/10,"With all the hype in the theaters, I was like REALLY??? Then the media gave this movie alot of hype. Well I know why. Not my king!!! Maybe just change it to ( Not my president). U can see the political agenda. If Marvel wants to go THAT route? They will loose fans quickly like NFL or the Grammys. The humor? Terrible, (what are those?), (Shut up or I'll feed u to my children!! No we're vegetarians....hahahaha!!) Lame jokes. The worst thing is this is a remake of the Lion King. It doesn't take any brains to see that. So ALL the 6 or above out of 10s have to be FAKE votes. Funny I don't read reviews before watching a movie, I'm not the only one who sees Lion King in this movie. Just YouTube it, it's real. I WILL NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN, no need."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,"The Black Panther The Black Panther tells the story of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) the newly crowned king of Wakanda.
A fictional technologically advanced African nation.
T'Challa's throne is challenged by a brutal outsider named Erik Killmonger played by the excellent Michael B Jordan.
He has his own rights to the crown and will stop at nothing to get it.
The safety of Wakandas people are threatened by Killmongers ideas to expose and exploit the resources and technology of their hidden nation.
Only the protector, The Black Panther can stop him.Not quite the revelation that the hype would have you believe but still a very good entry into the Marvel cinematic universe.
Ryan Cooglers film certainly has its own unique look and flavour that differentiates it from anything that has gone before.
Often a visual feast but there are some jarring effects that will slap the keen eyed audience members in the face.
A particular cliff side scene springs to mind that doesn't best display where the movies 200 million dollar budget has gone.In many ways The Black Panther is Marvels own take on Batman.
Not quite as dark and serious as the caped crusader but there are some similarities.
He has the coolest gadgets and runs around kicking ass dressed as an animal.
I thoroughly enjoyed Ryan Cooglers movie but unlike his last offering the brilliant Creed, his latest movie isn't as polished.
Black Panther suffers from an overblown first act and a seemingly rushed second and third.
When Killmonger arrives at Wakanda baring a gift that will grant him the right to challenge for the throne the movie begins to pick up pace at an alarming rate. 
By doing so it loses focus on what's needed to drive the story and get the audience all roused up.
T'Challa's defeat at the hands of Killmonger is quickly dealt with.
His road to redemption is even more Spritely handled.
Unlike Rocky Balboa's journey back from defeat in Rocky III or Bruce Wayne's climb back from Banes ass whooping in The Dark Knight Rises, T'Challa is merely given a mouthful of herbal tea and then sent back on his way for his second showdown.
Too much time is spent in the first third of the movie with our hero chasing around the weak villain Ulysses Klaue played effortlessly by Andy Serkis.
Such a brilliant actor who is given an underdeveloped villain to play for a second time in the last twelve months.
Anyone who has seen The Last Jedi will know where I'm coming from.
Putting this aside this movie still manages to succeed due to its fantastic cast and superior direction. A shame then that the action scenes aren't dealt with as slickly as I would have liked.
In Civil War BP's introduction was an awesome one.
His fighting style jumped right off the screen. In this movie he seems less accomplished.
The action scenes are more CGI orientated and often look like
in-game video clips from a PlayStation that fail to trick the eye.
There isn't really a single standout moment regarding action that will linger in the memory.
Even a scene with an armoured stampeding rhino falls by the wayside.
Indeed the Black Panther looked more spectacular when taking on Captain America or his roof top brawl with the Winter soldier in Civil War.
Perhaps the greatest fight scenes are those involving The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira.
Her character Okoye was easily the most bad ass of all in the movie. She could be the next big action star proving she's just as capable with a spear as she is with a Samurai sword.When all is said and done this movie is still a pretty decent one.
A pretty good one in fact. 
No movie is perfect. Some are just closer than others.
There's lots to get excited about here. The fantastic soundtrack, the sweeping landscapes. The top notch performances by all involved.
On the other hand it's the basic superhero stuff where this film falters a little.
Fight scenes are a bit messy, CGI is a little unpolished in places and certain characters are underdeveloped and under used.
Still I do recommend you go watch it and I'll even probably buy the Blu-ray."
BLACK PANTHER,26 September 2020,9/10,"""I never yielded! And as you can see, I am not dead!""Black Panther was such a cultural signpost for everyone, and a great MCU superhero movie as well. As a young Marvel reader, I always wondered why the character was not used more at the time. He had a great origin story and was pretty kick ass. But finally, his time arrived, and he showed them all. Director Ryan Coogler was a great choice to make this movie.This movie hits all the usual superhero beats, while also being a landmark moment in black culture. It's a real honest to goodness epic tale. Wakanda comes to life so wonderfully that you wish it were real. So many great actors get to fill these roles we've only ever just read about previously. It does all this and still pushes the larger story of the MCU forward.Michael B. Jordan plays the rare villain in that you can almost relate to him, except he lacks any nobility in his actions. Andy Serkis steals all his scenes as a psycho bad guy you can't take your eyes off of. Danai Gurira as Okoye shows the world just how bad-ass us Walking Dead fans have known her to be for awhile now. Seriously, she's impressive. Letitia Wright as Shuri was another personal delight, such a fun character, great casting.Chadwick Boseman occupies the role of T'Challa/Black Panther with so much grace, strength, passion and just plain old aristocratic grandiosity effortlessly oozing from his very center...that it would seem practically impossible to consider a recast for future Black Panther movies. He was perfect and it's still hard to believe he's gone.Whatever happens in the future, we'll always have this movie to watch and enjoy.Wakanda forever, rest in peace, dear king. üëëüíîüê±"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,7/10,"It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less...well...stupid!Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects."
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2018,4/10,"It's easier to bear with the start of the movie, because that's where you get the origin of the Black Panther, the cultural values and the James Bond style accessories, but it continues at a snails pace with very little humour.I expected this film to have at least been 'watchable' but this is my second movie to have been walked out on in the cinema.Reminders of many other films, perhaps I missed the best bits? I made over an hour!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2020,8/10,"I don't hate the level of jokes and jokes in Marvel movies, but I also hope that Marvel Pictures can make bolder breakthroughs and attempts. Finally, they produced a unique and mature work called ""Black Panther"", which made me very happy and pleased for five years. If you can encourage white people 's movies to get good reviews and recognition, why must encourage black people 's works to be rejected by the words ""political correctness""?"
BLACK PANTHER,30 May 2018,7/10,"There's no denying 2018's Marvel universe entry 'Black Panther' made a major statement and had a monumental impact on society. The first film to follow the story of a black superhero struck a chord with audiences not only because it of its historical qualities, but because it was an entertaining, fresh action-adventure ride that breathed new life into the aging franchise.At its core, 'Panther' follows a traditional hero narrative, following a somewhat unassuming leader from his rise to power to his fall from from grace and a nearly unsurmountable pathway to return to his position. We've seen this time after time in stories like 'The Lion King,' what makes it also work here is the fact that it has the ""Marvel touch"" - a great cast, good special effects, enough humor to keep audiences laughing and tons of formulaic yet expected stylized fight scenes.While audiences first got to know T'Challa and Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) in 'Captain America: Civil War,' it's clear he was ready to step into the spotlight. T'Challa is likable thanks to his serious yet cool outlook and commitment to the people of his homeland, Wakanda, and the people he surrounds himself with are a great foil. From his feisty younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) to his love interest Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), he is in great company. Even those who are no fans of his, like outsider Eric Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) or frenemy W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) are effective in their roles. But the cast is nearly an endless sea of familiar, successful actors, from Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett to Sterling K. Brown and Martin Freeman.But acting is just a portion of why 'Panther' succeeds. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the fact that it does not take itself too seriously. Don't get me wrong - this is no 'Deadpool' in the comedy department - but it strikes a near-perfect balance of sweet and salty. Also, the juxtaposition between poverty-stricken Oakland, CA, USA with the prosperous, hi-tech Wakanda, Africa does not go unnoticed. The natural beauty of the African setting is another element that helps set 'Panther' apart from other similar films.Sure, it's understandable why some may say this film is a bit overrated, given the somewhat unoriginal plot. But the plot is not usually the reason you go to see movies like this. It's all about the entertainment value, and 'Black Panther' delivers on this front."

BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,10/10,Black Panther is a masterpiece. This is truly the best marvel movie ever. It was so good that I saw it twice
BLACK PANTHER,10 September 2020,8/10,A simply outstanding film. The story of the film is great. The screenplay is also good. The direction of the film is good. The performances of the cast especially Chadwick Boseman R.I.P. is terrific. The CGI and visual effects are terrific. Definitely worth a watch for all superhero movie lovers. If not then watch it for Chadwick Boseman.
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,8/10,"This review of Black Panther is spoiler free**** (4/5)WITH ONLY A few films to his name director Ryan Coogler has taken a real turn in the world of cinema, first was tough-bearing directorial debut Fruitvale Station which was only a small indie project but after that it didn't take long for his name to be on the map, it was, inevitably a few years later when he made his second feature Creed (Rocky 7) where the illigitimate son of the late Apollo Creed would take his turn in the boxing world, and finally his third and latest film Black Panther is his chance at a big budget feature. However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite. With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza."
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2020,7/10,"Of course this is a popcorn movie, like all the rest in the marvel universe. Has a lot of good action scenes, good fights, it is a very entertaining movie."
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2021,,This is probably more of Marvel's most unique films. Well you could see the centre themes and ideas were based around African heritage and some political themes.Alright story with some flaws. Characters are poor except for the Black Panther. And very good CGI and music. There isn't any particular meaning to it also. Every motive and half the lines the charctars had something to do was with black themes which was unoriginal and uncreative.For me honestly it wasn't that interesting.Memorable: No Rewatchable:No.
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2018,6/10,"The movie was as advertised; about the Black Panther, sort of.Long story short Black Panther is King, but son of his dead Uncle wants the throne and wants to put weapons in the Black community, because victims?Essentially that is the plot. The movie is better than Age of Ultron, GOTG2, and probably the same way I view Civil War in terms of score.The problem is the music was terrible, the CGI was blatant, and the movie lacked beautiful women. Believe it or not, bald women are not beautiful. Where were the models and thick women and so on. This felt like a feminist, SJW wet dream.The message was whites are bad and Blacks are victims. Blacks have lost, not because of low IQ or lack of ability, but the man. What a terrible message.The movie is basically egging on Blacks to commit crimes in a false belief that Wakanda is a real place and if you cannot find it, it is because the man took it from you.The movie besides poor music and lacking beauty, it was missing a transition. One moment someone is fighting, the next sad. One moment a character has motivation then it magically disappears. Why was the Black Panther saved? Why was the King betrayed? Why, why why?Of course, all the men must be femsplained and talked down to. This is a terrible movie in terms of ideology, terrible for men as it makes men seems weak while empowering women to talk down to them.If a man slaps a lion, the lion kills. If a woman slaps a man...............This movie is not great, but not awful or bad. It's a 5 to a 6. It missed potential.I recommend you watch as a popcorn flick but never claim it was good...it is enjoyable, but multiple viewings will lead to the same results...it's not that good."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,6/10,"""Best Marvel movie ever""...Really?
It looked like an Avatar/Skyfall rip-off and everything was predictable thanks to the trailer! Review: Now with Black Panther, I thought the trailer was great, so I went hoping for something better. It gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up. 3D (Beyond the screen) technology appears to be very lacking for fast attractive action fighting sequences.
The theme was seen in M:I-4 and Skyfall, where Team Black Panther have to hide and use their brains. 
The biggest fault found in Black Panther is that it does not address the whereabouts of hero origins or where we are in terms of following. Unobtanium is the valuable mineral in Avatar while vibranium is the material in Black Panther.
And 97% rating? Sheesh!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,4/10,"DISCLAIMER: Before you read my review, I want to ensure all of you that I am 100% not racist. I don't like this movie, it has absolutely nothing to do with the race and culture. I love the superhero Black Panther, and I enjoy the African people and learning about their culture. This movie does establish the sets/Locations, and special effects well, but nothing else. Any way, back to Black Panther. When I first found out he was joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe I got excited. Black Panther was great in ""Captain America: Civil War"", and Chadwick Boseman is a perfect actor to play this role. Then came the solo movie ""Black Panther"", and..... Well, just read my review below.""Black Panther"" (2018), there has been a lot of hype surrounding this ""movie"", even before the first trailer was released! Many Marvel fans had a lot of hope and expectations, was it worth the hype to me? To be quite honest, no. I was very disappointed with this ""movie"". Why? The ""movie"" is an overall dull and boring experience from beginning to end. I kept checking my watch to see how much time was left, and I also fell asleep numerous times! I almost walked out of the theater. But, this is not the first Marvel movie that I've absolutely hated. There are other Marvel movies, along with some other different films not related to Marvel where I almost walked out of the theater. However there are positives for this ""movie"", but very few. (I ALWAYS TRY TO SALVAGE ANY POSITIVES OUT OF ANY MOVIE I SEE.) First off, the special effects are first-rate of course, Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, and a perfect choice for the Black Panther character. But, I think Black Panther works better as side character, or a team player in other movies. Also, the sets and locations in the ""film"" gave it an interesting atmosphere. But sadly, those variables did not help the ""movie"". I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating on my personal scale. On IMDB, every two stars count as 1 star on my scale. So, that means it gets a 4 out of 10 on the IMDB scale. Unless you're a fan of the Marvel films, I suggest skipping this ""movie"" and saving your money. I am kind of happy I saw it though, I just don't think I'll be seeing it again."
BLACK PANTHER,17 June 2021,9/10,"I have already made the mistake of writing a long and detailed review on Aquaman, Thor: Ragnarok and Wonder Woman, with all of them being marked Unhelpful. That's why I remembered to check the reviews over here, and the same bashing is happening here also. That's why I think I should explain and warn you first before you make the same mistake. Tell me, what exact part of this review are you finding unhelpful? Am I not explaining something important? Am I missing some detail? Is my English bad? What is it that you want to mark my review unhelpful for? If you didn't like the movie, that's your personal choice. If you mark a review unhelpful it means the review didn't help you understand what the movie is about. I will do my best to explain it to you in a spoiler free format, and if you still mark my review unhelpful I will raise my rating to 9, not because I am some toxic fan (otherwise I'd have given it a 10) but rather to rub salt on your wounds. With all that said, let's move on to the review.Edit: So someone still marked my review unhelpful even after all this. Here, I have done it. I can imagine his mother must be moaning right now.So before the release of Avengers: Infinity War, I had never watched any of the MCU movies before. It was only after the release of that movie that I saw everyone talking about it all the time, and that I had to watch all the movies before I could start watching IW. I had to watch all the movies so that I could catch up in time before Endgame. I had heard a little bit about some random guy named Black Panther getting snapped out by Thanos, but I really didn't care because I had never even heard about this guy my whole life. So after all the movies I had watched, Black Panther was next. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie because it seemed so much culturally different, but I thought that if I had watched Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man without having known anything about them before, so I can do the same here also.The first thing that strikes differently about this movie is that this is not exactly a character origin story. Black Panther was already previously introduced in Captain America: Civil War where his father had died, but he was never explained as to why or how he's the superhero. This is the movie which finally explains that part. The world thinks Wakanda is a poor country while in reality it is a powerhouse of vibranium. T'Challa is a leader and the saviour of the people. The king of Wakanda gets to be the Black Panther, for which they have to take the heart shaped herb that helps them acquire knowledge from all the previous Black Panthers.Other than the superhero himself, N'Jadaka ie Killmonger believes he is the rightful ruler of the kingdom, because of which he challenges T'Challa. From Killmonger's point of view he should be the king because he wants to take revenge fromT'Challa's father T'Chaka for killing his father. The movie spends a good deal over it, such that it allows the viewer to sympathise with him, even though his actions are clearly wrong. Finally N'Jadaka beats T'Challa in the ceremonial fight which allows him to be the Black Panther instead. There are multiple moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists, as to whether let their kingdom be governed by someone who lets his emotions get the better of him or dare to overthrow their own king.The moral dilemma is actually a very important point in the story, since in the scene where T'Challa, Shuri and Okoye are talking about this, Okoye says it's her duty to serve whoever sits on the throne no matter how the person is. That is a stark contrast from both T'Challa and N'Jadaka, since both of them see beyond their rules to see whom and what to fight for. The Wolf Tribe led by M'Baku is ready to help Black Panther, in spite of having previously faced a humiliating defeat by T'Challa in the Black Panther ceremony. While T'Challa makes allies along the way, N'Jadaka eliminates his allies.Although the CGI was a bit off in some places, overall it was good. Since I had no idea what I was heading for, I didn't expect to see a Wakanda having such a high technology (I didn't watch any trailer before watching the movie or read any comics). The fight scenes were also pretty fun to watch, except for the Busan one. I didn't like it for some reason which I myself don't know. The acting was also very good. This movie absolutely deserved the Oscar for the costume design. I think it has the best interpretation of the suit as depticted in the comics (only Iron Man comes a close second since it's not as comicbook accurate).Although this movie is not one of my favourites, it did leave some huge impacts on me. First of all, I have purchased almost all Black Panther comics. Secondly I have become a lot more open to watching movies from Africa, since now I won't be afraid of not understanding anything. And thirdly, it's something I will always remember Chadwick Boseman for. Rest in peace hero, you did a pretty great job."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself. It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them. Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music. Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challa's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored."

BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther in my opinion, is the most unique and different Marvel movie made so far. Many Marvel movies are copy and pastes of each other, and yes this movie does have some elements that were copied from other Marvel movies, but Black Panther made it its own thing. This movie has unique characters and a unique setting. Black Panther does have some issues though, like the overkill comedy and the iffy CGI. Although there are few issues with the movie, all of the issues are very noticeable and are not easy to ignore. Some scenes the CGI was very noticeable. There was just too much CGI used, I would like a little more practical effects. The comedy was just too much, I don't want Marvel to keep putting this type of comedy in their movies. A little comedy is good, but too much can ruin a movie.Story: 9/10There was only one problem with the story, but everything else was on point. The climax was weak in my opinion. There was so much hype in the movie for the climax, but the climax was disappointing. When the climax happened, the CGI was very noticeable and looked fake at times, and when T'Challa and Killmonger fought, all I saw was CGI. There was no pacing issues, which was shocking, because the movie is over 2 hours long. There was some bits that made me yawn, but the movie quickly got to the action before it got a little too boring. Wakanda is the setting of the movie, and I'm happy the way it turned out. Wakanda has a very futuristic style, which makes it a good and unique setting. I like what's at risk in the movie. Some movies give that ""Save the world, it depends on you"", but this movie doesn't fall for that. If T'Challa doesn't stop Killmonger, then the world could be at risk, due to the rare ore Wakanda has that can change the world, because of how powerful it is. Killmonger's plan is to share the ore and basically expose Wakanda, which could lead to a giant war that can end humanity on Earth. Overall, the story is strong, with real stakes at risk and great pacing, but a horrible climax.Characters: 10/10The antagonist, Killmonger is a very strong character. Killmonger has realistic and emotional motives, which really isn't evil motives, but at the same time, it could end the world. Many villains in movies are bad guys because they're evil, but the villain Killmonger doesn't have that common issue. T'Challa is another good character. He's a diverse character, not only suffering from Killmonger, but the guilt of his father's death. The supporting cast is well done. Each actor/actress did a great job on their character. The acting was also great, Michael B. Jordan stole the show for me, even though he was barely in the movie. Michael B. Jordan made his character (Killmonger) a believable antagonist, by showing a dark and a light side of Killmonger, which in my opinion makes a good villain. Overall, all the characters had their own role in the movie. The protagonist and the antagonist have their own inner conflict, which makes them diverse characters.Action: 7/10The action was the weakest part of Black Panther. Both the CGI and comedy affected the movie negatively. The CGI was iffy at some parts, for example the climax. The climax was a mess, in my opinion. The CGI wasn't bad, but from a Marvel movie, I expected more. The comedy was just overkill to me, although some parts were funny and made me laugh, but it's just too much. I think Marvel is too focused on comedy at the moment. The visual effects were really well done though. I liked the visuals and the colors used. Black Panther is on the same level as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is a high level to set. Overall, Black Panther had a variety of colors and visuals that made Black Panther look amazing, but in some instances, the CGI looks very bad for a Marvel movie, and the comedy was just a little too much.Black Panther was overall a good movie. There was some issues that really lowered the score for me, but with great directing and awesome action scenes, like at the beginning. This movie does everything right, to the characters and to the story. If Black Panther had a little more time to fix things up and look at the script, then Black Panther could've got a 10/10 from me. Black Panther earns it's place as a good Marvel movie. I recommend Black Panther to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, then Black Panther would be a good option."

All in all, the most exotic entry into the gigantic Marvel Cinematic Universe exclaims a powerful battle cry that announces probably one of the most important films of the franchise of superhero films, as it finally establishes a hero that properly represents the black community and gives them someone who they can look up to, but regardless of the enormous social significance, it sadly suffers from a formulaic, predictable and mediocre story that doesn't add anything to the genre or is worth being called outstanding or innovative, and neither did it deserve any of its Academy Award nominations. After hearing about the devastating news about the passing of Chadwick Boseman, my best friend and I decided to honour the influential actor by watching the first solo adventure of the comic book character he made come to life. To me it was a first-time watch, and I only have heard about the usual things, such as the surprising Oscar nominations. As already mentioned above, I can see the importance of this film as form of social statement, but as a film itself, I wouldn't call it outstanding. It is the usual MCU quality, and that is not a terrible thing at all. It just isn't as outstanding as it is made out to be. One of the greatest factors is undoubtedly the film's stylish blend of the African wilderness and futuristic environment, as it just looks great and creates the atmosphere in the first place. Also, the idea of the different tribes in the same country was somewhat fascinating, but other than that it suffers from the typical comic book film flaws. In a story that shares a striking resemblance with the second outing of the ""Iron Man"" films, villain Erik Killmonger is both interesting yet predictable and his potential not fully realised. Aside from the fact that he was more right than wrong, he was too underused and wasted in terms of what he could have been. In the end, the film assembled a decent cast (of which no one really acts outstandingly, though) and became a production that is more eminent as a political statement, rather than as a cinematic achievement. The nominations for the technical categories might have been deserved (well, at least it wasn't nominated for the CGI, cause that was terrible PS2 game quality at its best), but the nomination for Best Picture is nothing short of an insult to comic book adaptations that haven't received this recognition but were tremendously better than this (""The Dark Knight"", ""Logan"", to name a few). I don't want to say that it was a terrible film at all, quite the contrary. It is the usual dose of Marvel fun. Black Panther has already become a necessary icon. I just don't think that it is the remarkable cinematic achievement it is treated as. Nevertheless, I hope you are going to rest in power, King T'Challa."
BLACK PANTHER,11 November 2018,9/10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows that heroes can be black and women which is a really big accomplishment. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. The cinematography is absolutely magnificent it makes Wakanda feel like it is actually an African country. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
BLACK PANTHER,20 December 2018,2/10,"This is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. Maybe my expectations were way too high going into it. The effects and acting were OK but it was way too long, very boring, and had a stupid story that seemed like it was written by a child. Nothing surprising, interesting or funny. Very basic."
BLACK PANTHER,12 November 2018,3/10,"Two main aspects of this film are below average. Those being acting and storyline. However, what hurts this movie the most is the rave reviews it received across the board. These reviews are clearly unwarranted. Whilst watching the film you are constantly waiting for it to dramatically improve, only to be disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2019,6/10,"Ryan Coogler enters the MCU with flying colors: The final speech at the United Nations should be shown everywhere, around the world, for everybody to learn from it and realize that we are all Human brothers and sisters before being anything else. Black Panther teaches us how important it is not to have our heart full of hatred, and that the purpose of our lives is to discover and share, not to wage war and conquer."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,8/10,"'Black Panther' is another solid Marvel film, but thankfully works as a standalone action film and family drama. T'Challa (Boseman) - first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' - becomes King of Wakanda (a fictional African country) and has to deal with the dual responsibilities of following traditions, keeping his family and country safe and being the Black Panther (basically Batman - rich guy who can fight good and has a good suit and gadgets). There's a really great support cast - Killmonger (Jordon) as the long-lost cousin, Nakia (Nyong'o) as the ex-girlfriend/conscience, Okoye (Gurira) as his General, Ross (Freeman) as the CIA agent, Klaue (Serkis) as the mercenary, Zuri (Whitaker) as the shaman, Shuri (Wright) as his sister, Ramonda (Bassett) as his mum and W'Kabi (Kaluuya) as his best friend. However, Boseman really carries the film, with a lot of poise and calmness, but then extreme passion when needed. The plot's not too complicated and has an obvious ending, but the 2 & a quarter hours are well worth it.There's plenty of stunning CGI (probably too much, since none of the film was actually shot in Africa, a big shame - feels like if they filmed in South Korea, they could go to Kenya or Zimbabwe for a few real-life shots), a good tribal-drum score, some great action scenes and plenty of hand-to-hand combat scenes too. However, at it's heart is a good story of responsibility and doing what's right over what's easy or the usual way."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,6/10,"People seem to like this because they say first mostly black film etc. But no blackbfilms been around for decades and mostly always have a white geezer following behind
As in this
It's mr freeman's turn and it seems we're sort on us actors as he was supposed to be a American
Y not just keep him British or even get someone else. But then I remembered I think marvel have used most American actors alreadyI def expected more action only action last around ten min in Korea 
Go watch Andy lau films better action in South Korea all thru 
To me people just scared of saying don't like it
I'm not
Reminds me when I was in USA when avatar came out everyone goin on how grt it was I walked out of cinema thinking what a waste of three hrs and never watched again how he conned studios to make 2-3-4 lol
Well it's like this with marvel we all like comic book movies but getting to many I mean pt 1-2-3 etc y not do Thor 4 hrs or avengers 4 hrs with break in between like yrs back Bollywood do. But no BECAUSE they want us lot to listen to PAID reviewers and press and waste our money it's s scam tbh needs stopping rt IMDb all dodgy scores but get away with it
I for one would welcome a independent review
Most press screenings they get Little keep sakes now I wonder what's in them I really do
But watch enjoy but don't expect to much if u like it grt if you don't its grt again"
BLACK PANTHER,20 July 2018,8/10,"I'd heard so much about this film though I had only heard about Black Panther from a comic book encyclopedia. But this movie delivers. There's one scene that looks like it was lifted from James Bond 007 and the plot is reminiscent of Disney's The Lion King but it's more than just that. It's the story of a young king and his greatest challenge against a jealous enemy. This really sets up the story for Avengers: Infinity War (which I have yet to see, along with Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two). I liked how the casting went, with mostly African-Americans as the main characters and one Brit named Martin Freeman (from the Hobbit movies). The visuals were really good and the characters were well done. It makes me want to learn more about my favorite continent (besides North America)."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2020,7/10,"Almost all black actors, this is the biggest feature. There is no regular white or white superhero, the audience has a delay in acceptance, and the panther's superpowers are not very strong.The contrast between extreme intelligence and backwardness, a sharp contrast between modern technology and indigenous primitives, but they blend together very well, without surprise, the ending is as expected, the superhero wonAfrican symbols and human relationships. The ancient tribal clan, inherited from the throne, various African cultural characteristics are obvious, and the local customs are also out of the tray. Africa also has heroes and needs heroes"
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2021,4/10,"I will never understand what is so good about this movie. It's not terrible but there is nothing original nor particularly well made to justify the good ratings. I enjoyed the action scenes in Korea, but that was pretty much it. The plot is convoluted, none of the characters is interesting, Wakanda is visually gorgeous but CGI gets way too cartoonish during some parts, including the lackluster final fight. Can't see any cultural value either, am I missing something? Too bad because I actually enjoyed Black Panther's first appearance in Civil War."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,5/10,"Watching this film I sometimes felt that the people who made it had done so just to annoy me.
I am a white 57 year old male,British,I usually enjoy Marvel and DC films but this one did not do much for me.
I give no spoilers but the plot is so insane that I considered walking out halfway through,despite having paid a painful 12 pounds to see it.I am surprised there has not been an outcry about this film and the way it shows an admittedly fictional African country.
As a film it works ok if you ignore the crazy plot and accents"
BLACK PANTHER,16 October 2018,7/10,Certainly not as good as hype would suggest it might be.Decent enough flick though long as you leave your reality senses at the box office Some strange casting especially Martin Freeman though Danai Gurira was good
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,3/10,"Oh yes, this review has spoilers. 1. Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke do an amazing job in the movie; Chadwick Boseman is way too boring and terrible of an actor to be a leader. Michael B. Jordan completely fails as an actor here. He needs a Razzie for this performance. The rest of the cast are simply contrived or phoning it in for an easy paycheck. Andy Serkis did seem to enjoy his role. It felt like a waste when he was killed off.
2. Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is the worst villain ever in the Marvel universe. Jordan approaches the character, who is supposed to be a genius, like an NFL defensive end that is on steroids, which makes it very hard to take him seriously. He was smart enough to graduate from the Naval College at 19 and go to MIT for grad school but opts to become a SEAL who kills hundreds of people? Right. Worse yet, Killmonger also appears the be the only character in the history of Wakanda that has any sort of common sense. Aren't you not supposed to sympathize with the bad guy?
3. The whole premise of the country of Wakanda is an insult to Africans and black people in general. Instead of basing Wakanda on your average African country, it is portrayed as being like a futuristic Shanghai with tech that is decades, if not centuries advanced. How in the world has no one left Wakanda and told the world about what is there? How has it been kept a secret? Why haven't they conquered the world? Killmonger is the only leader of Wakanda that has figured out what the country is capable of! Once again, that takes you completely out of the movie. How can a society be so advanced but yet not understand how powerful it is?
4. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation of Earth but everyone still dresses and acts like primitive tribal people and even determine their leadership through individual combat. Despite being advanced, T'Challa's bodyguards use spears and call guns primitive. Seriously?
5. M'baku, the leader of the Jabari tribe, wants to be the Black Panther very badly and hates every other tribe, but when presented with the chance to ingest the flower that will give him the Black Panther's strength and kill off T'Challa, opts to help him recover instead and take back his throne. Predictably of course, he claims to not want to help T'Challa at first, only to show up during the battle. Surprise! Not really.
6. On the topic of predictability, as soon as you see Daniel Kaluuya's character, you know he's going to be the friend that stabs T'Challa in the back.
7. They tried too hard to push Shuri as a lovable Q like character, but she was never convincing at all. If anything, she was beyond annoying.
8. Black Panther's father, as Black Panther, commits an unsolved black on black murder in a project in Oakland in 1992. I am not making this up.
9. T'Challa comes to Oakland in the present day, shows some kids his futuristic jet, who then gawk and start discussing how they will steal it, strip it down and sell the parts. Once again, not making this up. Wasn't this supposed to be a positive film for black people that didn't reinforce negative stereotypes of them?10, 20 years ago, movies like this would have been nominated for a Razzie. Now, they are getting near perfect scores on Rotten Tomatoes and under consideration for Oscars. I'm just not buying it. This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. I could go into detail but I just can't remember everything. You've been warned."
BLACK PANTHER,6 December 2019,1/10,"Horrible in every way possible, directing, cast, plot. You name a category and it stinks"
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2020,1/10,"I don't know what kind of world the people involved in this movie live in, but this movie and every other modern superhero movie is just super ego mania. Psychotics on a cocaine trip, and nothing else.Panicking, acting tough. Dreaming on or worshipping violence. These are all the things bad guys do. There's no sociable good guys in the film. You're just putting up with maniacs."
BLACK PANTHER,8 February 2020,10/10,This movie is once again proof that the Marvel movies aren't just a huge-budget superhero CGI juggernaut. The way it depicted indignation at the oppression of blacks in this country and how T'chala handled it was perfect.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"19 February 2018
Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise. Once again people.......don't leave before the end of the credits.....two extras this time!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 July 2021,6/10,"Pretty good ""Lion King"" type of story, with a cousin (Killmonger) instead of an uncle.Boseman was good, but the writing for the character of Black Panther was better in other Marvel movies.Tough to rewatch because of all of the quasi political garbage stuffed into the script.The character of Shuri was more irritating than entertaining, but overall it was decent."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2020,9/10,"This movie was awesome! Black Panther was one of my favorite parts of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" and this film shows why. This is ""Batman"" meets ""James Bond."" One review I read complained that the film didn't have enough action. I disagree. It had just the right amount. A film doesn't need action every scene to be good, it just needs a good story, and this film delivers. This film gives us the best MCU villain since Loki. He's one of the few villains that I can sympathize with. I'm not justifying his actions, but I get where he's coming from. The technology in this film is really cool. There's one scene in particular that I won't spoil but I thought it would make a great ride at EPCOT. The last 30 minutes alone were worth the price of admission. The final battle is so good and really drew me in! The dialogue is also very well written. This is one of the best films of the MCU. And it's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. Period.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2018,7/10,"I have been having a hard time with my own review system, just my own opinion of movies. It's not because I don't like something but when compared to garbage something that isn't garbage seems good. Having said that I am not sure where all the hate comes from for this movie, so many 1's and 2's in the reviews. It's no masterpiece but it was more fun to watch than Ant Man and I would give Ant Man a solid 6, hell I hated Iron Fist and I would give that a 5. Compared to those this movie is a 7 for me. Compared to some of the greatest movies of all time, maybe a high 5 low 6, but not close to a 1 or 2.Awesome graphics for the most part - humans jumping around are hard and I watch it on an older LCD 55"" so some of the shots/transitions are messed up/blurry for me, this seems to happen with a lot of the bigger CGI scenes (not just this movie for me). The acting was ok, I liked the 2 main characters they seemed real and flushed out enough. I thought Jordan's acting was a little under whelming but still ok. No one stood out as a stinker.The story was very mediocre - you could have bet money on the outcome after hearing they were going to make this movie... or any Marvel movie that is. Good guy vs bad guy - guess what happens. But the backdrop and the way they present the movie saves the day in my books. The fight scenes could have used less CGI but other than that it was an entertaining flick."
BLACK PANTHER,20 May 2018,5/10,"A Black Panther movie was inevitable, after the appearance of this titular hero in a Cap. America movie. Chadwick Boseman breathes life in a charismatic way, into this character who brings class in the MCU, being a hero, but also a king of the beautiful country of Wakanda. These are the only redeeming qualities of this movie that is otherwise a stinker and shows that the MCU has more failures than just Incredible Hulk and Inhumans.Black Panther is about T'Challa who takes the mantle as a king, unites various tribes, hides from the world and comes to oppose a villain in Killraven, who wants to expose Wakanda to the world, and use vibranium as revenge for years of oppression and abuse against his ancestors. T'Challa has to face this challenge and make peace with his own ancestor's mistakes at the same time.I can't see how this movie has high ratings. Besides Boseman and Freeman, there is not a single decent actor in this movie. The acting is horrible. Andy Serkis is trying, but his overacting gets annoying after a few minutes. Michael B. Jordan has showed the worst of acting in Creed and FF, and repeats this here, unable to convince the viewer of his nature and motivations. Other characters were random and rushed, so they couldn't fill the holes. Because of this, the movie never engages, making this feel slow from the beginning to the end.The effects were slightly entertaining but also over-used. The suit is never interesting, the way they did with Iron Man. Vibranium is rich and interesting, but never treated with the respect it deserves. And the action is so random, fast and CGI heavy, that it never convinces or entertains. It just confuses and makes this movie feel rushed. The mixing of slow-paced and fast-paced makes the movie feel uninteresting and unbalanced.Wakanda is as beautiful as a fairytale brought to life. But that can't save the other mistakes that turn this movie into a stinker."
BLACK PANTHER,27 July 2021,5/10,"...thought it was poorly made.Having a huge, rich and secret city was very unbelievable, even in the superhero world. Made no economic sense.Opened with Black Panther stopping several trucks with EMP devices. But later, we have a very good-looking car chase when they had devices that would have made that car chase not possible. Nevermind that if someone was in one of those invisible airplanes, it would never have happened either.And this was a very advanced society---that still solved their disputes with violent combat.Andy Serkis was very entertaining as the bad guy.Although I'm a rabid liberal, I guess my previous review was not accepted as I included questioning its storyline vs its legitimate intent. Very contradictory, as I saw it."
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,4/10,"I'm still puzzled at the amazing Box Office success of ""Black Panther"". I was looking forward to watching this movie as soon as it came out on Blu-ray. Finally, last weekend me and my family watched it. The veredict? Very nice eye candy but I never felt ANYTHING for ANY of the characters on the screen. The only one who had some sort of ""life"" was Andy Serkis character, but he was gone way too early. The plot is contrived at best, something 13 year old kids will definitely have trouble with. It was nice seeing Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead) in a prominent role, although she basically apes what she does in TWD.
Halfway through the movie I fell asleep, literally, just waking up some 20 odd minutes before the end.
Either I'm becoming too old (which is a fact) or movies of this nature are becoming a bore. I'd like to thing it's the second, cause I enjoy mostly sci-fi/fantasy/horror fare over any other genre. Plus, I still enjoy kids movies like ""Coco"" or ""Ferdinand"" very much. I think there's been an over saturation of things Marvel in recent years, even more so than Star Wars stuff. To top it all, comic wise, I don't recall ever hearing of a hero named ""Black Panther"", unlike Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk or Spider-man.One thing's for sure. The FX are marvelous and so is the sound mix, so this is the perfect movie to show off your new home theater system. Other than that, stay clear off this one!"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"I saw it last night with a fellow comic book nerd in a theater with about 30 folks. Unfortunately, 20 of them were little kids who came on a church bus and talked loudly through the whole movie. The plot was solid and the action was great. The CGI was pretty bad in a few places, (a missing arm that you can kind of see). We liked the tech and there were a couple of laughs. The bad guy was believable with motivation that was on track. There was a romance that played well. Overall a great effort from Marvel. The politics kept us away and when I said it was 4/5 stars on FB it only took a few minutes before someone called me racist. Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement. If you like a movie because it has a woman you are sexist just as if you dislike a movie because it has a woman. Same thing here with race. Race did not play into my enjoyment of the film. It was good. It wasn't in my top 5 superhero movies. Maybe my top 10. I'd recommend it. One of the best things about it is they kept it PG13, no cussing or nudity or over the top violence. I really liked that."
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2019,8/10,"T'Challa (also known as the Black Panther) returns to his homeland after the lose of his father (as we saw in Captain America - Civil War). T'Challa accepts the crown and becomes king of Wakanda, but his position is soon challenged by a new threat.Unlike the previous Marvel instalments, our lead hero is more of a silent type who rarely speaks, but when he does, he's confident and strong. The film also has a heavier focus on story and developing its new characters rather than loading the film up with huge amounts of witty jokes as we've previously in the likes of Thor Ragnarok or Iron Man. The film also has less amount of action than I expected for a Marvel title. But is less humour and action something to be spoken about as a negative or positive?Being a Marvel film, one element that doesn't surprise me is that once again we have an audio track which is loud and alive. I personally love how Black Panther's soundtrack felt- perfectly timed and fitting tightly with every moment. Even the faint drumming in the background of some scenes was tension building and gave life to moments where key characters dealt with dramatic situations. The visuals are also strong, full of colour, except for some of the film's fights scenes, and this brings me to one of the film's negatives for me personally.Some the fights scenes are fast and quick, which I expected for someone who moves and fights like a Panther. But, some of these action scenes were nearly in utter darkness and I found it slightly disappointing. Some of the action scenes were so dark it became somewhat unreal, almost turning it into an animation film and it became harder to enjoy the action as the darkness felt slight distracting. Other action sequence resulted in predictable outcomes even before the claws come out. The villains (yes, plural) overall were also fun and some of the best we've seen in the Marvel universe to date (Andy Serkis- dare I say no more lol).Overall, this is yet again another enjoyable Marvel film. I love how this film manages to be different from the other previous instalments. We have a new entry to the Marvel universe which focuses more on creating better characters and a strong plot rather than pushing witty characters and big bang action sequences. I truly give absolute respect to the results that have been achieved here. While it might not be my no.1 Marvel film to date, I can easily understand why many Marvel fans will sing and chant its praises.8.1/10

BLACK PANTHER,8 October 2020,8/10,"Hmmm....not so sure why there are so many negative reviews of this film. Some people just don't know a good film when they see it, the bad reviews are completely unjust. My brother sat me down and forced me to watch this yesterday, knowing that I am not a fan of superhero movies...yet I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Great cast, well acted especially by Leticia Wright and Danai Gurira. It was funny when it needed to be, fantastic storyline. What was not to like?
A really enjoyable watch...coming from someone who usually dislikes superhero films!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,5 November 2018,7/10,"I thought i wasn't going to like the movie because i wasn't too keen on watching an African superhero, but i actually enjoyed the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"When the movie started It was boring and indifferent in first 40 minutes or so and I wondered why it grossed so much money and had positive reviews.
 excluding the scene in which the new king was crowned in the beginning of the movie the rest were not memorable stuff unless u were fanatic about African culture.
 thank god the movie was fixed at some point when it was revealed that the main villain was not the one the movie presented at first but another dude who had connections with the king...etc........(will not spoil it). then the movie became interesting and had strong scenes following the way DC make it's superhero films. the movie had twists and in the end it will leave you wanting more. if it was not for first 40-50 minutes it would be great but now it only gets a grade between B- and B cause of the first half which was a low C-. remember there is an extra scene after first movie credits roll and then there is a second scene after all credits roll. in the likes of the wonder woman if u like DC movies u will like this especially if u are in to African culture and stuff."
BLACK PANTHER,28 August 2020,10/10,"One of my favourite marvel films, excellent story which is different to the rest. Excellent cast and Michael B Jordan plays an excellent villain. Can't rave about this film enough."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,5/10,"Of course, ""this Bond"" has some weird kind-of-super-powers and the ""Vibranium"" metal has some very weird characteristics (it can heal? A metal that heals? Really?!). It doesn't make any sense. I mean, much, much more so than other Marvel stuff (say, Iron Man).But, it takes itself way too seriously for a Bond movie. It does try at times, but there's at most one attempt at humor and at most one attempt at ""being cute"" (i.e. Black Panther's sister) that work.There's a lot of politics here, mostly anti-Trump, but also some ""late-to-the-show"" Hillary feminism, but I don't care for such things, one way or the other - there are talk shows for such things.Frankly, it simply missed the mark. Black Panther was a Phantom rip-off, not James Bond. For whatever reason, they tried to make him into something he's not, and it shows. It's not only that, it's full of misses. They even manage to make Angela Basset not look like a powerful woman, but ""yet another mum"".In general, movie is decently done and it's watchable. It's just that there is not much to see in there."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2019,10/10,"There's been a lot of hype building up to the release of this movie, based on Black Panther's appearance in Captain America: Civil War and the anticipation of the first truly Black superhero movie. Well Black Panther doesn't just live up to the hype; it exceeds it. Black Panther is a wildly entertaining and often thoughtful blockbuster that brings one of Marvel's more obscure heroes mainstream.If you saw Civil War, you already know the basics. T'Challa is the Black Panther, prince of the wealthy, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. Following the death of his father, the time is at hand for his ascension to the throne. But of course the transition won't be smooth, with challengers to the throne and enemies both old and new threatening the kingdom.One of the best things about this movie is its incredibly talented ensemble cast. Chadwick Boseman gives an extremely well-rounded performance in the title role. He's smart, brave, frequently intense, by turns easygoing and dead serious, and always imbued with a deep sense of duty and honor. And no matter what, he always has style. As Black Panther, Boseman sets a new standard of black coolness just as Jamie Foxx did in Django Unchained and Will Smith in Men in Black.Of course he's not the only star to shine. At times Letitia Wright almost steals the show as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister and personal Q branch. She's delightfully irreverent and sassy, and does she ever have some great gadgets to share. Lupita Nyong'o also casts an imposing figure and is a delight to see in combat as general Nakia, head of the royal bodyguards. Martin Freeman makes a good comic relief everyman as the film's token (or should I say Tolkien) white guy. And Andy Serkis is typically unrecognizable and delightfully insane as the villainous Ulysses Klaue. Seriously, this guy's nuts.Michael B Jordan makes one of Marvel's best villains in recent years as Eric Killmonger. He's brilliant but uncultured, wisecracking but intensely angry, a kid from the streets with pretentions to rule an empire. And he is absolutely deadly. Jordan looks even more ripped here than he did in Creed, and he fights like Antonio Silva on steroids. And for all his ruthlessness and arrogance, he's not entirely unsympathetic. He's a man who's lost much and lived a hard life from an early age. He's driven by a desire to uplift the poor and oppressed, to help his people. It's just that for him that means igniting a global race war and seeking world domination.There are beautifully choreographed fight scenes and excellent special effects galore. The casino brawl and car chase are fast paced and adrenaline pumping, and the final battle atop the mountain is particularly magnificent, like Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. And visually the film is a real treat to behold. The costumes and set pieces are a whirl of colorfs, the camera work excellent, and the natural scenery is breathtaking. It's hard to believe this wasn't filmed in Africa.While this is a Hollywood blockbuster made with a largely American cast, Black Panther has a profoundly African flavor, from the music to the fashions to the traditional storytelling scene at the beginning. Wakanda's visual design is also unique and distinctive. It's extremely futuristic but at the same time deeply African and tribal, with hover-trains and holograms alongside spears, thatch huts and lines of robed dancers. It makes for a fascinating vision of a society that's progressed farther than practically any on earth while staying deeply attuned to its roots.The movie is also attuned to the culture and controversies right now. Let there be no misunderstandings: while there are subtle references to the Black Panther party, T'Challa is absolutely not a black militant or nationalist. The bad guy is. That said, it touches on poverty, drugs, mass incarceration and the sense of resentment its created. But it does so lightly, never in a preachy or confrontational way. Instead it's how T'Challa and Killmonger deal with these problems and the contrasting solutions they provide that drive the story.Black Panther is well-acted, well directed, action packed and gorgeously shot, it's a real treat for Marvel fans and anyone who likes action. And fanboys rejoice, they even included Man Ape, albeit without the gorilla suit. Yet another triumph for Marvel Studios. I give it four out of four armored war rhinos."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,7/10,"Overall, I pretty much liked this movie, altho I admit it is surely overrated. I believe that the reason why it is overrated is because of the fame and glory MCU gets nowadays, but still it is a movie that deserves respect, most of all because of all the different aspects the movie offers. The special effects are all over the movie and they are amazing, altho at some moments they were even to much for my taste. But I honestly expected a bit more from the story, since I had not read anything about the Black Panther from the Marvel comics before. At times, the movie took to long to progress, which made it boring at few points , as the movie is 2h and 15 min. long. I certainly enjoyed ""Bilbo"" and Daniel Kaluuya being in this movie which made my day, since I did not see the cast before I started watching the movie and I was positively surprised. 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2019,4/10,"It took me quite a while to watch this one, as I didn't feel it would add something of substance to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plus the fact that it was extremely over-hyped and I happen to dislike Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan's horrendous acting abilities. The filmmakers even misused Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman; to spoil two such great actors tells you something about this movie. I wasn't surprised, really; I expected this movie to be boring and unappealing to me. I tried to get pass all of those unfavourable things and just enjoy the film, because if it's at least silly entertainment with zero depth or interesting storytelling, then at least it accomplishes the entertainment factor, which is a good thing. Having said that, there were moments in which I found myself interested and involved, but those moments were few and faded away pretty quickly. Even the action I found it dull, nothing that could raise an eyebrow. The only thing I thought it was okay was the CGI, which I've seen a lot of people in here criticize. Whenever there were scenes of the tech used in Wakanda, I though the special effects were very well done.
I couldn't feel absolutely anything for these characters. Had they all died in the end, I wouldn't have been shocked or even cared at all. Michael B. Jordan as a villain was an utter joke, totally forced and unbelievable.I think Black Panther actually IS a cool character, but I dislike the way the actor has portrayed T'Challa, and to have a heavily criticized origin movie sort of creates an stigma for the character in my opinion. Although one could argue that it definitely has something to do with the masses and social media, because the hype was created by the people, the ""fans"". And fans disguised as ""journalists"" posting about the movie on every site and on social media. Believe it or not all of this influences how many people view this character and his universe.All in all, this movie wasn't very good in my opinion, but I did enjoy some parts, so I'm giving it a 5. There are far more people out there with harsher words than mine who won't hesitate in rating it below 5. If there's a sequel, I will be watching for sure, but I'm not expecting much, that's for sure. Suddenly I feel like watching Static Shock or Blade for better outlets of metahumans of African-descent. And to why there are so many people praising this flick as if it was The Dark Knight, it's beyond me."
BLACK PANTHER,6 August 2020,5/10,"I'm not a racist, but this movie is overrated. Its just another superhero movie, but with bad special effects. It's meh. Good for kids tho."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,4/10,"""Black Panther"" is just another, average superhero movie if we're being honest. It's been getting rave reviews, but in my opinion it is massively over-hyped. And no, I didn't go into this movie wanting to hate it. In fact, I was excited walking into the theatre. But after the first dimly lit, poorly shot action scene, I knew I was in for a wild ride into mediocrity.First of all, let's talk action because most people go see superhero movies for the high-octane action sequences. Literally every action sequence in this movie, except for maybe one, were awful. Why is that? Take the first action sequence that I mentioned above: it was so dimly lit and filled with shaky camera that the action was incomprehensible. And that was incredibly disappointing because it set the standard for what is to be expected, quality wise, when it came to the action, for the rest of the movie. Another big action scene that takes place in a type of underground South Korean casino had the same problem: shaky camera. Sure, the action is shown in a very clever one shot take that was cool to watch, but when the action can't be clearly seen because the camera is shaking and because the camera is too close up that the action is off-screen, the entire scene loses its entertainment factor. There is one action scene that I thought was exciting (it's towards the end and so you know exactly what scene I'm talking about, let's just say that it ends with someone being thrown off of a high place), but pretty much the only reason I thought it was exciting was because I really enjoyed one of the characters involved in the fight. And yes, it was better shot then the rest of the action scenes, but I've seen much better shot and more exciting action scenes in other Marvel films, like ""Winter Soldier,"" for example. And when an action film doesn't have good action, it's just disappointing.Also, the titular Black Panther was one of the blandest main characters I've ever seen. I didn't connect with him at all. Killmonger, on the other hand, I could connect with. For the most part his rationale made sense, and at one point I even thought, ""How is this guy the villain? He wants to do a good thing."" BUT THEN, FOR SOME REASON, Killmonger's actions as a villain take a completely different turn and it seems like he completely changed his mind and wanted to do something entirely different. Maybe I just didn't get what he wanted to do or maybe I didn't understand how he wanted to complete his goals, but it was super stupid because his original goal absolutely did not need to be completed in the way he was going about it. I mean, when you get down to it, what Killmonger wanted to do was noble; it was something no leader of Wakanda was willing to do, or wanted to do, in the past, so I was totally on board with him and honestly, I wanted him to win. In fact, I kind of think Killmonger was the hero of the film - he just went the wrong way in trying to accomplish what he wanted, but if he would've accomplished his goal, there is no doubt that the positive consequences would have far outweighed the negative.I really have not much else to say. This was just an ordinary superhero movie that did nothing new; it was bland. The villain was cool and gives viewers a lot of food for thought, but the action sucked, which pretty unforgivable, in my opinion, and every other character except Killmonger was forgettable. Other than that, yea, you can see this and maybe you'd like it but I don't recommend it. It's just a boring film - I was bored and I wanted it to end."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"We all know that the MCU, more now than before, has been incredibly inclined towards humour, and in some of their installments have gotten it wrong; e.g. Age of Ultron and Ragnarok, however they've also gotten it right in other films such as Ant-Man and Homecoming. Black Panther, I'm so happy to say, falls firmly in the latter. The humour in this film is so well placed that I can't understand how MCU fails then, to consistently get it right, but I imagine it's all poised on who the director is. With that said, Black Panther is NOT perfect, it is very flawed, mainly due to one very major aspect.One thing Black Panther just got wrong, was Black Panther himself, and though it may be understandable is to how they made that mistake, as an MCU/comics/film fan, I can't ignore that fact/issue.Truthfully (and I hope you can try to appreciate this perspective), for these African cultures, unknown to the planet, to be put on the world stage in a positive light through such an established franchise on such a big scale for the very first time, is a moment both ""black"" and ""white"" America and the rest of the world can't fully imagine. Be African, in Africa and watch isiXhosa, a language spoken by millions in South Africa (a country, not an area) on global display, and then the Motlatsi, Sefate, Khotso and Morena (seSotho for King) apparel and heritage being put on the map, then watch Black Panther; it was sentimental, however, that was both a good thing, and a bad thing.Marvel Studios and Ryan Coogler didn't get the balance right. They focused way too much on portraying a culture and used the Black Panther as it's driving force, and thus neglected fleshing out Black Panther. So, Black Panther was illustrated during a celebration that wasn't necessarily part of the Black Panther arc. That was a major problem. Africa deserves to be recognized by the world, and doing it through Black Panther was right because of it's magnitude and inspiration, however was done wrong, because of the equilibrium.All that aside however, I absolutely loved the cast; notably Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett,and specifically, Letitia Wright, Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis; they were just too amazing.The visuals were stunning, however the pacing was off from time to time. The score was pretty good, and the story was more than satisfactory while the script was crisp.Again, Black Panther is not perfect. Pacing, balancing and neglect issues, with an amazing cast that delivered on a solid script with stunning visuals made Black Panther a very enjoyable watch, with a side of; it could've easily been better. 7/10."
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2021,5/10,"Yeah, this was another film on my Disney module. Yes, I am also a white guy trying to justify why I don't think this film is the greatest thing since whatever Marvel film came before it. But you know what, I'll start by saying this: if you are a black person, you will definitely get more out of this than I did, because I know damn well that I can't relate to being oppressed for centuries and then seeing a film with a cast that almost entirely look like you where their skin colour and culture is celebrated rather than enslaved or genocided.With that said, it's a Marvel film. If you take away the slightly more interesting aesthetics and soundtrack from the African inspirations, then what you're left with is...just another one. The only thing I could see that slightly raises it above the others is the main villain. Unlike most others in this series, he has believable and understandable motivations, and even says something not entirely untrue about society and the struggles black people have with it.So I like him, but other than that...the acting is fine, some of the dialogue is cringe central, the directing is flat as all hell, the production design is good even if some of the effects look honestly really bad, and man are all the characters other than the main villain booooooring.I can't deny how important of a film this is culturally, but I can wish it was a better film that gave this moment to black people."
BLACK PANTHER,1 December 2021,7/10,"Very good Marvel movie. I think the director has put together a good cast, we have a good story and a good villain. But I still think that the film is slightly overestimated in the context of the Oscars and the nomination for best film, it seems forced to me. Very good superhero movie, but it doesn't offer me anything special or spectacular."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2019,3/10,"I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero¬¥s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2019,10/10,"This is more than a film. The Black Panther movie is a cultural phenomenon. A fresh and sterling example of how it takes the whole world to help the whole world achieve a higher and more salutary plane and state of survival. This should be painfully obvious, but evidently needs restating every now and then with all the ways and means available and at our disposal.There is an understated depth and complexity to this movie that viewers and fans will be exploring and discovering and debating and enlightening themselves about for years to come. After the dust has cleared and settled from all the knee-jerk reactions and cultural shock, mine included, people will at length be done shaking their heads with a wry smile at how two Jewish Americans also members of a group persecuted throughout the millennia could somehow through a medium designed for soldiers at war and more particularly for children find themselves members among the unlikely authors of a re-genesis of African and Human Consciousness.This is essentially what Jack Kirby and Stan Lee have done. Make no mistake about it. The Black Panther is the brainchild and the product of the Marvel Universe which is the invention and result of visionary artists and writers such as Kirby and Lee who postulated it into existence.The appeal here is to the imaginative prowess of Mankind. Many writers and artists of color were so mired down in the angst of the oppression and exploitation of indigenous peoples around the world and their victimization that they were hard put to envision a place and a time where and when this would no longer be the case. Richard Wright was able to have his protagonist Bigger Thomas consider why Blacks did not have their own governments and armies in a nascent fashion, but his roadmap to Wakanda and other destinations of interest in Africa was somehow misplaced. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois were busily engaged in postulating an education for African Americans that might proof them against and preclude future involvement with slavery, but only Marcus Garvey and a few others, possessed the pluck, through whatever personal limitations, to suggest that there could be a United States of Africa or a Commonwealth of African States. We have yet to postulate a media which will celebrate the industrial, entrepreneurial, and technological triumphs of people of color in concert with the peoples of the world, bu this movie is a step in the right direction.There is more that can be said and, I'm sure, will be said. But for now, let me just say, kudos to the cast and crew. You have done a monumental thing. Perhaps one day we will consider as well the Epic of Sundiata and Gassiere's Lute as appropriate grist for the Cinema..."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,Black Panther has its hits and miss but one can't deny it's visual spectacle and the characters development it had. Marvel Cinematic Universe succeeds again.
BLACK PANTHER,19 January 2019,8/10,"Comparing other movies of the MCU with 'Black Panther', it has a very unique, african vibe around it. They bring a new component into the universe with Wakanda.
The amount of effort bringing Wakanda and it's culture and people to life is remarkable. Also the cast was very well chosen, from smaller to bigger roles.
The CGI and action was great for the major parts even though some scenes seem to be lacking the fine tuning, for example some spacecrafts looked a bit out of place or some fighting scenes looked a bit surreal. But it's not too bad, especially having the bigger picture in mind.
The plot made sense, as far as anything makes sense in the Marvel Universe. Yet you know it's more to introduce the 'Black Panther' and his history in the Universe and a standalone movie would've been better for dramaturgical purposes."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,8/10,"In my opinion, Black Panther tells one of the more interesting stories on the MCU, featuring a cast of brilliant actors who bring Wakanda to life. Notice, how i coined Wakanda rather than Black Panther specifically, this is due to the fact that Wakanda was o much of a character in the film and so many of its culture, natural beauty and citizens were fleshed out and made a large part of this film. In fact a lot of time and dedication were gone into the other aspects of the film. I thought that the film had one of MCU's more interesting villains as well, in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, quite a lot is gone into his back story and as a street level villain I think he worked quite well. Much like the use of Vulture in Spider-man Homecoming. But, while in that case, the villain is menacing within a smaller 'street level' situation I thought in this case it's not necessarily Killmonger himself but what he represents that makes him the compelling villain that he is. Granted, he had a significant motive that can be empathized with he had a significant tie as to what he represented, the flaws in the former king T'Chaka and the conflicts that is bound to burden our hero T'Challa, the struggles he must make to choose between the right path and the path that would best benefit his people. I also enjoyed the many characters from Wakanda, Danai Gurira's Okoye was a strong female character that was a badass. Letitia Wright's Shuri who was a fun and interesting character as well. There was a decent amount of comedy that does not come into the expense of drama that the previous Thor Ragnarok may sometimes be criticized for and on a whole was a thrilling ride.All of which set in a setting that is stunning to look it, te blend of modern skyscrapers and vast mountains/valleys. And, the Wakandan culture, the rituals, the tribes, the vibrant colours all of which were presented in such a way that engages audiences and makes them grow more curious as to the many other facets of the fictional culture."
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2019,,"Come on now, this is on long toy commercial. I wanted to like it, I was hoping it would be somewhat fresh, but it is without a doubt the most formulaic super hero movie I have seen in a very long time -- and since I have teens I have seen them all.
It is literally childish as if made for a audience of five-year-olds. Did the film's makers assume their audience was less intelligent than the typical audience? The dialogue is laughable in parts and everything is telegraphed with a neon sign."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,10/10,"Black Panther, is the #1 Movie in the World, like everybody said it would be. And I'm so glad they gave the film an MTV Movie Awards win, an Oscar win, and an Academy award winner for best picture, best score, and the best movie of the year!Wakanda Forever!Black Panther will return in Avengers: Infinity War"
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,6/10,"With his regal demeanour, noble disposition, and unquestionable ability to kick an ass or 20, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa proved himself worthy of the Black Panther suit in Captain America: Civil War. Had his solo film expanded on these three qualities, while delivering the necessary fights and funnies that define the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have made for a good film. Ryan Coogler's Black Panther does much more.Like most of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the plot runs by a tried-and-true blueprint. This time, it follows the footsteps of the first Thor with story beats surrounding royalties, loyalties, betrayals, outcasts and family secrets that feel familiar (sometimes predictable). However, they play naturally to the majestic and technologically advanced world of Wakanda.If anyone deserves to retire as kings and queens, it's the art department. There's so much creativity displayed in the makeup, costuming, sets, and sci-fi designs that a single watch cannot absorb it all. From the striking attire of the Dora Milaje warriors to the sand-like magnetic thingy-ma-bobs that power Wakandan tech, every detail adds wonderment to a world that imagines an African culture gifted with near-unlimited resources and untainted by colonialism.The poisons of history play a big part in Black Panther - not just with colonialism, but with any past act that later proves to be problematic. This is what powers Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, a vicious yet sympathetic adversary with enough depth to make him one of the more memorable villains in the MCU.However, the true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye. They're given multiple times to shine using both their heroic fists and their stand-up comedy routines while sticking to their own rounded subplots.Weirdly enough, Get Out's Oscar-nominated star Daniel Kaluuya ends up falling a little flat as commander W'Kabi, using a casual 'did you just fart?' face for almost every confrontation. His relationship with Okoye also seems non-existent until the film coughs it up during an otherwise exciting climax. But those are minor complaints for a film that feels gargantuan in almost every other way."
BLACK PANTHER,15 June 2018,8/10,"I was skeptical entering Black Panther. Not because I was worried it would be a bad film, but because I was worried it would attempt to enter a political dialogue where Marvel Studios simply doesn't belong. I was pleasantly surprised to see that, although it did touch on serious issues in America, it did so in a respectful and humanistic manner. It wove these issues into the motivation for our antagonist, who joins the ranks of a new breed of villain in cinema; a villain who the audience can relate to. I look forward to this trend continuing, and not only in superhero films. The highlight of this viewing for me was the phenomenal hip hop score led by Kendrick Lamar."
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,9/10,"We may well could be in front of ""The Movie"" of the MCU, by virtue of its coldness by man-made entertainment or fantastic narratives as a plot base, placing a homogeneous criticism on race, social chaos, feminism, power, politics, technology, honor and human demons, an unusual maneuver hitherto by the company that works perfectly in the ideal story, as T'Challa, king of Wakanda, becomes a milestone in the history of comic film adaptations, because of it's the first one that manages to blur that unresectable concentration by comedy and action in order to enter a field of more realistic, moralistic and compelling treatment, of course, without relegating an exciting, kinetic and fearless process to reach that stage.First of all, it must be said that ""Black Panther"" isn't a masterpiece. What's more, I took a while sympathizing with it running the first fifteen minutes, nonetheless, after having understood what was not working to allow me to automatically connect with the film, I came to the conclusion that such incompatibility was illogically derived from its original out-of-the-ordinary nature, that requested feature by all cinephile; Here the social and artistic message matters through creativity, because when it materializes in front of me, I found it impossible not to appreciate tremendous work, a fully unknown universe of stories or its introductory function to ""Infinity War"" aren't what make it compelling at all, what's make it unique is the value it holds for itself, since it relays an infinity of reflections and perceptions on reality, managing to touch everyone's hearts, especially to those poorly represented in and by cinema. It was such the transcendence that I decided to skip its post-credits scenes, I didn't want anything to do away with stupefaction that the nation of Wakanda left in my mind. This is a film that must be experienced on the larger screen under obligation. Also, unlike Marvel's previous flicks, this must be processed and analyzed primarily by the brains of adults and young people, obviously, without dismissing the full-fun ride constructed for the most little enthusiasts.Thereafter, ""BP"" is a cinematic blast. Opening with a sterling introduction to the place of the events, Wakanda twists the aim of a world power to turn it into a highly secret nation, rich in technology, advances in transport, health, economics and politics at the expense of the strongest metal in the MCU: Vibranium. However, they prefer to keep a low profile, creating a kind of selfishness by remaining hidden from outside eyes and ears, since, without hesitation, they'd be a sure target for the most vulnerable and near-to-extinct nations. And here the first topic for discussion comes up, one that will keep talking to the curious for quite some time. There is the fact that they can choose to remain anonymous to preserve intact their wealth and their nation standing or reveal their kingdom before a world burning in flames of hatred, finding it difficult to relinquish part of its stability in favor of the recovery and hope of the homeless, coming into play two ways which are really close to the current world stage.Another of its many strengths, which is present in the solid screenplay, is the important participation of women in the storyline. Just like ""Wonder Woman"" did, this film proudly represents what it means to be a woman of color, an impressive achievement - even if it's sad to mention: what differentiates white and black women? -for those ""minorities"", since each one of them receives a virtuous development, each one treasures a coherent and exciting dramatic background, daring individuals with hopeful characteristics; courageously intelligent believers, figures who honor two of the least respected groups by a society that grows in machismo and vanity: women and black people. In addition to writing rich and electrifying stories and foundations for them, the fighting scenes, which lies on the shoulders of the Dora Milaje, are superb, very close to Patty Jenkins' spectacular combats executed by the Amazons, the relation is valid thanks to the impact of these gigantic set-pieces that ends up being inspiring, getting to raise another important analogy. A Trojan army with three horrific beasts as helpers fighting against an army of female warriors - it should not be a source for joy, but it's such a representation of the female gender that this really means a significant breakthrough - struggling for their family, their lands, their king. This kind of scene symbolizes commitment by equality, not only for actresses who aspire to have important roles in the Mecca of cinema, but for every lady around the globe who is hurt by the dominance of her husband, father or boss; an inspiring incorporation that allows to dream of a more balanced planet, a readjustment to the balance of fairness and respect. From the beginning, they lose the horizon trying to build the mystery around the mansion, without noticing that, in half of the story, we no longer care what happens to any of them.Visually, Coogler's feature film is a glorious feast. Omitting only eventual perceptions of green screen in the background of fight scenes in the cascade and some flaws on special effects in the glamorous car chase, it can claim to have the same bravery and power in the pictures as the most recent release of the company, as it represents a radical color and style opposite with respect to Taika Waititi's colorful ode, here sobriety leads to sublimity in many of the scenes that enroll with honor in the best of the MCU; it's impossible to believe how the studio is surpassed by each new entry and this is no exception. Wakanda is as beautiful as complex thanks to the hard work of Rachel Morrison, the art & production department and anyone involved in the creative and artistic process, is magnificent and evidenced in the final product, an organic story about forgiveness and honor that experiment brand-new features for sure. Just like Ragnarok for Thor, Wakanda is another great discovery, not only for its magnetic culture, but for the artistic potential of this land that connects technology and nature organically.There are many people agree that Ludwig G√∂ransson's score will be a strong contender for several gold awards. In addition to a lot of praises, the accompanying melodies and specific compositions that nourish fight sequences, moments of tension or a trivial talk are spectacular, his score has a great influence by African culture, drums and instruments are compactly intermingled with the vitality and extravagance of heroic melodies, a necessary choice as thanks to this important effect, the film manages to be what it is, a representative marvel. It should be noted that the soundtrack created in the name of the film by Kendrick Lamar goes very much in the style of his songs and is concordant; especially ""Pray For Me"" included in one of the most stylistic scenes, where The Weeknd's stunning vocals shine on their own.And finally: Ryan Coogler. It's not odd that the film opens in Oakland, California, because the filmmaker is from there, he knows the ailments of his people, knows the suffering and the causes of it because, like B. Jordan, we catch reflected in his work a sincere representation of hope and union for the entire black race, a love letter to his town in which their lives, values and dreams are highlighted. With only two feature films, Coogler directs his big Hollywood directional debut and he gets what Jordan Peele got with his opera prima as a director: to talk about a multitude of issues of global significance conveying his clear and realistic position. The film works in many fields, it's perceptible the effort in the idea and it's perceptible that the director knew how to portray what on the paper seemed so difficult, here, he's not limited to using a fantastic language because he also mixes culture and diversity in a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities. The American director and screenwriter presents one of the most interesting visions put on the genre, because it's one with foundation and purpose: to reach the heart of minorities, giving a message of peace, union and equality, symbolized by a hopeful ending very similar to ""The Last Jedi's"" final scene, a little boy starts dreaming.""Black Panther"" by Ryan Coogler transforms what a superhero movie must be, delivering children of color an idealized model with which they can dream now. In the long run, the film from the ""Fruitvale Station"" director and screenwriter works in many fields at the same time, it serves as a social commentary on the selfishness of the white people, politics, vices and discrimination while coherently produces a novel and unusual journey among Wakanda's technological and fascinating landscapes. Somehow, it's the ""Get Out"" of Marvel Studios, and reverses the comic-adaptation formula, placing its hero in harsh situations that can be compared to the real-life difficulties of a normal person. By far, one of the most different and original superhero flicks to date, ""Black Panther"" will serve as an illusion to many boys and girls, men and women who see in Marvel's dramatized works a possibility of change, an encouragement to start over again, even though when they get out of the theater and know that one more friend is gone for a society feeding on violence, inequality and apathy."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,"This has to be by far the worst movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I will explain.The movie manages to have amazing visuals but it is highly political: and while i understand that works for some people I do not enjoy being hammered over the head with politics. Chadwick Boseman is good as ever as T'Challa and even the supporting Wakandan cast manages to do a good job, but Michael B Jordan's Kilmonger is absolutely one of the worst Comic Book Movie villains I have ever seen. Not only do they keep the formula of making the villain the hero's mirror opposite (which works more times than not) but the filmmakers try real hard for you to like, pity and feel sorry for such a horribly designed character whose main trait is being an awful, petty and vengeful human being.There is no real substance to the movie unless you wanna be deeply immerse into race politics, not my cup of tea to be honest. Which makes me give Black Panther a 5 out of 10, the lowest score I have ever given a movie from this saga.I did not enjoy it, I am not looking forward for a sequel, not even if Namor showed up."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,7/10,"I think that the only thing that will damage the social impact, and the relevance of Black Panther would be if the movie sucked, but it doesn't, so, this is one of the most important movies of recent years, side by side with Wonder Woman, is definitely a message to the world ""The times are changing!"", and man, this is so great, I really love that movement, and I get emotional with every new color kid story that I read, about how the movie was important to them, this is just fantastic, and is what the movie industry was supposed to be like.Well, that topic aside, I will talk about just the movie now. I will be honest here, is not one of my favorite Marvel movie of all time, in fact, I think that has more problems than the majority of them. First the great things about it, everyone is talking about, but I have to say: Michael B. Jordan is fantastic on the movie, is definitely one of the best MCU villains by far (he doesn't have that much of a competition, but is ok). You understand his character, you buy his motivation, sometimes you even think that he has a better point than the real hero (even though he is a murderer and etc). I love the character, and the way that the movie builds him.The soundtrack is really good to. I love the ""world-building"" of Wakanda, you also buy what they say, that is almost an alien country that was here the whole time. Almost all the Wakanda character are good, you like them (T'Challa's sister, the Doramilages, even T'Challa himself). Buut, some aspects does not work, like T'Challa, I don't know man, I just can't like that much about him, I don't know if is the performance (Chadwick Boseman is not the most charismatic person in the world), I just really don't give that much s**t about him (in fact, Michael B. Jordan character is much more likeable). The fight scenes are also a big issue that I have with the movie, most of them are with really really short lights, and you almost doesn't see anything, the cuts also are very brusque, just the Cassino scene doesn't have that issue. The CGI is also something that bother me a lot, there so much in it! (And when I say that, I know that the majority of the superhero movies have that, but the thing is, that when they are good, you just don't notice - like the first Avengers) But here, my god, the final fight is almost like a big budget video game cutscene (and is also very dark again).Well, in short, even though Black Panther isn't the greatest superhero movie of all time, it's without a doubt one of the most important of all time, it's a time changer, an I really hope that a generation will be inspire by its message, that is highly important, and needs to be listen. It has some flaws, it's far from Marvel's best, but, also like WW, it's overall a good movie, and this is enough to not damage its importance."
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,8/10,As far as the entire Marvel scene goes this may have been the most vital film. An absolute amazing cast and great story and background. A 8 out of 10
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,6/10,"To be honest I wasn't convinced by the introduction of Black Panther in ""Captain America : Civil War"", there was absolutely nothing wrong with the performance it just didn't have the same impact for me as it did with majority of audiences. However after viewing the characters' solo film I am now much more interested in the character. Although saying that I have a mixed bag of emotions after watching this film because I feel as if I'm missing out on something because I just thought this film was ok/average. The praise that this film has received and is receiving from critics and fans a like is amazing to see. On one hand I can understand where people are coming from if they absolutely loved this film, however I can also understand people for not liking this film as well. PositivesRyan Coogler has done a great job with this film and it is really good to see a young inexperienced director being given a chance to directed a big budget blockbuster. The directing is, for the most part, very good fro start to finish and definitely standouts out from all the other entries in the MCU. For me he has only increased his reputation with the industry and I cant wait to see what he does next.The cast are all really good in the film, Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Martin Freeman are all really strong throughout the film. However there is no surprise to say that there are two standout performances in the film, firstly Chadwick Boseman. He is really good in the film and has a interesting character arc throughout the film, he shows a lot of range in emotions. Definitely an improvement from his cameo in ""Civil War"" and I'm interested to see where the character goes next. However for me personally the standout of the film is Michael B. Jordan as KIllmonger. He is simply fantastic from to start to finish and the best part to his character is the fact that you can understand his motivations. In a strange way I felt a lot of empathy for his character even though he is the villain, one of the best villains in the MCU for a long while. Negatives Now unfortunately this is where I start to get confused where all the praise for this film is coming from because at heart this film is nothing new. The story of a young man being named king after his fathers death, weaving his way through the early stages of his monarchy. Only then to have it taken away by the revengeful character who comes into the film and ""kills"" him. Miraculously is then found to be half alive, come its a MCU film what else did you expect, sent back to his kingdom to have a showdown fight with the villain.....the end. Is it me or is that story familiar and not that original really, like don't get me wrong I understand the social messages of the film. I understand what an amazing achievement and landmark moment in cinema this is but I was expecting more, considering the praise this film is getting. I had even seen some reviews of this film being on the level of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Logan"" which is insulting to those films to say the least.The only other complaint I have is that the CGI here and there is a little hit and miss, there are some waterfall scenes that look a little jarring, but other than that it was fine.Overall its ok/average 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, it is nowhere near as good as I hoped or thought this film was going to be considering the incredible praise this film has. Even though I didn't personally particularly love it I can understand why people do, I can also understand why people don't love this film and both of those opinions are valid. Directing very good, performances really good, other than that its just your run of the mill MCU film and not that mind blowing."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,7/10,"Wow! what a load of harsh reviews on this movie! I liked it, the cgi effects,that ship of his looked insanely cool..Micheal b jordan was nailing it as the villian! great choice in picking him..The whole movie right from the opening had an air of quality abt is production, at least thats how it struck me..It Did feel much longer than it needed to be and started to get a bit tedious twords the end..The fight scenes were Not good and not even remotely close to being as good as the fight scenes in winter soldier,which is a benchmark for action movies..the fight scenes were slow,ponderous,and showed little in the way of speed and good technique..I loved seeing michone from walking dead and she brought more ferocity than the panther did to her fight scenes,plus she looked smokin hot in the red dress at the nightclub! I hear people complaing abt the accents but for Gods sake if u were native to that continent, thats how people speak! grow up....go to britian or austrailia and you will hear heavy accents as well...The ""other"" villian i thought he looked familiar but couldnt place him and then learned that was andy serkis, AKA gollum and planet of the apes actor ect..I am not a comics reader so i never knew the backstory,nor how panther got his powers nor how his suit saved kinetic energy that he could release later...thats seriously cool! anyway overall i liked it! could have been shorter and the fight scenes need to be of a much more adept skill level for a super hero..cgi looked freakin awesome to me...worth a view"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"It definitely is wonderful to see a big blockbuster film like this have a majority black led cast and not have the focus be on their oppression. Not that stories of slavery, racism & police brutality aren't important, but I think its important for little black kids to see themselves as Kings or Queens too, who also are self sufficient. So I hope this movie does trigger Hollywood to do more movies in a similar vein. Now with that aside, how does fall within the MCU for me? Overall, I enjoyed it. Though to be fair, there hasn't been a movie yet that I have really hated, a few that Ive been a bit disappointed by thats it. Im still re-evaluating my current standings (so this may change), but I think this is likely around the 5th best movie for me. There is a lot of stuff that is great. In particular I really liked Letitia Wright as Shuri. There's just such a brightness to her. She's incredibly delightful, smart, funny and gets to kick some ass too. Killmonger is a great villain. Hes not just lame villain the hero fights in the 3rd act and is defeated after 10 minutes. He has a presence throughout. He's also such a genuinely dark character who will literally kill whoever's in his path with little to no remorse. He'll blind side and double cross you if he gets the chance. I also thought Klaue was a lot of fun. Yes, he's a bad guy, but he's just crazy, chaotic kind of kooky and Andy Serkis breathes some life into him. There are also some gorgeous costumes and sets. A couple of funny lines here and there (my favourite was the vegetarian line) but it definitely doesnt focus on that too much. There were things I disliked or am nit-picky about. I eye-rolled so hard at the ""What are those"" line. Its a dated vine/meme/whatever. It was never that funny to begin with and feels like a cheap gag to get some kids in the theater to laugh. I didn't buy into Daniel Kaluuya's character motivations. There is that line about how Klaue killed his parents, so I understand he wants them dead, but it just doesnt seem believable how easily he turned on T'Challa. Also in accordance with his character, him and Danai Gurira are supposed to be in a relationship and yet we barely get any interaction between the two. I think the height of their interaction is calling each other ""My Love"". I assume they added it in because they wanted to add some stakes when his character supports Killmonger, but I didnt think it added anything. Im not saying we had to devote a 30 minute subplot to their romance, but a few more moments here and there may have helped to solidify them as a couple and make you care a little bit more later on in the film when you see them on opposite sides of the battlefield. Also, I dont understand how Angela Bassets hair SUDDENLY turns white. So yeah, a couple of grievances that stopped me from fully enjoying my experience, but overall a lot of stuff to like as well. I think if you're a fan of the MCU you'll like this one too."
BLACK PANTHER,29 January 2019,5/10,"All men are created equal regardless of skin color, but this movie, which has gained critical hype that most superhero movies never get is made to seem like it offers something different than any generic superhero movie. Well, it doesn't. It's paint-by-numbers for the genre but like ""Wonder Woman"", it differs from the norm because of skin color (Wonder Woman focused on womens' rights politically). But outside of this, it offers nothing outside of the ordinary, and frankly, I never liked superhero films outside of Batman, Superman, and seldom Spiderman.Just like my greatest concern with the vast majority of ""superhero"" movies, my biggest concern and knock on them has to do with insulting viewers' intelligence and dumbing down the viewer by playing on a fantasy world that removes all scientific facts and logic of what is known to be reality. This could never happen. And I have to say that this was the one thing that made the one and only modern superhero movie a true classic back in 2008; The Dark Knight brought Bruce Wayne and the Joker into the real world, minus a couple jump scenes. This is pure fantasy and childish, only appealing to kids who don't know better, and it's manipulating them for that for their SJW agenda.This movie is racist because it is expressing black power over white people as a sort of utopian vision for the future, where white people are slaves to black people, just like Wonder Woman fancies a future where men are subordinated to women in power.Within 5 minutes, between the actors talking like they're reading off of the paper with no depth and emotion, and the obvious clich√©s, I shut this POS off. 5 minutes was more than enough of my time to waste on such tripe. But don't worry, I shut 90% of all superhero movies off within the first 10 minutes, even the ones with white people; the only difference is the ones with white people aren't nominated for Oscar awards and overhyped.This is nothing more than by-the-numbers comic book flick, but one that is unabashedly racist towards white people."
BLACK PANTHER,10 July 2018,5/10,"In Rotten Tomatoes it is listed on the top of Marvel movies! Trust on RT has been vanished. Even on IMDB. It was showing 8.5+ rating from the beginning of the release. My expectation toward this movie was never high as I knew this poor-cast movie/seeing the trailers, can't be a great but just an enjoyable one. It is not actually enjoyable but predictable, rather, most avoidable movie of Marvel history. I and my wife and younger family searching for the villain, who would be a great powerful one. Our search remains, and we could't find any villain here. Yes a villain is shown with below average acting and a cheap body building figure with dumb hair style. Sorry.. All the rating above 5 are paid, unreal. It deserve below 5 but I rate this as 5 because I actually don't hated the movie, I hate this high rates on the market."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2020,1/10,"There is literally nothing good about this movie. When I saw the commercials and learned of the premise I really wanted to like it too. I mean the whole idea of a African-esque mythology/mysticism based super hero movie was almost too good to be true for me, because I am actually very into African Shamanism & Folklore. I was so enthused for this movie that I tried watching it three separate times. But every time I tried watching it the results were the same. Every scene was excruciating to watch, and I couldn't suffer through more than 20 minutes or so, it was just so bad.As I said, there is nothing good about this movie. And that includes every aspect of the film making. The writing, the acting, the directing, the production, they are all complete crap. They are literally so bad that it is surreal.What this movie is is one of the biggest works of over-dramatization of all time. This film is more over-dramatized than I have ever seen anything ever be, including Aquaman, and that is saying a lot. It is the same style of unrealistically overdone writing and acting you would see in a B movie, but when a super overdone production as well. The movie looks like it costs more than any movie ever made, but it sounds and plays like it was written and directed by high schoolers. It is so bad that every scene and every bit of dialogue was just so over the top and forced that it was painful to watch and listen to. It's just not natural. People don't talk and act like that. And story's don't happen that way. Its utterly ridiculous.The only reason this movie was made in the first place, and was so ""acclaimed"" by whatever idiots thought it was good, is because of affirmative action ""black power"" aspect. This movies aforementioned african folklore style of storytelling and theme, and its all black ensemble made it a SJW statement that anyone who considers themselves a democrat, liberal, activist, etc would have to declare is the best movie of the year...for the purpose of promoting affirmative action for black people. But this is a movie, and we need to judge it as a movie. And as a movie, it is not at all good in any way. Objectively speaking, if you were to replace the all black cast with a cast that was all white, and all of the SJW's didn't look through the black power promotion lens at it, it would have never gotten good ratings. Because it may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. And that is coming from someone who has seen thousands of them and studied them. So I am not making that statement lightly. Like I said, I tried watching this one 3 times. So I certainly have enough perspective here and am not being small minded.It would be much better to promote black artists/art by promoting the best of it. You cannot simply applaud a movie that is absolutely terrible just because it has only black people in it. These are adults, not toddlers. They should have the same standards to live up to as the rest of the film industry."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2018,10/10,"This movie is awesome. Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot.  Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did.  So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office? Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium.  Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy.  Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting.  Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand. The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless. The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office. Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri.  Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count.  Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars."
BLACK PANTHER,1 December 2021,8/10,"This one lacked a lot of the star fire power the other Marvel movies had and maybe that was a good thing. Great acting. Real interesting plot, it was different than the others. I love watching Michael B Jordan act. I think he'll have a long career."
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2021,10/10,"What makes a great superhero film for me? I look for three things outside visual stimulation: a logical plot, strong character development and a villian who I can understand. Black Panther not only exceeded those benchmarks, but set the bar higher for all future superhero films.I truly believe that Black Panther is one of the greatest standalone films in the MCU and a lot of that is due to an amazing script, gorgeous visuals and electric performances from the two leads: Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Similar to my previous point, I also truly believe that Erik Killmonger is the greatest single-film villain in the entire MCU. I understand his ""why"" and that makes me invested.There is a reason why Black Panther was such a cultural phenomenon. Where Taika was tasked with completely rebranding Thor, Ryan Coogler had the monstrous task of creating the nation of Wakanda. What he created was more than just a movie, it has become ""Wakanda Forever""."
BLACK PANTHER,1 October 2018,8/10,"Just finished seeing The Black Panther at the theater. I must say I am very impressed. Marvel really crafted an interesting world in Black Panther full of fascinating characters.The best aspect of the film is easily the world building. Black Panther crafted the Wakanda world with such detail it was breath taking. The movie really went above and beyond shaping a unique and engaging culture for their world scape. Acting wise the movie was packed to the brim with talent. There really wasn't a bad performance in the movie. I particularly enjoyed Danai Gurira who was bad ass as always. The acting was only enhanced by the fact the characters were all well written. Both Killmonger and Klaw were interesting and engaging villains in their own way. Killmonger in particular was a standout in the Marvel Universe for an interesting villain. It was also great to see Andy Serkis in person for a change. Animation wise the movie was gorgeous. There was a lot of pure eye candy in this film. On top of that the choreography for the fight scenes was outstanding. The final large all out battle was particularly satisfying. who doesn't love seeing someone riding rhino into battle?Whoever made the soundtrack also did a great job. Sound was a big part of this movie and directly tied into a lot of scenes. The music really helped to immerse you into the Black Panther World.I did feel the movie was a bit uneven though. The movie had a very strong opening and ending, but the middle was a bit weak. You could easily predict what was going to happen mid-way through the movie. That didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have preferred to see a tighter script.Overall this is one of the most original and interesting Marvel movies to date. Despite its minor flaws it was a great ride from start to finish. A 8.25 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,10/10,At first I wasn't really excited about seeing a sci-fi movie.. but when I finally went I was exhilarated. I'm a senior citizen and this was the first movie of this kind of ever seen in my life. As an avid movie buff I was thrilled and excited. I went with my grandkids and great-grandkids and they're really really loved it. Which of course made all the more thrilling for me
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,8/10,"Marvel Studios releases blockbuster after blockbuster over and over again. And the great part it never gets boring watching them! This particular one had quite a ""few"" expectations and managed to overcome most of them. Also, in my view, this film production company set new standards in terms of movie quality, effects, mockery (I'm referring to the fact that it causes immediate laughter at funny scenes) and overall satisfaction. By far, it is the best one. It has such a compelling story! It's a must watch, I admit! ""Oscar"" says on it next year (you'll see). Go grab a seat in the movie theatre and enjoy it! In 3D, if possible!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,10/10,"I watch this like a week ago with my friend and we enjoyed it. The story is interesting like it's not one of those movie that you watch and forgot about like a week later. The story is uniqe in it shape and form. Great acting too, full of emotion during each scene. I hate ot how people make stuff into a race thing like some people think this is soms race movement. First of all it's a movie, not a video you find on YouTube that talk about race. I just hate when one person have to ruined something it. Anyways good movie and I'm going to see it again :-) 10.2/10"
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"Mercy and eternity for Chadwick .. I hope that he rest in peace .. A wonderful and very interesting movie .. I rejoiced for the appearance of Danai, because I miss her from the series The Walking Dead."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,6/10,"Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was one of the best characters in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. He was the ultimate hero; cool, confident, and determined to stop evil. Two years later, he's starring in his own film that shifts him into the leading role. While not being the best superhero film or even an overall good film, Black Panther is still a solid experience that makes for another adequate chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film follows the reign of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther, over the country of Wakanda. On the surface, Wakanda is a poverty-stricken country, but behind smoke and mirrors, it is revealed that it is actually the most advanced civilization on earth. This advancement comes from the extraterrestrial metal vibranium, which landed in Wakanda thousands of years ago and allowed them to advance further than anyone else. Fearing the outside world, they isolated themselves inside a hologram projection system, never allowing themselves to open up to the rest of humanity. T'Challa is a firm believer of isolation, but his views are challenged by a new wave of Wakandans, ones led by the villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan, marking his third collaboration with Coogler). They see the world as weak and ripe for conquest. A rebellion soon breaks out that threatens to tear families and ties apart, as well as the whole of Wakanda. For boasting a revolutionary cast and director of newcomer Ryan Coogler, Black Panther never really feels original. It very much follows the typical superhero formula where the hero saves the day at first, a villain emerges and beats the hero, hero and his team regroup to fight back, and finally, hero returns and overcomes previous obstacle to beat the villain. I know almost every superhero film follows this formula, but this film was sold on the message that it would be different than the rest, when in fact it's the same as everyone else. Black Panther also has trouble with inconsistency when it comes to dialogue. The range of quality is all over the place as some lines are delivered really well and some are really poor. The script felt like it was written a couple years ago and never updated. Some of the jokes fall flat because they rely on trends that have faded away, such as the ""What are those!"" joke that was old a few years ago. Where the film stumbles in writing and storytelling it makes up for in its wide range of characters that piece everything together. There's a rule that no hero can truly work alone and that rule definitely applies to T'Challa as he is aided in his journey by his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a tech whiz that serves as the Q to his 007, and Okoye (Danai Gurira), a fierce warrior that never backs down from a fight. Also acting as support is T'Challa's queen mother Romonda (Angela Bassett) and his spiritual advisor Zuri (Forest Whitaker).Technically speaking, Black Panther does have some of the highest production quality of the MCU films. Having the setting of Wakanda allows the film to embrace colorful and lush natural locations. The visual effects used to create the world are really well done and the expert cinematography by Rachel Morrison really adds to the experience. About every actor brings their game here. Chadwick Boseman is the standout as T'Challa. He delivers on making his character believable. He's a king and hero, but also just a man thrust into a hard position very quickly. He has his flaws and Boseman highlights those perfectly. Playing his polar opposite is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is probably the most complex character. He's an outcast Wakandan who was abandoned in America during the 90s. Now after becoming almost a living legend among criminals, he's come to take his revenge on Wakanda. Jordan brings the rage and molds his character really well to fit the circumstances. The rest of the supporting cast fill in nicely, except for Forest Whitaker who is caught here trying too hard as always. Many will find Ryan Coogler's Black Panther to be a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre. It's an aesthetically pleasing film, but it's not one to jump and clap for. It never lives up to the hype but the film still never has below average quality. Avengers: Infinity War is boasting one of the biggest casts of all time, and having the Black Panther and Wakanda included is something that is going to be great to see."
BLACK PANTHER,30 November 2019,3/10,"Had hopes for this film as I liked the character in civil war but this movie is just bad. Story is so boring, horrible acting, and action scenes are mediocre. I'm also a big Michael b Jordan fan but his character is terrible in this. It was a challenge to finish this film and actually pay attention. You can skip this film and it would not make much difference in the marvel storyline."
BLACK PANTHER,23 May 2018,5/10,"It's a good film, to see just once... It has many failures, the story is not that strong, it has some good characters, but nothing special about the whole film"
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2021,6/10,"This is the Black Panther movie we wanted - with a good mix of African themes and ethnic pride in being black, I am all for that. Best superhero movie to watch in black history month. Nonetheless it is a fun mindless Marvel movie, but it's uniqueness comes with it being African, which I respect."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.Not that in the comic book film universe, the going has got tough for Marvel due to DC Comics. We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor. Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins.

Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it ""El Dorado"". They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.""Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not ""America First"", but it is ""Wakanda Forever"".While T'√áhalla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization. ""To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world"" - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story. The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point. He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue! Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last before the MCU's biggest film yet, Avengers: Infinity War. Black Panther was always going to be a comic book film that held significance. Like Wonder Woman last year, Black Panther has a cultural significance to it that is going to have a positive effect for the communities it is representing.Like all MCU films in recent years, Black Panther has it's own unique feel. This film has the perfect blend of the space and futuristic setting that Guardians presents with the ancientness and mystical shown in Doctor Strange. Ryan Coogler's directing really leans into that with many shots and scenes embracing the style and reaping the benefits.Also adding to the overall unique feel of the film is the use of music and score. I have always been a big fan of Ludwig Goransson's work with Childish Gambino and I though he did an amazing job with the music. The way it blended African instruments into the score and background music helped set the tone that this film presents. Much credit can also be given to Kenrick Lamar and the decision to bring him on in the first place for the soundtrack. Throughout the film you can hear his touches all throughout and it was a perfect foil to the tradition African instruments.While I have given much credit to the technical aspects of the film, it does not discount the work done by Ryan Coogler and his cast. As mentioned before, Coogler set a tone with this film that feels really unique and did a terrific job in pulling as these pieces together. The work done by Coogler puts him up there along side the work done by Taika Watiti last year as some of the best directing done by a director in the MCU.Getting into the cast, every one amazing in what they had to do. This film had quite a large cast and majority of them got a least one big moment that they got to step up and take a lead role in a scene. To highlight a few performances, Chadwick Boseman took what he did in Civil War and pushed it to a new limit, Michael B. Jordan nailed the role and cemented himself as one of the best villains in the MCU and Lupita Nyong'o brought life into a new character that I am looking forward to seeing in the years to come. Mentioning these roles of course takes nothing away from all the other great performances such as Letita Wright, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira.Like all MCU films, Black Panther is packed full of action. Again like most MCU films, the action style from Black Panther is a lot different to what we have previously see. The closest comparison for the style of action is something like from the TV show Vikings. We get to see some great tribe battles while getting some really well executed one on one battles. What most of the MCU films get right is the overall writing of the film, and Black Panther is no different. The story was extremely well written and fleshed out. The overall dialog with the characters was great with some terrific beats of humour. From a writing standpoint, there isn't anything in this film that could be seen as at least solid writing.Black Panther is a film that I believe doesn't have any glaring negatives. While each person will come out with little things here and there they didn't enjoy about the film, it is hard to pin point anything that felt out of place or poorly executed. For me, the only slight negative I had is that I feel that the film did not overall cover that much story. While I never felt like the pacing was off or that anything was rushed through, when I looked back at the film and recap it in my head, the list of everything that happened felt quite short. I would have been perfectly happy if they extended the film by 10 minutes or so and added an extra sequence, however the film works perfectly fine without it.Overall, I loved this film. While I am not the community that this film is going to effect significantly, I could still feel the significance of it like I did with Wonder Woman. On top of that, this film is a technical masterclass that all by helps the terrific performances and work done by Ryan Coogler and everyone else involved.9/10"
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,2/10,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I went into this film entirely objective (I didn't even watch the trailer). I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and was hoping this film would be good.The story is like any other superhero film story. The Wakanda aspect of the film is great. The technology used in the film is good. But there are a lot of clich√©s that kinda ruin the film.The acting is okay. Chadwick Boseman performs the best. Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, and Forest Whitaker perform below standard. Michael B. Jordan plays a generic and clich√©d villain. He performs the worst.The action if very good, but the films pacing is terrible. The film starts off fast but comes to a halt halfway through. The runtime is very overlong as well.Pros: Chadwick Boseman's performance, good action, cool tech, and WakandaCons: Generic storyline, okay acting, Michael B. Jordan as a generic villain, terrible pacing, and an overlong runtime.Overall Rating: 4.5I really wanted this film to be good, but it felt like an overlong, clich√©d, and dull film that was not needed in the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,6/10,"Mythology is all about where you wish you had come from. This film certainly delivers on that wish. I am not an automatic fan of Marvel Universe films, but this one was pretty good: not as lackluster and episodic as the first Guardians of the Galaxy (the 2nd was better), not as good as the original Ironman, from which it steals aplenty.The greatest irony in this film is the idea that the achievements of Western-Asian technology, just upped a bit due to vibranium-better-than-steel, really should be what comes Out of Africa. Unfortunately the film forsakes the true beauty of Africa in favor of CGI skyscraper towns and dragonfly-styled aircraft. Except for one scene with ancestral panthers in a tree.Still, as an action-driven superhero movie, it's pretty good. Some of the chase and war scenes are overly long. (The fight/car chase in the middle and final battle both start out promising, but just keep on giving and giving...) On the other hand there is reasonable character development, be it the villain cousin, the King, his warrior, priest, would be-wife, or sister. Poor Andy Serkis does not get much development though, so one can guess that he won't last all too long into this film. I know some people are not going to like the accents, but I've heard many native speakers from countries like Kenya or Zimbabwe, and the accent here is really a nice blend that evokes speakers of African languages speaking English. Probably a lot of US moviegoers have not heard many Africans, so this might seem a bit weird to them. The film probably on the slow side for current superhero moviegoers, but for someone raised in the 70s, who thinks the original Star Wars is very fast-paced, it's just right. One thing the film does well, given the irony at its central core, is to walk the fine line between glorifying either technology or ghetto, and point to what all humans surely could do to make this a better world.There are some plot holes, but even many of those serve the symbolism of the movie: Why leave the child behind in the ghetto without a father? Well, this is how it turns out for many young African-Americans, they don't go to Wakanda in reality. Others are just part of the comic book lore from which the film descends: such as how to keep an advanced civilization cloaked and completely unknown throughout history.I was torn between 6 and 7, but looked at my ratings for a number of ""6"" and ""7"" films, and for now at least decided that it was closer to 6. But a strong 6."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,5/10,"I really, really wanted to like this movie as I enjoyed such stories,but I found this movie boring. Poor acting, too much drama and yet the story and script with a lot of holes and not enough explanation. It is also just too sad and boring. This perhaps would've been an ok tv show,but I I am sure it would've been canceled after 1st season since it is absolutely nothing special. 
5/10 and all 5 for special effects. I am sad to give such poor review, but it just does not deserve any more. Especially when you compare to other such movies within the last 2 years which were very good."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"If this was white panther with white cast it would be slated to hell, it's awful. Most high ratings seem to be we finally have a black superhero, many of which come from the usual patronizing whites.You want real black superheroes watch Zulu Dawn or Long Walk To Freedom, This is pathetic in comparison."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,8/10,"The best superhero films of all (no particular order) are X-Men United, Iron Man (I), Thor (I), The Avengers (I), and Wonder Woman. Does Black Panther join that list? Maybe. It's hard to argue with the rave success it's having with audiences in theaters all over Africa, who are finally seeing themselves represented on screen. So bravo to that. I give this a solid 8/10 but if anyone wants to give this a 10/10 for its cultural impact alone, fine. (A personal footnote: I don't ever see myself ""represented"" in any superhero film characters at all, so in a sense I can feel free to identify with whoever I want. The closest I would come would probably be Hank Pym or Doctor Strange, but even those are bit of a stretch.)I like to look at the demographic breakdown of the IMDb rankings and in this case it's interesting that women rate it notably higher than men, in all age groups. Is the reason as simple as that there are so many very active female supporting characters? Those characters are good -- I thought Letitia Wright's portrayal of young Shuri was the most interesting role of the whole works. As the hero, Chadwick Boseman is kind of stuck being required to be noble and honorable all the time, so he's a little one-dimensional. But, I can't avoid pointing out that supporting characters aside, all the head honchos in this movie are still male. That's why Wonder Woman still stands alone, and why I'm looking forward to Captain Marvel (and even Black Widow if that does get made). It's a fine ensemble cast and they are all nicely invested in their characters. It was fun to listen to the Xhosa-accented English from the Wakandans throughout the film -- you get so used to it that when Eric Killmonger drops in with his Los Angeles-street accent (that we would normally be quite used to hearing) it actually jars. It's clear that this guy doesn't fit in and has to be removed as quickly as possible. Wakandan origin or not, he's beyond saving. For the rest of it, Marvel pulls off its normal excellent production values, and the action, scenery, backdrops, and special effects all have a high-gloss richness and texture that you associate (e.g.) with Steven Spielberg at his best. (The bright African sunlight doesn't hurt the colorful cinematography either.) One thing that I couldn't quite buy into was the Wakanda setting itself where we see traditional rural agrarian tribal life put right up against this futurist techno-ShangriLa. if their society is really this advanced, then why in heck do they choose a king by holding a primitive, brutal hand-to-hand combat ritual? Really, they need to get rid of that .... And the armored rhinos kind of went over the top for me. The on-screen Black Panther here and his techno-marvel suit are a powerful step up from what the character did in the actual comics, though I was never particularly interested in the BP character back then -- he seemed too much like Spidey or Captain America. In the movie MCU, however, they seem to have decided to make BP a major player in the whole greater story in which this is one more building block. After I left the theater I realized that BP felt quite a bit like a good James Bond film -- it zips around to multinational settings,it never lags, it gets through a lot of plot, and it gives you lots to look at for your money. I see that some writers give BP credit for 'discussing' world issues like immigration and the responsibilities of advanced nations to help others, but it seems like those kinds of things were just raised rather than really tackled. Can't have it all.On to Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,8 February 2019,8/10,"Although seen them in Civil War, I didn't waited enjoy so much this, and I don't know why, but this movie is so great, and all the thing that him involves, the culture of wakanda is explored very well, yours technology, the villain is amazing, you understand your motivation and is choked! The action is pretty cool, but the visual effects in sometimes doesn't work, but this don't affect the story, that it is impeccable <3"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,4/10,"Overhyped is not even the right word. fake reviews and fake ratings on essentialy very mediocre movie. there is absolutly nothing special about this movie. Two-dimentional charecters,no stand out action, but main problem is lazy wrighting! Why would you make it if you have almost nothing to say, and not even contrabuting anything to Infinity Stones story.
We would be much better off with Fury solo movie."
BLACK PANTHER,8 July 2018,8/10,"To be honest, I am rather baffled that there are critics who are hailing this film as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the if not the best superhero movies ever made. I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie they did. Even with that said, I still thought that this was a really good movie and I had a fun time watching it in the theater.Chadwick Boseman is quite good as the Black Panther, bringing the right blend of confidence and emotion to the character. There are many supporting characters who are quite interesting as well. I was skeptical about Michael B. Jordan playing the villain of the movie, but he did a surprisingly decent job.The best thing about this movie by far is its world-building. Wakanda is a wonderfully fleshed-out setting, and the gorgeous cinematography really sells the beauty and grandeur of it.The story is interesting and filled with intriguing commentary, with it only occasionally feeling preachy. The action scenes are a lot of fun, with the car chase being my favorite. I also liked the final battle.It does have some problems, though. The film dragged in some places and was overlong, and there were some instances where the CGI looked too obvious. The worst thing about this film by far is Martin Freeman's character. He had no real impact on the story and was kind of embarrassing to watch.All in all, this was another strong addition to the MCU. Even if it is overhyped and overrated, I still really like it. Check it out.RATING: B+"
BLACK PANTHER,15 April 2018,8/10,"I went into this film fully expecting to be underwhelmed; only because it had been hyped so much. Black Panther did something only the likes of Deadpool did - it impressed despite being built up as a phenomenal film. For those of you who aren't as deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as you'd like, let me first discuss what the film is about and who the titular character is. The first time we saw Black Panther was in Captain America: Civil War and like 50% of the characters, I didn't know a lot about him, but he stole every scene he was in, in that film. This film is his origin story, giving us a glimpse at the man (T'Challa) behind the mask and making us care and connect with the hero - something DC has been failing to do. Black Panther draws from the similar Lion King storyline, which in turn draws from the story of Hamlet; a king who is overthrown by a villainous counterpart, only to fight his way back to his rightful throne. That being said; it clearly isn't a shot for shot remake and blazes its own trail for the future Avenger. Black Panther is highly entertaining, straddling the line between action and character-driven storytelling brilliantly. Chadwick Boseman - who get this, is 41-years-old - feels as though he was born to play the leading role; becoming one of the most natural on-screen heroes since Chris Evans' Captain America. Andy Serkis reminded me of how good of an actor he is, even without CGI. The women - specifically Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o's characters - held their own playing heavy roles throughout the film. In a film featuring two strong male leads, they're able to display even larger feats of strength and power - Nakia is no Lois Lane. This film was the most well-cast film I've ever seen. I continuously said ""Oh I didn't know they were in this"" throughout the film after quickly being sucked in by their character. I can't say anything bad about any of the characters' including the token white character Ross played by Martin Freeman who has quickly become the new Agent Coulson - connecting all of the MCU films together and having a much larger role in this film. However, the person that stole the show was Michael B. Jordan. Jordan's Killmonger was outstanding, giving us the villain we didn't know we wanted and redeeming himself from his role in The Fantastic Four. Jordan is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors - have you seen Creed? You find yourself sympathizing with Killmonger throughout the film because he isn't your general good vs. evil villain. The reasoning behind his actions are understandable, delivering some of the most memorable lines from ""Can you believe that? A kid from Oakland walking around and believing in fairytales,"" to ""Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors what jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage."" A powerful character for such a powerful film, especially in today's racial climate. The bottom line for Black Panther is it's an entertaining film that features culture and something new for a Superhero film. I don't have an official list on hand, but I know Black Panther would be in the top five films for me in the MCU - possibly top three. Don't miss out on this soon to be classic."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"The fight for the crown of Wakanda is wonderfully brought to life in this bristling film about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and his rise to power as king of Wakanda in the aftermath of returning to his home country and his subsequent struggle for his position when he is challenged by his rival Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan in an authoritative performance) whose father was killed by accident by his father a generation earlier.First, the extraordinary visual effects. This sheer visual aspect of the film held my attention before I was sold on the film's underlying story. Even if you don't go for this sort of movie as a genre, you should nevertheless see it because its visuals demand being seen on screen. The film's stunning and lush realization of Wakanda alone is worth the price of admission.Then, there is the powerful story of two viciously competing visions for the place of Wakanda in the world and confronting injustice and oppression against its people. This film becomes a surprisingly gripping debate between confrontation and pragmatism, between vindictiveness and conciliation. Killmonger and T'Challa come to epitomize the conflicting philosophies battling for the leadership of Wakanda. In that regard, it's a great political Marvel film as well.I was impressed by how the whole cast gave this film so much vitality. Although Michael B. Jordan is somewhat underused in the beginning, his presence becomes more paramount and he shapes the film more and more as it goes along. Boseman is tremendously heroic and sympathetic in the title role. This is a Marvel blockbuster to remember when the dust settles. Strongly recommended."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,7/10,"I feel somewhere between a 6 and 7 on this one. The costumes, sets, and music are great, the action is good, but the script itself is a little wanting. Frankly, I could scrap the whole first 45 minutes of the film. Other than the action scenes the first 45 minutes are a bit flat, meandering, boring, and the story doesn't really begin until 45 minutes in. That's just bad scripting. I'm willing to forgive it's the same plot as the Lion King, 'cause it manages to be entertaining, but, it would have been nice if they'd stretched their imagination a bit further. There aren't many movies set in Africa, let alone commercial films, so, come on, give it a little more thought. The side characters, like his sister, girlfriend, main guard, and ally/adversary were the highlights for me. The Black Panther character was a bit...bland. Kind of like a boring Batman. Likable, but not much to him. The sister is the most likable. Honestly, I would have rather seen a movie about her. The women really steal the show in this film, along with the big dude from the neighboring tribe who challenges BP in the beginning.Maybe now that the world of BP has been set up the next one will be better? The writers don't seem to be particularly seasoned, so, I'm willing to cut them a little room, they just seem like they need to brush up on their plotting skills a bit. The whole, two bad guys thing just didn't work. It was like the first 45 minutes was practically a different film and totally unnecessary, other than the 3 minute scene to give the bad guy a reason for why he was bad. Other than that, the entire 45 minutes were utterly useless. The object they're trying to get ahold of isn't even relevant or necessary to the plot. All it does is lead the BP to the villains. In Raiders of the Lost Ark the Ark is relevant even until the last shot of the film which is why there is so much tension and it keeps you following along the whole way. The Wakanda axe was sort of like a weak Indiana Jones plot thrown in there that soon became irrelevant. If they cut out the first 45 minutes and tidied it up I probably would have given it an 8. That was the movie, the rest was just a loooong, drawn out filler. The female guards were awesome. The main one, and the whole battalion. I preferred them to the Amazons in Wonder Woman. Actually, throw the Wakanda women in a movie with Wonder Woman and the Amazons and I will totally watch that. I know, they don't do DC and Marvel crossovers, but that would really make the best of those two worlds. Okay, how about the Wakanda women and the Valkyries from Thor? There should be a good Marvel team-up of the ladies. Really, all the straight, white dude, superhero stuff is pretty stale. I only went to see BP 'cause the costumes and sets looked great and I had hopes, but wasn't exactly holding my breath given the way Marvel and DC just churn them out with only a few good ones that stand out from the mass of mediocre and bad.Anyway, worth a viewing in the theatre since this movie won't really hold up on the small screen."
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is about a guy who wants to become king of Uganda. There is only one problem another person wants to get the materials to the people of the U.S.Black Panther was great film. First, the music was awesome. They did the right type of music for this movie. It totally sounded like you where there. GCI was also amazing. It looked really real. It looked like it was really happening. Sound Effects were another key factor. It made the film seem alive. There were many animal effects or when one of the tribes came. The acting wasn't that bad either. Chadwick Bossman was a major piece to this movie. He was the best actor in the whole movie. I would say he is one of the best actors of the year. Also Michael B. Jordan was a great actor. He made for a perfect villain. Black Panther was a great movie. One of the best Marvel movies ever."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,9/10,"T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns as King to his homeland Wakanda. Wakanda is considered a third world country isolated from the rest of the world, but due to a meteorite that landed in Wakanda that contained Vibranium, the hardest metal in the Universe, the people were able to advance in technology and do not want to share their technology with the rest of the world for fear the Vibranium would be weaponized and constant wars would result. When T'Challa drinks a special herb affected by the Vibranium he gains superhuman powers and is known as the Black Panther. Okay, that's only half of the story that you need. The next half is that M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges King T'Challa and beats him in a King's Challenge and throws him over the waterfall and all believe T'Challa is dead; M'Baku wants to sell Vibranium to all countries to help the downtrodden peoples of the world have a chance at a better life and not caring about the consequences of wars among the countries.
 
So these are the 2-issues you need to focus on. There are some other issues, but you only need these two main ones. Oh, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) T'Challa's love interest wants Wakanda to share its technology with the rest of the world. T'Challa isn't too keen on this. The Hype this movie received is well worth all the publicity. The sets are outstanding, the fight scenes and plane battles are expertly choreographed as much CGI is incorporated. The acting all around is spot on. No doubt about it, this movie delivers. The only thing I had trouble with were the darkened scenes in the beginning. Then later at the end we see the fight between the NOW Two Kings and Black Panthers: T'Challa and M'Baku at the end as those scenes were very dark taking place in an underground railroad of sorts. Normally, in a movie like this there is some humor and here there is only one instance. When T'Challa's mother asks for help from another regional King to help defeat new King M'Baku, he gets annoyed and says he will feed these people to his children. Then he laughs and says, ""No that is not true as we are Vegans"" and he continues to laugh at his own joke. Notables: Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue; Martin freeman as Everett K. Ross, a CIA agent.Stan Lee makes an appearance at a casino craps table. He is now probably busy writing a sequel.There is very good heart stomping music throughout. The hype was good and the movie delivered and now we wait for the sequels. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Brief. Language: Brief soft stuff.
Rating: A"
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2020,9/10,"The african black superhero finally gets a movie. A family issue and two cousins fighting for becoming the king. Its all about the secret they have been hiding and should they share it with world or not. The complicacy a simple mistake unattended will do is clearly shown. How a single bad decision turns your whole world turtle. The family is united to all issues and which is I love about this movie. The brother and sister relation seems a real one. The endquote is awesome.
The technology they have makes Earth finally able to fight a bigger war which is what happens in Infinity War."

We need more movies like this. 10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,15 June 2018,1/10,"I am a comic collector in the veteran category. I'm also a movie buff. With the advent of the Comic revolution, you'd think someone like me would be in paradise. Best of both worlds right?Sadly - no. 
Only a handful of comic adaptions work. A very small handful. The suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. It's more basic than that. 
It seems we have a generation of fans willing to pan down the swill that Hollywood serves up like there's no tomorrow. 
Mindless action and CGI FX, take priority over characterisation, script, continuity and just plain substance. 
Added to that is the PC agenda. 
Added to that is the abject disrespect that Hollywood treats the original material and the creators of it with. 
I'm ashamed on behalf of the keepers of the flames. I'm downright embarrassed actually. 
Until fans lift their sights a bit and demand more, the studios will churn out rank movies that offer only superficiality and rake in the money. 
Nearly none of the movies are made by ""fans"". We know how great it can be when a fan directs a movie. Peter Jackson showed us with LOTR. 
Black Panther is trash. Pure and simple. Sorry."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"The highly anticipated superhero film ""Black Panther"" is finally here, after a ton of hype and outstanding reviews. While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make ""Black Panther"" feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.While there's undoubtedly much to like about ""Black Panther,"" the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile."

The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make ""Black Panther"" feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.While there's undoubtedly much to like about ""Black Panther,"" the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a film co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler. After a brief appearance in Civil War, I was very happy to hear this character getting a solo film. The trailers looked awesome and increased my expectations for it. Finally, after watching the film I can say that it was a great film.Plot: T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a long-time adversary, in a conflict with global consequences.Story and direction: Ryan Coogler was the perfect director for this film as he breathed new life in the MCU as he very nicely did it in the Rocky Series. The story very nicely intertwines the African culture along with the issues that every African American faces. This film is not the regular sueprhero film, which makes it stand apart from the rest. The characters of this film also make you glued to the screen. We have T'Challa who has a lot of responsibility not only as king but to the world also as a citizen. Then Killmonger, who also has a point in his statements but goes about it maybe in the wrong way. Which makes his villain mean something and stand-apart. Dora Milaje aspect was also great. The production values are enormous and it feels justified. Also the designs for Wakanda were awesome. It looked like a country that I would like to visit in the future. The background score was awesome. It further infused in the African Culture. Hats off to Ryan and team for the hard work put into this venture. The action scenes although minimal, were awesome and great. Where the film failed were the VFX. Considering that MCU have given great spectacles for almost 10 years now, VFX not being upto the mark is almost equal to a sin. Performance: Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa. The various shades of his character were perfectly acted by him. But the icing on the cake was Michael B Jordan. He pulled of the conflicted character with ease. People may not be wrong in saying of him being the best villain since Loki. Lupita N'yongo and Danai Gurira were earnest in their roles. Letitia Wright was quite the Q in this venture. Her comic timing was spot on. Daniel Kaluuya delivered a good performance.Winston Duke was great too. So was Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis proves that not is he only great at motion capture but also in real acting too. It was good to see Forest Whittaker and Sterling K Brown utilized nicely. And finally, Stan Le. No Marvel movie is complete without this genius.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where T'Challa comes to know about something in the past and shares his thought with Nakai. Then Nakai says that its upto T'Challa as to what kind of king he wants to be. This scene stuck with me as this showed even though Wakanda was the most advanced technologically but the people using it are humans.Verdict: Although it may not be the best of MCU, but it still is an enjoyabke and entertaining film for me. I had a great time with this film and yes, if you are wondering, I had to wait till the credits as there are post credit scenes in this film. Can't wait for Infinity War. I am going with a 9/10."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2019,7/10,"Black Panther was in my opinion overhyped by the media at release. This is in part because of it's nearly all black cast. First, the fight scenes for the throne have great visual effects and a great environment, however, those scenes are so over-exposed and take over the scene in my opinion. Our main character is unfun and he doesn't create any meaningful emotional bonds throughout the film. Not only is the main character not funny, but none of the jokes are; zero of the jokes hit. The movie has a really good pace and works well as a movie, but NOT as a superhero movie. As a hero, the Black Panther is one of the least epic heroes of the whole MCU. Because of his distinct lack of crazy abilities the ending cannot put him in any insane situations. Killmonger is a well-acted villain but has a master plan with very little threat. The distribution of weapons, while dangerous, does not hold the same weight as other superhero movies. Most hero movies have a villain who either threatens the lives of millions/billions immediately, or threatens the hero's family/friends. T'challa has no relationships to exploit and no big powers to stop the end of the world leaving the ending lackluster."
BLACK PANTHER,23 May 2018,8/10,"""Black Panther"" was definitely a novel treat, as it broke so many conventions. While not everything it did work, an generous amount of it did and did so in ways I did not expect. The movie definitely has a distinct visual style to present African culture. The cinematography was on-point, delivering vibrant scenery and fully captured the beauty of Wakanda. If I had to single out something that did not work for me, was the CGI. From the badly rendered rhino's to the video-game-like third act, it just didn't connect and at times was blatantly obvious. The performances were strong all-around. Chadwick Boseman got plenty of time to shine, and I was impressed by how much screen-time others, like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya had. Each character had an important role to play, and they did those roles proper justice in my opinion. A pleasant surprise was Martin Freeman as the unassuming CIA Agent Everett Ross. His role was a lot larger than I thought, and his attitude towards superheroes and the Wakandans built a fun rapport that made the story a little more dynamic. Now the villains. I will say this now, Marvel has probably created one of their most fun and most nuanced villain in a while. Andy Serkis's motion capture free Ulysses Klaue was just plain fun to watch as he brought a charming flair rarely seen in other antagonists. Michael B. Jordan was the one I was skeptical about at first, as the trailers did not properly set him up. His moral views and goals where very understandable and it is rare to see a villain so desperate and so rightfully justified in his actions. Even T'Challa was a changed man at the end of it all, which further supports Killmonger's actions. Last but not least, Kendrick Lamar and his curated hit songs may not have gotten a huge spotlight, but with the occasional beats delivered by him, Vince Staples, The Weeknd and others, along with Aftican tribal numbers all but helped add another layer. ""Black Panther"" bucked usual superhero conventions with its cultural insight, villains, atmosphere and strongly-written characters while also remaining very much grounded in the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,6/10,"With Disney setting the ground rules, we now know that Captain America gets the adult themes, leaving Black Panther and the others to tow the family with it. Unfortunately, one of the villains from the backstory isn't really quite Disney, so the film mixes a Bond lack of sentimentality at the beginning before going full Lion King at the end. The political points do hit home properly, but don't stay with you. The design and look of the film was as spectacular as sold, and mostly everything makes sense. It is this that will keep Black Panther going. There was a certain elan, which is missing from many other Marvel works. The afrofuturism provides an ever present thematic anchor.The film follows the 'first in franschise' template that states you must see lots of Wakanda and its denizens. Yet when it is slightly mysterious it is much better. Consequenly too much time is spent with the royal family and it feels like Thor in Asgard. The film was strongest away from there.At the end you can feel that this film was carefully guided down a safe path to protect it, but it could have done with less of that. Character development suffered because the Avengers gets all the good dialogue work. The final fight was the usual weakly choreographed fudge, a decades old format now. And the Black Panther is as strong in his mask as he is lightweight without it."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,1/10,"I love superhero movies although Marvel is not usually anywhere near the top of the list (I haven't seen the new Avengers yet), however...Read the user reviews and you'll get a better idea of what viewers actually think of this movie. The IMDB rating is waaaaaay off.It's a great idea but a poor script and flat acting lets it down. Oh - writer/director. Say no more...One annoying thing is the thick African accents which made some actors difficult to understand. Yeah, they're African but the accent turns them into stereotypes.Of positive note was Letitia Wright whose quips and generally joyous performance made you look forward to scenes she was in. Quite like the visuals and the tech, too.So another disappointing Marvel movie. These things cost millions to make. Can't they, PLEASE, hire a decent scriptwriter?"
BLACK PANTHER,25 August 2020,7/10,I saw the rating of this on rotten tomato it had 96% like seriously what were the critics smoking
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2020,7/10,"I can't fully accept all the negativity over this movie, nor the abundance of one star reviews that all pretty much state the same cliched reasons, no story, poor special effects. I didn't have an issue with either, the story was fine to me and the effects were great, I'm not sure what movie or what version a lot of these one star votes were watching, but it seems that the hatred is just clutching at straws. As is the other bugbear some have with the soundtrack, I mean really?I do feel that Black Panther was overrated and unnecessarily hyped but given the cast, the environment it's set in and the current political climate, particularly in the U.S, it was always going to be a vehicle for various agendas, so it was never going to be received as just another Marvel movie. Much in the same way that the O.J Simpson trial was never just another trial. However I easily looked past all that and just enjoyed the movie. I expected mostly black actors, it is set primarily in Africa as he is an African superhero, but according to some, they liked him better in Civil War rather than this. I guess that it's easier on the eye seeing a black actor surrounded by white people than the alternative in Black Panther. As for the humour, I wasn't aware that every Marvel movie had to be a laugh riot. They attempted that with Thor Ragnarok and people hated it, there was less humour in this and yet, people still hated it, so you're damned if you do and equally damned if you don't. There was enough humour in this to generate a few laughs in the cinema, so again, what version were a lot of these people watching? The car chase scene through the streets of Korea was great as well as entertaining and funny in parts, so I can't help but feel that people are voting this down for nitpicking reasons as opposed to their real reason, which ultimately wouldn't be allowed on IMDB.The one thing I do agree with is the lack of any real villain but it doesn't automatically make the movie boring, it fits in nicely with the rest of the MCU. Lets stop listening to overhyped and politically charged reviews, lower our expectations back to normal levels and enjoy these movies for what they are."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,,"Being the 18th film of the MCU and the last film before the highly awaited and anticipated Infinity War, Black Panther reintroduces the African based superhero (as he was introduced in Civil War) in his own solo film and boy was this one an unexpected surprise. I was suspecting the same routine that the previous films that we have seen, not to say that it's bad as I love Marvel regardless but it's director Ryan Coogler (Creed) has managed to bring a fresh coat of paint to the storytelling of the movie whilst delivering a style that is unique and beautiful.Firstly, the choice of the film's direction is great and promises to set new paths and future stories, but it's the tone of the film that showcases the race of black people as a culture that is unique and often referencing the racial issues that occur in reality but while being a superhero movie.
The acting cast are all strong, both the male and female roles in this film are used well, in particular with its villain Marvel have finally given us a villain that not only has a backstory but serves great as a threat with a purpose and isn't wasted at all. Michael B. Jordan (who had shined in Creed) plays this part with perfection and not since Spider-Man Homecoming have I seen a great villain to actually care for.Overall, Black Panther is a great entry in the MCU and it's one of the best films in the top 10 of the franchise as a whole. A strong director, solid performances, well written script, visually stunning style, great music score and great character development make the film a worthwhile treat for the fans and even the African American culture."
BLACK PANTHER,20 November 2018,8/10,"Firstly i am not someone whos life is in a book about superheros and I am not one that lives for it by waiting for the next chapter. I don't visit comicon or collect comics I am however a lover of films.This I didn't get to see at the cinema as I did for infinity war and ant man and the wasp so rented the DVD and I liked it. It wasn't as good as the last two in this series but standing along it was good. It had a solid objective and the story took us through that.A good cast and overall a well made film with the usual CGI effects, it lacked in making it more real by not having many normal earth scenes (buildings, normal people doing normal things) but a good print."
BLACK PANTHER,21 October 2021,10/10,"A very deep and political film, as well as a masterpiece in storytelling. Most likely, the best Marvel movie, and maybe, the best super-hero film out there. Everything about it offers perfection, the action, the dialogue, the scenery, and even the supporting cast. I have watched this one more than once and imagine watching it many more times to come."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,9/10,"In one of the most engaging MCU films to date. Black Panther's great casting, (Everyone) Beautiful set pieces, and costumes make the film stand out among all other superhero films. Coogler gives us a great superhero film, that's much more dramatic than previous MCU fare but also has lots of heart and a beautiful script to help it stand out. Some fans may find it a little standard, but you need to look past the surface. (as with all films) The Visuals for the film are very much CGI and it never looks to real on screen (much like Spider-Man) but if you can get past that you'll find there is enough sleak style to make the film stand out."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2018,7/10,"The good:
Chadwick Boseman
Michael B Jordan
Kick ass moves
The tech
The matching panther suitsThe not so good:
The story was weak
Black Panther spent most of his time avenging his father and then cleaning up his father's mess
Wakanda is so utterly unlikely I had trouble suspending disbeliefIt was watchable but far from my favorite Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,7/10,"Visually this movie is beautiful. There are some baffling choices left in. At one point they camera goes upside down trying to copy something similar they did in the last Thor movie. A very, very, very, VERY crappy blue screen effect when they go into the dream state. Those however stuck out because everything else was beautiful and stylized. I liked learning more about such a beautiful city where the old mixes with the new. I don't know how they even sustained it considering they don't trade with the outside so that mcguffin metal they have is just sitting there. Still it was nice to have this be about an entire civilization. They're way of life, politics and views. Not just one guy's journey to the throne.For that I think it's a good movie. It's not a great one however as the plot is flimsy at best and a lot of the scenes and actions make no sense what so ever. Killmonger specifically made zero sense and every scene with him was baffling. The conclusion is also a bit of the let down, it's what would have happened had nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, happened after the first 15 minutes of the movie. You could skip all that and ended up in the exact same place."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2020,9/10,"I thought this Movie was really Well Made, It Had a Strong Storyline, Great Characters and Performances, A Couple of Twists and Turns in the Storyline, Some Nice visuals and Most Importantly in this Movie, it Offered the Audience a Moral Dilemma.Things That made this Movie Great:¬∞ Chadwick Boseman and Michael B Jordan are the Absolute focus here and they put in Stellar Performances, Especially Michael B Jordan. General Okoye and Shuri are Great Too.¬∞ During a Certain Scene, it put The Audience on a bit of a See-Saw and made you think are they about to do what I think they are going to do? And they actually do it.¬∞ The Storyline was Excellently well done and it again Engages the Audience and Makes Them Really Think about the Dilemma and Make a Decision.¬∞ The Dilemma Had Two Roads and both of the choices would have Major Consequences. Do you go down the Road of Tyranny to do it? Or do you Risk Exposing and Ruining Everything you have to do it? It was A Very Tough Quandary.¬∞ The Action Scene in South Korea was Great¬∞ The Action Scene in Wakanda was Good¬∞ The Final One one One was Good and the Killing Blow was Excellently DoneIn the End it was Very Poignant, I felt Kind of Sad for Erik üòî, he had Conviction in what he Believed and you could Understand where he was Coming From.Great Movie"
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2018,6/10,"This movie is really not that great. I found it boring, action was mediocre, acting was good, similar story to many other movies (Lion King), and terrible CGi. Seriously, I don't know how a movie this expensive has such bad CGI? There is no weight or realism to the characters. They float like paper and when we have two CGI characters fighting, it looks about as good as a Playstation 3 cutscene. This movie doesn't really have a plot until the final act of this movie when Kilmonger comes into frame. It is cool that it shows us African culture, that was nice. Some of the comedy was funny, and I like the actress who plays his sister, She was good. Once again, all the actresses and actors were good in this. It is just that this movie was boring, bland, and very long.It doesn't add much to the Marvel cinema, and the action is really a huge letdown in this movie. The final battle makes no sense,like how a character just suddenly turns evil out of the blue. Michael Jordan is good in this movie, he has does say some of the deepest stuff in this movie. He talks about the enslavement of Blacks and how other Blacks just seem to forget to help their own people and become greedy. That was deep man, and he ends the movie with another quote that hits you hard, something like ""Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped off the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage."" He doesn't get much screen time so that kinda sucks, and his fight scene at the end with Black Panther was really bad. It reminded me of Spiderman when CGI characters fall while fighting. It looks really bad. His fight scene with the human Black Panther on the water fall was cool though.6/10 This isn't the best Marvel movie like some people claim it is. THe best Marvel movie is still The Winter Soldier. The worst Marvel movies so far are Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, & Dr.Strange."
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2021,2/10,"It's no surprise that Marvel movies are generally over-hyped and overrated. This one took it to another level. Sitting through this movie was a chore, every scene is a torment. The exaggerated African accent is unbearable to listen to. I find hard not to cringe every time one of the character started a speech out of nowhere. Nothing new in the special effects, it is as good as it ever was. One good thing about this movie is that finally Marvel made a superhero to represent the BDSM community. Just another over-hyped Marvel garbage, don't bother."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2020,5/10,"A bland, Marvel superhero flick that critics and audiences have escalated into something it's not, e.i., a ""long overdue"" and ""empowering"" movie."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,4/10,"I like Marvel films and really enjoyed seeing Black Panther in Civi'l War but this origin story for T'Challa was poorly executed.The story was poor, the world building ill conceived (advanced society with thatched huts next to skyscrapers and a feudal king), many of the characters flat out annoying or poorly written and a clear and regularly reinforced race agenda.I mean there is one scene where the token white guy starts talking and he's deliberately drowned out by black characters making monkey sounds (H&M anyone?) because his voice is not worthy because he's white.If there was any other Hollywood film where this example of racism happened, the director would include it to clearly signal to the audience that the perpetrator was a bad guy, a character that would get his comeuppance for being so openly racist. Yet not in this film. In fact he's portrayed as an individual coming to the rescue at the end and his racism simply laughed off. It's like this film was made 50 years ago with its tiresome cheap shots and endless chip on the shoulder rhetoric. It is a weak entry into the MCU and ranks alongside IM2, Thor 2 and Ultron as a Marvel dud.I have concerns about the impact of this film on Infinity War. I do have faith in the Russo's but capitulating to brainless dross to satisfy a rabid politically correct fan base isn't beyond any movie exec. Watching the IW trailer, it does look like they are fighting in Wakanda so are we really going to have to suffer the pinnacle of the last 10 years of MCU coming to a head in an ill conceived El Dorado just to satisfy a bunch of snowflake SJWs who are the last people that were buying into this glorious franchise.Just as the wait comes to an end, just as we top the crest of the hill to see the wonder of IW and it's huge assembled cast, are we really going to have to contend with a big chunk of it played out through the lens of this blatant weak link? Are we going to have to tolerate Cap and Stark playing second fiddle to this kind of nonsense? I can't deny that I'm a little worried.When we have seen what feminism, identity politics and piss poor writing and directing talent can do to Star Wars and a Marvel tentpole, are we not fearful that all of our longing will be dashed on the rocks of a studios needing to signal its moral virtue."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,"Much as Wonder Woman is unlikely to significantly improve gender equality, I also doubt Black Panther will have a long-term impact on racial equality. Maybe each showing for Black Panther could be pre-empted by a showing of I am Not Your Negro, although that documentary is miserably lacking in the explosions and stabbings which fill Black Panther.There are a lot of fights in Black Panther, a lot of them where light is lacking, making the whirlwind attacks difficult to parse, confusing to discern, and baffling to ingest. There are calls to action coupled with critiques of isolationism, a couple of astral projections, and several Black Panthers. With the Q-like Shuri helping improve tech gadgetry, a better title might have been Vibraniumfinger.Black Panther lacks the fun of other Marvel fare like Deadpool or Spider-Man: Homecoming, maybe intentionally so, with awkward jokes peppered in a just the wrong moments, trying to bring light-heartedness into dire situations and uncomfortable realities. If the world outside is one of unjustly oppressed people, the world inside is only as just as the strongest, most enlightened, and physically fittest autocrat.We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact, and there are definitely things They do not want Us to know."

BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,4/10,"The deluge of Marvel movies starts to be a little tire. Massive super hero movies are mainly so bare empty. In this category Black Panther makes no exception. It doesn't differentiate any way between all grandiloquent Marvel movies. Concept it self is quite ok, but the story itself is so boring and lame. Technically Black Panther is well done and it looks great on screen, but use of 3D is just nonsense. Even it is great to see a superhero movie with just black actors, the conclusion feels too underline and pointing, which hardly is what the makers wanted.Movie also feels too vain and clearly it has just made to underlay upcoming Avengers movie. It only purpose is to introduce new character to audience, so they don't have to do it at Avengers movie.Black Panthers massive budget of 200 million dollars gives you some beautiful scenery but nothing else. Stan Lee makes his cameo in this movie and that feels the most funniest part of the movie.Visually Black Panther is guaranteed Marvel production. As a brisk action movie it finds it's audience for sure, but at Marvel universe it is incorrigible tail end."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2018,,"It is definitely an action packed movie with an interesting story and a few plot twists. I thought it will be boring to watch it with this ""African"" culture, but in reality it is a mix of African and artificial culture, which kind of shows what African countries could have looked like if they had enough wisdom to create their own cultures like asian or european countries did. So it is interesting to watch this made up country with perfect technology, kind of Atlantida or something. Another reason why it was interesting to watch it was because of MARVEL. Their directors can make even a dumb idea look good, so it was indeed interesting. 
Anyways, it is probably one of the weakest Marvel movies in the recent years, even though the story is quite good, but I don't regret watching it, even though it is not really connected to any other Marvel movies.
Andy Serkis was great and as always, it's always good to not watch trailers to have surprises like this."
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,3/10,"Yes, the CGI in this movie is pure excellence. That's all I can say on the positive side after yawning through this dreadful Marvel story. I love superhero films but this one made little sense. Firstly, how can such an advanced civilisation remain hidden in Africa for so many centuries? It would have been more believable were it set deep within the Amazon for example.I was very disappointed to see Forest Whitaker's type cast performance as he might as well have been playing in The Last King of Scotland. The main actor was, in my opinion, badly chosen. I think Michael Jai White would have pulled it off better. The strongest performance from was by Michael B Jordan ( Creed main actor ). I know superhero stories are meant to be fantastical but this one just didn't make any sense to me. The movie was disjointed, the script weak, the acting average and the characters were not likeable or well described. Perhaps they just focused on the CGI without bothering to concentrate on the script, story or acting."
BLACK PANTHER,10 November 2019,1/10,"The early '70's gave us the Blaxploitation genre, and while most of those movies were really bad, they made up for it with attitude; those movies knew how to carry themselves (see William Marshall taking a goofy idea like Blacula and really selling it and even bringing dignity to the character). Those movies, even at their worst, had an indelible swagger. This, this is just a neutered pandering. Disney is trying to compensate for a century of dumb cartoons (Song of the South) targeted at a race with a dumb cartoon targeted at a race. The movie tries too hard without taking any chances - King T'chala is a PC Shaft for 10 year olds who don't know who Shaft is. This movie feels more patronizing than empowering. Empowering is seeing Jim Kelly in Three The Hard Way, Kung-Fu kicking the s**t out of a squad of cops in slo-mo. Here we have Americans and Englishmen doing African accents (I don't even know if they're accurate) in an idealized fantastical version of Africa where they're the most advanced because they happened to get an all-purpose element. The CGI is horrid. The premise is the ages-old half-siblings struggle over a throne. The Blaxploitation movies at least had a black authenticity to them - this is just empty weightless pixels."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,10/10,"So i had read a lot of positive things about this movie from professional, and a mixture of negative, and not so positive remarks from others. So I decided to forget all that, when i went to see the movie.
I believe the critics were right. This is a wonderful movie. it.s totally deserving of 
every bit of praise it gets. It looks terrific. Top marks to costume and production design. it has good acting. although let's be honest, Andy Serkis steals the movie. But i suppose, anyone who gives as loud a performmance, as he does was going to be noticed. But as brought up when introducing the main villains, it's not the first time, whites have stolen from blacks. i also liked that the movie wasn't afraid to have some quiet moments of people just talking. Yes, there some cheesy moments. See challenge number one, and scene after some of the end credits. But overall, wonderful."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2019,8/10,"Is it overhyped? Probably.
Is it well executed? Very.
Is it a meaningful addition to the Marvel Universe? Quite so, yes, but not necessarily for the reasons you'd expect at first.
Should you watch it? Certainly!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 November 2018,5/10,"I'm sorry but black panther is a boring movie that had a very uninteresting plot, and this is coming from me who is a mixed raced man. To make a long story short, just because I don't like the movie that does not make me a racist, which is what most people tend to say to the people who don't like the movie. Well, I'm sorry guys but you're wrong. The people who don't like this movie have MANY REASONS why they don't like it and NONE of those reasons are to do with race. I personally didn't like the movie because I thought it was boring as hell! It was so boring in fact that I had a hard time understanding why most people like this movie more than Age of Ultron!Can someone explain to me why this movie is better than Age of Ultron??? It's NOT BETTER IT'S WORSE. Age of Ultron is a Great Movie! And it is Action packed from start to finish!. The Action in that movie is insanely entertaining! And my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. The story was entertaining, the characters were great, and in my opinion, Ultron was great! Yes, I said it, Ultron is a Great Villain. I honestly would put Thanos in first place and Ultron in second place and then Loki in third place when it comes to best villains. Yes I know I have probably made people angry by saying that but it's my opinion and I won't change it. Those three are the top Marvel Villains in my opinion and they would all kick killmongers Ass Easily. Yes, I am also one of the few people who thinks the Killmonger Villain is overrated. Killmonger is one of the biggest problems I have with the black panther movie, the guy was all talk and no action. Do the people who like this guy not realize that?This guy wins one fight and he thinks he's king of the WORLD! Give me a break!!! What's so impressive about that???
Ultron could kill this guy in five seconds!!. Also, Ultron nearly destroyed The WORLD! I think that fact alone makes him a better villain than killmonger!. I will be very surprised if anyone agrees with me on that. They probably won't because they know The truth hurts.The fight black panther has with killmonger was nothing special either, it was okay at best, but black panther got beaten way too easy in my opinion. Also, this is supposed to be a movie about black panther and black panther doesn't even do that much in his own movie! Which is weird considering the title of the movie is Black Panther!.And don't get me started on Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue! He was even more Lame than killmonger was!. His acting was over the top and ridiculous! And he spent The whole movie acting like he was high on Crack!. When the man started singing I face-palmed myself because of the Stupidity I was watching and hearing!. He is definitely one of the worst marvel villains ever!. Ultron already kicked his ass once! And then black panther kicks his ass again! Easily.If anyone is reading this review they are probably very mad at me by this point which doesn't surprise me either. I'm sorry folks but I have to be honest, and I honestly think this is an overrated movie!. The things most people find impressive about it I don't find impressive at all. 1 The story. What story?? The movie barely has a story!. 2 The bad guy killmonger being one of the best villains. I disagree with that %100 He is actually one of the WORST Marvel villains as well as one of the most generic villains ever!. There is simply nothing special or scary about him and he has no substance. I found him to be a run of the mill villain. Loki would destroy this wannabe in a fight Easily. I'm sorry but I don't see how I can be wrong about that, and furthermore, I'm not the only person who likes Loki, a lot of people like Loki and I'm sure they would agree with me about Loki kicking his ass.Now getting to number 3. People say the villain is sympathetic. I'm sorry but I disagree once again. I don't understand why most people are showing sympathy for a man who wanted to commit genocide!!!. He nearly strangled a woman to death! And he spoke about wanting to rule the world! Even if that meant killing innocent women and children!!!. So how is this man sympathetic??? HE'S NOT!. Killmonger was a psycho! Who was way too cocky for his own good, and it was his cockiness that made him lose the fight at the end of the movie. The only time I felt slightly bad for him is when he spoke about how his dad was killed in the past. Yes that IS sad I will admit that, BUT That doesn't justify GENOCIDE!!!. It's not the world's fault your dad was killed, it was black panthers dad who killed him, but since he's dead, I guess the only people he can be angry with are black panther and his tribe. But once again, being angry at black panther is one thing but wanting to commit GENOCIDE IS ANOTHER!!!. I should also point out Black panthers dad only killed killmongers dad in (self-defence) because he tried to kill black panthers uncle, so by law, the killing was justified. Even though killing was justified I can totally understand why killmonger would be sad about THAT. However, wanting to rule the WORLD because of it is totally RIDICULOUS!. Sigh, and people call Ultron Lame!?? Ultron is NOT lame, Killmonger is Lame!. Killmonger had a totally dumb reason for wanting to rule the world and he was a lame villain because of it.
I did not feel any sympathy for killmonger %95 of the time. The movie wants us to feel bad for him but most of the time I didn't. I'm sorry but when you threaten to kill thousands of people, my sympathy for you goes out the window.The ending fight between black panther and killmonger was terrible too. The fight was lame and badly edited with terrible special effects! I felt like I was watching two guys fighting inside a video game! And it looked Awful. That fight was very disappointing and I expected a lot more from it considering it was the final fight!. Black Panther also got his ass kicked a second time, and he only won the end fight because he was able to grab a knife and stab killmonger, and even that was done in a very lame and unsatisfying way. Then he shows sympathy to the bad guy after he stabs him just because they are cousins!?. He did not deserve any sympathy in my opinion, not after all the people he killed, and everything else he did! Not to mention the fact that he tried to kill black panther too!There are many other things people praise this movie for too like it being the first ever black superhero movie. Sorry folks but Blade beat you to it!. Wesley Snipes is Black and his blade movies are better than this movie. Another movie that has a black lead that is the hero of the movie is Predator 2. Danny Glover kicked more ass in predator 2 then black panther did in this movie! And that movie is nearly thirty years old!! And it's a better movie than this movie!!. You also have pitch black and the chronicles of Riddick and Event Horizon, those movies are all better than black panther. They may not be superhero movies but they all have mixed raced and black people as the main characters. I love those movies and I love those characters. I like those characters more than black panther, and they all kicked more ass than black panther did too.Black Panther is a movie that just has problem after problem after problem. I've seen black panther twice now, and after seeing it the second time around it has Not held up well, in fact, I found it way worse the second time around and even more boring the second time around. The only things I liked about this movie were a few fights, a few okay effects and two of the female characters. I liked black panthers sister Cherry I thought she was likeable and funny and I liked the bald lady Okoye. I thought she was cool and the most badass person in the whole movie! (Don't attack me I'm not a feminist, I just happened to like her) She actually fights very well, and I enjoyed her fight scenes in the club and I liked the few fights she had at the end of the movie with cherry helping her. Cherry fights pretty good too.Sadly that's where the positives End because I can't think of anything else I liked in the movie. The acting is not the problem with this movie, the acting was okay from everyone except Andy Serkis, he sucked. The directing was bad and the writing was terrible. The movie was way too slow and did not have enough action. The movie had a script that lacked action, thrills, originality and good storytelling and overall the movie just ended up being an Average cliched and forgettable run of the mill movie.I definitely don't recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 June 2018,4/10,"This movie is an average action movie, so I would rate it approx 6. But just because people give it way overrated score, I will add low score just to be one of those sane mind reviewers, who wants to see a moce get an deserved rating. All the hype abput this movie being ""out of this planet"" got me so entusiastic to watch it, that I just could not wait. And now... My goodness! Are you all kidding with this way overrated score? This movie is nothing more but an average action movie with bit of a story to it. Even acting is average. Not bad, but average. I guess it is true when they say it is political agenda behind this almost fully black cast. Movie is ok, it is not as Godly as they make you wana think it is, it has nothing profound to offer nor it is some cinematographic masterpiece.Would I recommend it for a nice movie night? Yes, sure, because it os action packed with some good sceenery and stuff. Would I say it is something profound and touching, thought provoking and lifechanging experience? My God no, far far from mindblowing. Just an average action movie, made with mostly black cast due to the Africa-themed script and that's just about it. All the political stulidity behind it is nothing but false, undeserved hype."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,1/10,Have seen in Netflix for first time I never usually watch superhero hero movie ever since I heard of this movie buzz thought of let give it a try and have to say at the end fight visual effects gets horrible starting was good then don't know what this turn too I guess people are overhyped it bcuz of culture but I guess having read most of review I agree that this is piece of trash.
BLACK PANTHER,3 April 2019,7/10,Don't get me wrong...it IS a good movie but it's NOT a great movie and has been completely overblown and overrated. Whoever thought this should have won an Oscar for Best Picture couldn't have been more wrong.
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2021,7/10,"#MCUrewatch. The strengths of Black Panther are quite obvious: the traditional African setting, score and rituals (in the eyes of us Westeners) mixed with the tropes of the MCU. It is a refreshing take on a by now familiar superhero story. The thematic references to slavery and racism are nice touches to a comic book story. The fictious world of Wakanda is interesting in the details and the backstory of villain Killmonger makes him one of the more nuanced bad guys. Great performances by Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright. But Chadwick Boseman is not as charismatic as Downey Jr or Pratt. Michael B Jordan is more impressive (sorry you Boseman fans). In the final analysis Black Panther is a refreshing take on a typical superhero tale."
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2021,7/10,Pretty decent movie not my favorite tho but I really like the character black panther and his suit looks good GCI scene at the end was kinda bad but still pretty decent movie liked killmonger a lot.
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2019,1/10,Very disappointed with this movie. There is no plot. It was cheesy and predictable. I watched this on Netflix and I'm glad it wasn't on the big screen.
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,7/10,"When I first saw Black Panther, I thought it was good, but not much better than your average superhero movie. After thinking about it some more, I can genuinely say that Black Panther is a really good film. It's exciting, the cast is great, the jokes are relevant, and the characters are all genuinely likable and written very well. I loved the idea of Wakanda being hidden from the rest of the world, the bend of African culture and high-tech gadgets, and the design of the city. You can tell that the makers of this film really put a lot of thought into it.Black Panther is a film worthy of the hype it has received. It's a cultural phenomenon with a killer soundtrack, a fantastic cast, and great world building. It's a strong 8 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2018,,"Crapfest from the first glimmer to the last fade to black, this is a movie you would be proud to throw on the barbecue just to see it melt and dissolve into a gluey mess -- much like its plot, its dialogue and its acting.Back in the late 60s, Black Panther was great. By the time this rolled out of the monstrosity that has become Disney, it turned into a racist mashup of political correctness that relied too heavily on fake ""african"" accents, fake ""Afrikaans"" accents and thug life posing by Killmonger. Back in the those long-gone decades, Panther was a bad ass. This movie shows him as being weak and unworthy of wearing the Claw Necklace.Hopefully, the film will go the way of the LAST Fantastic 4: forgotten and stillborn.One positive note, the special effects were on the money. The rest of it was unfortunate. I gave it a five just in case you thought I was going trash it."
BLACK PANTHER,11 August 2020,6/10,"RIP Chadwick Boseman - WAKANDA FOREVER!Okay, I LIKE BLACK PANTHER; I've seen it more than a handful of times, but this film is not perfect, by any meaning of the word! The hype around this film, almost gave it an impenetrable force-field for negativity. Coogler and the creative team set themselves up for a lot of clear nitpicks, due to the predictability, extra dose of plot armor, and a decent amount of plot gaps and filler. With Ryan Coogler being one of the best up and coming directors in the game, he didn't really impress me here, but he still kept that Marvel vibe going, while adding in a lot of his own spices, sprinkled throughout the film. He made this more of a stand-alone film, but he tied in some nice, subtle references from the saga. Coogler utilized this huge cultural aspect, that worked well with the film's premise, while not jamming it down your throat, every opportunity they got. The issue with the premise; Yeah, it may have had a few enjoyable moments, and interesting ideas, but it felt exactly like The Lion King, just in a superhero format. The way that Ryan Coogler structured and placed the scenes, just didn't flow right, having a real choppy pace, making it feel like two different films, on some occasions. With just a couple of scene swaps, I feel like this film would've already been that much better. With the pace being one of the couple downfalls of the film, it brought the twist aspect of the film drastically downward, considering it was presented very sloppy and forceful.Sarah Finn had her hands full, again, by casting this wonderful group of talent. All of the characters were really fun, bringing all their A-games to the big screen, but the creative team had a tough time trying to balance everyone. One of the biggest issues of the film, is that the Coogler and Cole did their best to make everyone equally important, but it doesn't carry much weight, because you lose a lot of the value in the main characters, that we should be worried about, so when it comes to a high stakes moment, that feeling gets somewhat diminished. Chadwick Boseman is a fine protagonist, that's easy to root for, due to his backstory, with a great heart and wits, but he can get kind of boring and bland at times. He has more than enough to do, but he doesn't do much at all, until the final act. His character development was very predictable, and fast paced, by the end of the film, it doesn't really feel like we know that much more about him. With how his character is written aside, Boseman puts on a really good performance as T'Chala/Black Panther, fitting the Avengers like a glove. With Letitia Wright as Shuri, having the best chemistry with Boseman, she was one of the most entertaining characters, the film had to offer. Although she was nothing more than a plot device, she was a really nice addition, bringing some fun laughs, and great wit to the film. Danai Gurira was another great addition to the film, bringing this amazing women power feel. She was an excellent compliment to everyone, while serving her purpose well. Danai Gurira may have overcooked her performance just a little bit, but she was one of the best additions to the film. Lupita Nyong'o was the biggest disappointment of the film. Nyong'o is one of the best actresses in the game, but her character was written so poorly, being one of the biggest wasted potential of the film. Her character had a lot to offer, but due to insignificant writing, her character felt unconnected. Forrest Whittaker, Angela Bassett, Winston Duke, and Martin Freeman all had their own things to do, fitting their roles nicely, but they were all used strictly as plot devices. We finally got another taste of Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, and he stole every scene that he's in! While not having the most screen time, he made the most out of it, serving his purpose really well! Our main antagonist of the film, being one of the best villains on the MCU, is Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. Every single time he's in frame, he brings this dominant presence, being a real savage and memorable villain. The screenwriters did a great job fleshing out his motive, making it easy to get behind his character, and somewhat understandable why he's doing what he's doing. The only issue I had with his character, I just needed more of him. If they added little sprinkles of him through the long duration of when he wasn't around, it would've made things a lot more tense and exciting.The screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole did a pretty decent job overall, but there was a few holes that needed some patching up. The way they attacked the emotional aspect of the film, just didn't click right with the premise, feeling pretty weak, and dry. The humor was here and there, but it thankfully wasn't over saturated, because it wouldn't have worked with this film.One of the best things about this film, is the production. Coogler crafted these beautiful scenery shots, with so many bright colors that just pop off the screen at all times. This is one of the prettiest films the MCU has released, on the side of Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange.The action was really just okay. They had some fun combat scenes, but the overwhelming amount of CGI, almost completely threw me out of the film. The CGI was just super clunky, with a lot of pieces that looked unfinished. The score and soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, was really enjoyable. It fit really well with the scheme of the film, enhancing every scene that it is included in.Overall, I do not hate Black Panther, but this film definitely has more than enough flaws to be talked about."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,7/10,"""Black Panther Down"" is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his ""I don't care"" attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last ""Thor"" movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here. I'll applaud them for going to new places. But the end result didn't stick out to be more than mainly a fun time with popcorn at the movies.I would have probably changed the visual style more if I was the one making it. Can they use less green-screen next time, please? It's Africa! I wanna see the savannas and the fantastic nature sights. There's an over-reliance of just resorting to fake digital backgrounds rather than using real locations. The digital gloom over everything lessened the visual appeal for me. But, hey! That's just the look. How's the story? Yeah, it's decent. I liked the grounded stuff mixed with African culture and/or mythology. The Wakandan technology and civilization was jarring to me at first sight. Not even Tony Stark has that level of tech. It was too much of a future city for my taste. Although the question of why the Wakandan tech has never been heard of before is brought in the movie as a major plot point. So I thought it was nice that it was addressed. The characters are fun and everyone brings a nice charisma to the screen. Chadwick Boseman, Lupita NYong'o and Forest Whittaker give their absolute care to the movie. It's no paycheck day for sure. It feels like Martin Freeman basically just hanged around on set. I was happy to see him there though. Because he would see and react to Wakandan culture like we, the audience would. The villains are good, but like in most previous Marvel films; they get sidelined again. Andy Serkis brought a fantastic personality to his mischievous guy, but his screen-time is limited. That was an unwise choice. Michael B. Jordan (AKA Creed) is also very interesting and unique. Not very often these days when you can understand the villain's motive so well. The main group are, like I mentioned, good and all.. But, the biggest problem I have is that the story line goes to all the expected places. It's pretty much like ""we've done all of this stuff before"". I wasn't surprised by where the plot ended up going because it's usual business and all so going through the familiar beats. It would have been more fun with some different twists. The action is entertaining. You even get a ''Skyfall''-like casino scene, but with some additional slow-mo fighting, of course.Did I care for the story? Sure. There are neat moments and a fun adventure with good heroes to root for. None of it was captivating enough to raise my enjoyment unfortunately. I could see the emotional things and what they were trying to do. But, I didn't feel it. Black Panther is a superhero I've known almost nothing about. That's the reason I decided to go in as blank as I could. I would have loved to have been surprised, but I got a fun action movie with like-able heroes instead. Ultimately the character is sort of a mix of ""The Phantom"" and ""Batman"". I'm a fan of both those two and if you haven't read the Phantom comics, then I would highly recommend them. I wanted to see more of the tone you'd read there. It's grounded, but it feels a little fantastical too. The jungle is dark and mysterious. Filled with many legends and roads to unknown adventures. Well, I think my review has ended up too long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm sure Black Panther can become even better down the line, if there's more focus on delivering something less predictable and maybe more personal. Oh, and delve into the mythology and the mysticism more next time. It did what it had to do; to entertain and make audiences feel familiar with Wakanda. Now my thought is that ""Infinity War"" better deliver. Show me what 10 years of this Cinematic Universe has been leading up to. Do not play it safe, please. Any way, ""Black Panther"" was fine. It's a good time, but it should have had more weight."
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2018,8/10,"The great characters, action and setting make 'Black Panther' an extremely enjoyable Marvel film and one of the MCU's best. The film is always entertaining, bolstered by an amazing score by Ludwig G√∂ransson that really captures the essence of the flick, and the self-contained story feels refreshing as it's never concerned with setting up further films, only being good in its own right. While the plot is quite predictable, the writing ensures that the audience always care about the characters and are invested in the narrative, leading to one of the more engaging stories of the MCU. The film is also definitely an ensemble piece, and, as good as Chadwick Boseman is in the role of T'Challa, it sometimes feels like the eponymous 'Black Panther' is outshined by the outstanding characters that surround him. That's certainly not a bad thing though, as it means that every major character has their own moment to shine - including T'Challa himself, who gets several of the film's best moments. Although the CGI looks unfinished in some of the action scenes, risking a disconnect between the characters and the audience, the action is always enthralling - a stand out being the entire South Korea sequence - and this is in part due to how invested we are in the story and how much we care about the characters. Overall, 'Black Panther' is an always entertaining superhero flick, with fantastic characters and action, that ranks as one of the MCU's best to date. 8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,7/10,Amazing movie the action the emotions every thing but very bad ending dispointing
BLACK PANTHER,26 July 2020,3/10,"Admittedly, I only watched this movie because it was on my list of Oscar winners for 2019 (best original score, best production design), not because I am a fan of superhero movies, but I still harbored the distant belief that it might be a hidden gem in disguise.Unfortunately, it was only a fraction of a percent better than Suicide Squad, which was also diabolical, for a number of reasons:The plot! So Africa has a super-advanced country hidden under the forest that no-one knows about, which is able to make incredible alien technology beyond anything ever seen before, without any ability or need to import raw materials to build production plants and laboratories, including Apple-esque glistening-white research centers?In fact, I am more angry about watching this film today then I was yesterday when it finished.And the totally embarrassing scene in which the white man was not allowed to talk in the company of the ""ape king"", which I quote from another character, including ape chanting and stomping sounds, which was supposed to be funny? It was horribly embarrassing, and I can only deduce that this scene was included for cheap laughs in the black community, much like the cheap laughs in The Patriot against the English 'tyrants', although The Patriot wasn't a totally bad film.It's quickly becoming the same old scenario in modern-day superhero movies: everything seems made up as it goes along because it can be hidden away behind special effects.And I totally get the need for black inclusion, which is one of the reasons I watched this movie, but it was instead patronizing to black people and included inverse and bizarre racism and parodies as well, causing Black Panther to badly misfire alongside its dull plot."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"You would be hard pressed to find another 2018 film that has as much cultural and societal significance as Black Panther. A giant blockbuster comic book film, with a (nearly) all black cast, black writers, and a black director. If you have ever questioned whether representation on screen is truly important, just look at the philanthropic movements surrounding this movie. With the ""Black Panther Challenge"", money is being raised so that black youths--who could not afford to see it themselves--can go watch the film. The amount of love surrounding this movie almost matches the film's own innate messages, and it shows just how powerful the medium of film can be. This is exactly why movies are made. So while we take the time to discuss and analyze the film, it's important to have this preface of the significance of this movie, as that is far more important in the long run than all the tiny details and Easter Eggs Marvel fans will pick apart and debate. With that said, Black Panther is a really great movie. It personally is not in my top five Marvel Cinematic Universe movies like it is for some people, but it is a great film that stands out as being one of the more unique entries into the MCU, mainly due to Ryan Coogler's direction..."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,3/10,"A real snoozefest. I knew 10 minutes in that this was going to be a stinker. Another 30 minutes and I'm thinking, is this a super hero action movie, or a slow drama. So much of what I want to say has been said already, including the painful length of this thing.As usual IMDB has faked the ratings. Look through the reviews, see how many high scores there are. Not many, right? Yet it still maintains that too-high score, and we all know why. What kills me is the presumptuousness of the left to claim we have NO RIGHT to give this a bad rating. That we are REQUIRED to give it 10 stars. Sorry, but you have to earn that, and this movie did not.I also think it's hilarious that the hole point of the panther is to keep foreigners out of his country. Hahaha!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 October 2018,6/10,"A nation wherein everything from the trains to buildings is made of the most powerful element in the cosmos, the vibranium. This is just amazing to think. Moreover, the technologies like the Magnetic Levitation trains, the holographic technologies like visual driving are first time introductions in Hollywood. The graphics, in the way the tribes are shown, the waterfalls are all mesmerizing.
The poor part is the story and the direction. The entire story is somewhat boring and unconnected where you are not in charm to watch the next twist as it seems so predictable. Moreover, the exaggerated acting of Shuri kills while watching. The direction was below average as a brilliant story was presented in an average manner.
This movie had many new elements that could have been capitalized to produce a brilliant fantasy but the opportunity seems to have been missed. Let's see what this has to offer in the Avengers series."
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,2/10,"How sad . . . I was truly looking forward to a uniquely crafted film experience, but no matter how much I wanted to have that experience, it just wasn't there.Much effort was devoted to the sets, aesthetic motifs, and beautifully outfitted actors. As a plotless visual artpiece, it had its moments. Beyond that, it was an embarrassingly silly attempt at a story, filled with mono-dimensional cliched characters.I can appreciate the cultural concept that was being attempted. In that context, this could have been a spectacular opportunity for the Marvel franchise, but it was sadly missed.To say this production was a disappointment would be more than an understatement. That it actually ended up on Netflix so soon after its run in the theaters is an appropriate assessment of this unfortunate missed opportunity for something that could have been so much more.For visual aesthetic, it deserves 2 stars . . . but beyond that, not much can be said for this unfortunate production."
BLACK PANTHER,23 August 2020,10/10,"This film is amazing watched in imax 3d. I watch most comic book movies this way for the last ten years,black panther is on another level for a standalone film the action affects story pacing brilliant never bored once. I wanted to watch it straight away again the only better marvel movie is the original avengers and logan but that isn't really marvel. Trust me don't listen to all the haters and watch this film I'm going to watch it again and I haven't done that with a film since the matrix enough said long live the KING."
BLACK PANTHER,30 May 2021,7/10,The world building is fantastic. The villain is also very good. The acting is very good. The story is okay. In some parts the movie has terrible CGI.
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2021,10/10,"I can't believe how good this movie was. It isn't the best Marvel movie ever made, but it is definitely up there. DO NOT listen to everyone who is saying this movie was overhyped, and overrated, this was a great movie that deserves recognition. I liked just like Spider-Man: Homecoming, they were able to tie this in with Captain America: Civil War. This one wasn't as direct as Homecoming was, but it still had the reminiscence of what happened during Civil War. I still find it hard to believe that this movie was the only Marvel movie to win at the Oscars, and what it won for definitely deserved it. It won best achievement in music, best achievement in production design, and best achievement in costume design. The score for this movie was absolutely phenomenal, Ludwig G√∂ranson is amazing. Whatever music he does for tv or movies is always great. His work on the Mandalorian was some of the best I have ever seen. The Black Panther score in my opinion was the best in the MCU so far. I don't know why Marvel Studios doesn't invite him to do more for them. This movie also won best achievement in production design. I 100% agree. They way they made Wakanda look was phenomenal, and the sets they used for scenes like the Ancestral Plane, the Garden of the Heart Shaped Herb, the ritual combat arena, and M'Baku's throne were breathtaking. Shuri's lab was also pretty cool. Lastly this movie won an Oscar for best achievement in costume design. The wardrobe for this movie was great, the way everyone was dressed in what they definitely made look like a traditional African wardrobe was great. Also, the Black Panther and Killmonger suits were so cool. No only was this movie good for all that, it also had a great plot, an even better story, and amazing acting. I was blown away once again at how well the people Marvel casts can act in their roles.I 100% recommend watching this movie, it is great all around, and it never gets old.R. I. P Chadwick Boseman
Wakanda Forever."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,7/10,"One seriously don't go into this film think its a racially motivated film, if you're looking for this to fuel some anger and use it as a political standpoint to fuel a race war then you need to check your moral campus, because this film is completely opposite on political views which address a lot of the world issue not just in Wakanda, some of which that were mention in this film I agree with.But I'm not gonna spend the whole of this review explaining the political side of this film, although most of these motive from T'Challa played brilliantly by Chadwick Boseman show a man seeing the past mistake of his ancestors and wanting to make the world a better place through help each other and become as one tribe there for each other. But know that its ok to help each other but the world has its issue that it must overcome in order to bring peace and help each other, me person not even reading or know anything about the comic books of black panther, watching this film I understood his motives and passion, not just for his own people but to help the world as well.If you never read any of the comic books this film does do a great job in giving black panther a backstory while helping you understand his character and motivate. I personally love the lion king style reference which was a nice touching moment for this film with the animal spirit guides.although the film doesn't really represent Wakanda as Wakanda is a fictional place based on the nation in Africa like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and the Congo more like an amalgamation of these real African nations, economies, and cultures.Which is represented in trial by combat for leadership and the woman shown as strong African warriors kind of like the amazons which is shown perfectly in the film with Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira playing these role along with ladies playing warriors There is also a few moment where we get some funny moment which does overdo it like most other Marvel films have done in the past.Even the whole casting is pretty good in this film along with its acting but it does suffer a lot of problems, not that this is a bad film, there are a few things that make this a pretty average film and not a perfect one. By far out of all the Marvel villains Micheal B Jordan is best so far in having a true motive to be evil but with one flaw in his story playing Erik Killmonger. With the mention of this black panther being the James bond of the comic book universe I would say total true on that part with Letitia Wright play a technology expert like Q from Bond films, so in a way, that reference is true which actually works.Although this of what I said is all the good parts of the film, there is a lot of issues the film has which will be addressed in dislikes. Dislikes : Few problems with the film one being the main villain, which is a shame since Michael b Jordan playing this role is the best villain they have done by far, the problem here is that he doesn't get enough screen time as the film focus too much on the political and tribal side of the film.Which is ok which puts more focus on world issue and the conflict with T'Challa having to be a king while protecting the world around him, but as the main villain of the film there should've been more focus there as well because it seem that michael b Jordan character was only relevant in the 3rd act, he only become the golden jaguar for the last 30mins of the film.  This is what I mean by the film being unbalanced too much focused on the political side which drag the film down slightly.The other issue is some of the camera work it like the camera person can keep the camera still for 5 mins, there were a least 20mins of the film that was slight shaking, the some of the action scene again with this shaky camera. This show complete amateur filmmaking when a director has to rely on shaky camera effects for action screen, it the most hated thing in a film every, i urge film make to stop using it."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2021,6/10,"If I'm being honest, I was disappointed. Black Panther was such a standout character in Captain America: Civil War and with all the hype that was surrounding this movie, I was expecting to be blown away. But it just didn't live up to what it could've been and what the professional critics make it out to be. While it is watchable and has a decent amount of action in it, I found the script very predictable and the characters lacking depth. It's worth the watch, especially if you're a fan of the other MCU movies, but It doesn't hold a candle to the others in the franchise."
BLACK PANTHER,6 July 2021,2/10,"Needless to say this movie is highly overrated. This is one of the worst movies in the mcu, which is at the same level as fantastic four, dark phoenix and homecoming, ridiculously overrated by pretentious critics and fanboys. The story is so flimsy with bad and unconvincing acting, the costumes looks hilarious like a bunch of clowns in circus, cg is dodgy at the standard of tv dramas, even the compositing is bad where characters doesn't blend well in some scenes. It's a joke the critics are giving this a 8-10 which shows they are totally an unprofessional bunch of hypocrites, untruthful without credibility, scared of being accused of racism or politically incorrect. This is why IMDBs rating is just so unreliable and fake, shame on these moronic phony raters."
BLACK PANTHER,14 November 2021,9/10,Killmonger is one of the greatest villains there is. Great backstory which makes the characters actions very understandable.Michael B. Jordan gave the performance this character deserved.Incredible.
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,1/10,"First of all, I'm confused, who were the lead pairs? Because 99% of the cast delivered their dumbest acting ever! And the so called king & queen were most disappointing.
Second, the story! Phew! WTF was it - any of the scenes DO NOT lead to any conclusion at all. They are in Waganda, they go out to South Korea & they're back to Waganda. Instead of saving the world, the dumb people just fight with each other - to become king. 
Third - Who the hell is Black Panther? Any guy who can have the purple drink? What are his powers? Why is he called Panther, why not tiger or Cat or Girraffe? How come everyone in world is kind of Ok with BP?
Fourth - Why is everyone so dull? No energy except the negative characters and Okoye! Why aren't dialogues impactful instead of lengthy & boring?
Fifth - Why is technology overhyped? Making remarks like another broken white guy always showing that they're waaaaaayyy ahead from entire world. Why? It's neither used in Waganda nor outside. It's nowhere shown technology being used for their people.
Seventh - Connection? Where is it? Why are they crying talking about his dad but no conmexconn shown between them?Eigth - Why the fuck is this movie over hyped? How come 7.9/10. Thor was 8/10. ""Thor!"" No comparison!! Are you fucking kidding me? People are giving bad reviews but 6/10 & 7/10. Why? 
Marvel has first time dissapointed so badly! I never thought after Thor3 that it could ever happen."
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,7/10,"This film has beautiful production design and decent CGI and visuals and its stellar cast does an adequate job. Unfortunately the script is overwrought and some of the scenes play out forever although there are some decent action set pieces. Seemed somewhat overreaching to me, and played out like an average MCU superhero film. I think that politics played a role in the success of this film."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,6/10,"This is your typical superhero movie or worse because It was a little frustrating. The cinematography and the sci-fi part were okay, but other than that it was hackneyed scripts unluckily, the film fell short of expectation. Perhaps because of the hype, there were few good acting performances especially in the combat scenes but generally the movie didn't pull me in I find Michael B. Jordan character more fascinating than Chadwick Boseman however still average. The characters are not developing, and that's a snag. The filmmakers didn't evenly focus on all characters. After the first thirty minutes, the movie jumped the shark for me, and I was so bored.
It's too stale for a high budget film like this it had box office success but that shouldn't matter when the movie is not extraordinary and lacks originality.
The African accent was apparently fake; I didn't like the way they forced it to their mouth. It baffles me that this film is nominated for the oscar. Out of generosity I gave this movie six stars."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,7/10,"It's like the world is trying not to seem racist. Watching all movies up to date from the MCU i can witness that it has been difficult for the movies to gain an Academy award. Many have been nominated but none of them up until now have won any. Black Panther then suddenly took home 3 Academy awards and has grossed more money than any other MCU release. Also the metascore gave it an 88/100.It has it's moments of clarity and emotion but Black Panther as a whole is very average (in my opinion) referencing todays generation of meme's such as ""What are those?!"" It's like it's attempting to woo the audience with modern social references, it just comes across as cringy.This movie won an Oscar for best costume design, which i agree with as it's over view on african tribe traits was brilliant and the special effects were also on point (No Oscar for that though). Although it just didn't really have that spark.Deffinetely worth a watch just don't get all hyped up. Good special effects, good production, good acting but an average story."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2019,5/10,"With all its Oscar nominations I was expecting Black Panther to be something special. I was expecting too much. Because my expectations were not met I can only rate this a 5. If my expectations were lower I might have enjoyed it for what it is, a decent superhero movie, nothing more nothing less. The cultural significance is real though."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,,"Pay no mind to what the social justice warriors or the racists are saying about Black Panther online or in the media. It isn't some kind of trenchant commentary about ""white privilege"" or some kind of bitter screed against whitey. Rather, it's just a good film. If you see some kind of pro-black or anti-white message in Black Panther, then that's only because you want to see it. Recommended if you like this type of film."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,10/10,"Yes the spoiler show because many fans are a little bit disappointments , I love very entire main casts; Chadwick Boseman, Danae Guira, Winston Duke, Michael B jordan, Angela bassett, Lupita Nyong, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright in movie; great fascinating actions including director. I understand the main villain killed off film pissed fans of marvel. But sentimental for many people show T'challa more moral. Fans need see more connection with Erik which true. The problem is political in Africa show many royalty of throne have more power rule by monarch representing Republican. I really love movie end seems bittersweet and tear jerking. The movie inspire the Lion King but it show more political movements. Movie part killed main off pissed me a little bit. It show film overrated and hype. Movie show more appreciated culture originated Africa and racist crime of white. The main character T'challa I admire is very kind and ruthless with loving family.; he seems very forgiven, caring, benevolent and sympathetic;. Main villain; Klaws( Andy Serkis) and Killmonger ( Micheal B Jordan) are great; Killmonger show more tragic villain connection past of T'challa's family. Reviewer are anger of T'challa killed of Avenger Infinity War pissed many fans off because of worst villain Thanos; don't worry about- Captain Marvel save world. I never seen and read comics of movie adaption. Many fans are disappointing to see Man- Ape connection and Sebastian Stan's White Wolf and Killmonger connection resurrection more like Loki. OK honestly Black Panther are one first Originated African hero in Marvel portray overrated antihero; yet after year he can be a little but ruthless show more political situation. In comic, in day, he join many teams like Fantastic Four and Avenger and Illuminati to fight evil. Missing part; the not cloak yet show- cross your finger. Like Batman, both are stoic and multi billionaire and dark hero with cloak in comic with black suits. T'challa genuinely does care many people like family that he show helping other as well and on other hand; Batman show helped isolated but difficult issues get along well other JLA. Differently, in comic, Bruce real; family and show care other people; in 1930s."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2019,10/10,"Next sequel after movie win and steal ideas of Braveheart, In The Heat of The Night, Hamlet and LOTR. To be fair, make connection showing Stark and Captain America and Fantastic Four next sequel. Don't forget to add Thor and Shang Chi and Luke Cage and Blue Marvel. Ben- Hur could be inspire sequel a little bit but Ten Commandment probably be better. Don't forget Shari and Nakia and Erik Killmonger. Steal Best Picture demonstrates the 1970s apartheid modern style. Ordinary People and Out Of Africa could be influence next step of sequel."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2019,10/10,"Shuri get more more mature spin off seriously acting in sequel but reality need more danger view. Great movie, Erik killmonger upset fan who killed off. More casts need show serious adult not too much hype."
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2019,6/10,"This is one of those films they made solely to appease the diversity brigade, blacklivesmatter, feminista etc etc.This wasn't even what bothered me, it was the stupid accent by the main guy, and the tideous slow paced film progression.I was bored to tears 35 mins in and decided to call it quits. Not up to par with the other hero films.There were no white actors, the black actor tries to imitate the African accent, and the film was made in Hollywood, what the f is goin on"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"#blackpanther (2nd review) - Contains strong content based on the #blackhistory and the colonization together with struggles in world politics. This time, Marvel comes with a serious movie compared to their previous three movies such as Dr. Stranger (2016), Spider-Man Homecoming & Thor Ragnorak both were in 2017 to prepare the audience the audience mindset for getting ready to Avengers #infinitywar . Black Panther also will be the best film of Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man (2008) &Captain America The Winter Soldier (2014). My first review was just simple because it was after premiere so today is the official release around worldwide."
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2021,8/10,"This is a very captivating and well put together film. It has plenty of dramatic and emotional scenes, but it also has it's funnier moments, usually when Shuri is on screen. This movie also has great acting when it comes to the entire cast, but especially when it comes to Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman. By the way, those two as T'Challa and Killmonger might have the bets on-screen rivalry of any hero and villain in phase three. Overall, this was the perfect movie to be released before Infinity War and was a very good one.8.4/10."
BLACK PANTHER,25 November 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is the latest MCU movie. After he appeared in Civil War, there was much hype for Black Panther getting his own solo film. After seeing it I think this is the best MCU movie since Civil War. Is it the best MCU movie? No. I feel like every time one of these comes out now everyone praises it as the best in the MCU. Critics said that about Thor Ragnarok when that came out. I liked that film, but really it was an okay film at best. Black Panther is definitely better than Ragnarok. I'd it's actually a genuinely good movie, but not without its faults.The general cliff notes plot is as follows. With his father dead, T'Challa/the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is now the king of his home country of Wakanda, the most advanced, and secluded, nation on Earth. However, our main villain Killmonger challenges the new king's reign and attempt to use Wakanda's advanced technology to dominate the world.First I'll delve into the positives. Firstly, I really like the Black Panther as a character. I was already impressed with him in Civil War, but I wanted to hold off judgement until he got his own movie. Now I can say Black Panther is my second favorite MCU character behind Captain America. The side characters were pretty decent too.The film has great cinematography as well. The majority of the film takes place in Africa/Wakanda and it looks fantastic. Not only that, but the film does a fairly good job delving into the culture of Wakanda and its inner workings, backstory, and political stances and issues.Most of the action was good and shot very well, with a couple exceptions, which I'll get into. I also like the style this film has, from its opening and closing aminations, to its score, to even way of using text and credits. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.Killmonger, in my opinion, is one of the better MCU villains, up there with Loki and Zemo. His goal is rather basic, but his motivations are understandable to where you can sympathize with him to a degree. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in the performance as well.The film is not perfect though, as I've stated. The movie has the same issues the Thor movies do. The scenes in Wakanda are great, but the scenes in our society, while not bad, don't measure up in comparison. While most of the action was good there were a couple underwhelming scenes. The opening action in particular was shot too dark and filmed with much shaky cam that it was hard to enjoy. The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was also too short and underwhelming.Lastly, the minor villain played by Andy Serkis I did not care for at all. Andy Serkis is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his best performances. I don't blame Serkis, but more the lines and direction he was given.Overall, Black Panther is a very solid entry in the MCU. Is it the best like so many say it is? No. Is it revolutionary, like many claims? No. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the MCU or just comic book or action movies in general."
BLACK PANTHER,17 June 2019,4/10,"Overhyped, overrated. That CGIs blew my eyes. Is this an animation movie? Every MCU movie is better than this. This movie was nominated for Best Picture... USA tries to efface official slavery with these movies. This movie is not good as Scary Movie.As I sad they trying to efface slavery but this movie named ""BLACK Panther"". And panthers are black. What a idiotic movie."
BLACK PANTHER,3 January 2019,9/10,"It's interesting to see all the mixed reviews of Black Panther. I'm in the I-love-it camp. But I understand how a lot of people could struggle to really love it as much as me.I'd say that Black Panther's best quality is that it's more of a science fiction type movie remarking on real compelling global issues than a regular safe good heroes saving the world from selfish villains narrative. You know. The type of story where the villain knows or doesn't care that the plan is evil because its their nature to be proudly selfish. The foundation of Black Panther also isn't irreverent jokes and dazzling cinematic battles for the sake of visual aesthetic wonder. Black Panther has some solid quips and visuals. But I'd argue it has more of the science fiction elements than the regular superhero elements. And many people probably expected and were disappointed not to to experience the opposite.For instance Black Panther being a superhero feels secondary to him being the king of Wakanda. I find this element of open leadership and responsibility great and appealingly more similar to the struggles of real heroes. But many people are going to prefer the other type of simple escape from reality story. I don't mind superhero movies of that type. I just find them inferior to a story like Black Panther's when done right.The film has a few moments where it might be a bit too smarmy and proud of its progressive side. It also has a few silly moments which seem to exist merely for the sake of fitting within the Marvel Universe than supporting the Black Panther story.But overall I find it to still be a great story and it feels like a Marvel movie one could appreciate even if one hasn't seen any of the other Marvel films. It has some great acting and character development. The cinematography, directing and pacing are great. As well as the score, costumes, and sets. The environment of Wakanda is very well developed as well.Overall I'd say it's the best Superhero movie I've seen. It's innovative, but works because it adheres to a lot of basic effective movie principles. It doesn't try to invent new ingredients for storytelling, but it puts ingredients we're familiar with together in different ways to create a very appealing and distinct final creation. I'd a well deserved 10/10 in my book."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2019,1/10,Its good but I felt it was so overrated. I prefer the Welsey Snipes black superhero movies. Much more authentic.
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,"I heard about Chadwick's passing of cancer since last night. He really had a good life when he filmed this movie. To me, Chadwick will always be a superhero in the MCU. I liked this film. It won't be the same without him for an upcoming sequel. We will miss him.RIP Chadwick Boseman
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"The latest film in the Marvel Universe has arrived with ""Black Panther"" and it continues the tradition of big budgeted event films from Marvel. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Bodeman), as he prepares to assume the throne of the country of Wakanda after the death of his father. He is destined to lead over a nation that to the outside world seems impoverished and rural, but is secretly a very technologically advanced society thanks to their Vibranium resources. The resources allow them to keep their capitol city hidden from the world.
As T'Challa attempts to assume the throne and rule over the various tribes of his country; a threat from his past both known and unknown arises. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) surfaces, T'Challa mounts and effort to bring him to justice which in turn sets a chain of events into motion. A mysterious and deadly figure known as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), plans to obtain the Vibranium to exact a plan of revenge so severe it will lead to the nations of the world being subjugated and will divide even the most loyal citizens of Wakanda.
T'Challa must use his powers as The Black Panther and guardian of Wakanda to save his people and the very world from a threat that holds the fate of the world in the balance.The film takes a while to get going as Director/Co-Writer Ryan Coogler takes his time introducing audiences to the world of Black Panther and especially the various characters. The strong supporting cast features Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Martin Freeman, and so many others that it is great to see such well-rounded characters.The film does take a while to get up to the action but when it arrives; it delivers making the wait worth it. What I really liked was that the characters were well-defined as were their motivations. You did not have some cartoon mega-villain with some insane scheme, but rather a realistic and believable threat whose motivations were understandable though misguided.
Marvel has again delivered a very thrilling story that fits well into their extended universe and you will want to make sure to stay through all the credits for the two additional scenes which sets up future events for the Marvel Universe. ""Black Panther"" is a rousing success all around continues Marvel's Cinematic Universe in grand style.4.5 stars out of 5"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,4/10,"Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of Marvel films. I haven't watched a film in this series since Guardians of the Galaxy, and my reactions to the few I've seen have generally ranged from indifference to hatred. If you consider yourself a fan, feel free to take my thoughts with a grain of salt or just ignore me completely.With that being said, the best I can say about Black Panther is I didn't actively dislike it as much as I have some other Marvel films. I mostly just found it incredibly lifeless and boring. There is a pervasive feeling of blandness and inertia that plagues this film from beginning to end. Nearly the first full hour feels like an exercise in directionless wheel-spinning. On paper, it makes some sense to spend the first chunk of the film world-building and introducing us to the new environment and characters before the plot kicks in, and I guess the film attempts that? Kind of? But sadly, sweeping, panoramic, CGI vistas of the city don't really count as ""world-building"" in my book. And almost every scene in Wakanda that isn't a CGI flyover takes place on a small greenscreen-shrouded soundstage. It all has a sterile, artificial, and clinical feel and the culture of the city simply doesn't translate into something tangible.The characters don't fare better. For all of the buzz about this being Marvel's ""character-driven"" film, what really surprised me the most was just how uninspired these characters were. The villain is the only one who rises slightly above the pack, but he's really only interesting in a relative sense given that every other character here is flat and generic. Andy Serkis as the side-kick villain was ok too I guess; he was one-note, sure, but at least he had a note. In a particularly eye-roll inducing scene, we see the ""elder"" Wakandan (Forest Whitaker's character) killed off by the villain in melodramatic fashion. Am I supposed to care? This ""character"" had literally no establishment, personality, or stake in the film whatsoever. He's the older dude with the long robe who's probably wise or something. He died now. Feel something.At least the film had a message though, right? It was about something more than a good guy fighting a bad guy! In the most superficial of senses, yes. But the fact that this film is being seen as some sort of political statement heralded for its cultural insight is ridiculous. The ""substance"" of this film is essentially a sprinkling of heavy-handed dialogue which references topical issues like immigration and identity politics. It amounts to an illusion of depth to distract you from what is, at its core, another standard and vapid comic book film.Strong 2/5"
BLACK PANTHER,26 June 2018,2/10,"Wow, what am I missing - who rates this movie so high? its boring, the acting and dialogue are pathetic and the CGI at times is dodgy to say the least. Another piece of crap off the never ending conveyer belt of superhero movies that yet again has been rushed out to cash in on the popularity of this type of rubbish."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,2/10,"Film is 2h 15m and nothing really happens. How this have almost same score as civil war or ragnarok is beyond me. shame, this panther deserve better."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"Dear readers, Black Panther is here to remove all your prejudices about Africa and racism that counters the Africans, eventhough the word ""black"" here is not representing African continent, but the power of hero, like a Panther, whose the color is black. So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline ""Wakanda forever"" becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward. We hope that there will be Black Panther 2!! :)"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"That I am ashamed to admit that I have literally fall asleep...no idea how much I missed from the action but it didn't matter...at least I was more rested than when I entered in the cinema. I could sleep at home, though, and save the money paid for the ticket..."
BLACK PANTHER,7 October 2021,8/10,"Black Panther is a thrilling, long-awaited adventure. The emotional makeup of the film is well executed, aided by solid acting and meaningful dialogue between the main characters. The visual effects, and especially the costume design, are eye catching, being of key importance to the film's narrative. The comedic aspects work on and off, but the serious nature that beholds the film works to its excellence enough to overshadow any faults. Overall, the plot line was well scripted and intriguing."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,1/10,"The entire concept of 'Black Panther' with a third world country that is supposedly technologically advanced is, ofcourse, utterly ridiculous. This means this movie was probably doomed to fail from the start, yet the mess it has turned out to be is just an affront to cinema in general. There are a lot of problems with this big pile of garbage, and naming all of them isn't really possible in a single review, so let us pick out the most obvious ones. The general core in a film is its story and storytelling abilities, combined with compelling characters and character development. All of these things Black Panther has failed terribly at. It is a terrible and nonsensical plot about this country in Africa being a technologically advanced nation, yet they still fight for the crown of king like a bunch of barbarians? A plot can transcend realism factors with its story, but it cannot transcend ridiculousness, which is what this movie has done. This in turn makes it empty, with no characters to care about and no story to care about, because it is such an absolutely ridiculous bunch of nonsense it isn't possible to relate to. As if it couldn't be any worse the plot is incredibly predictable. A certain person appears to die but you know he didn't. A certain person is a mysterious outsider but you know who he is already. The villain can also kill the hero but prefers first to speak a few words so someone can save him.Unfortunately even though the movie itself is terrible, it is also covered in a SJW political kind of cover. There are a lot of messages that one needs to help the entire world, and all of the women guards ( What a joke ) fighting like they have some kind of superpowers is just tiresome feministic ridiculousness once again. It is just laughable that the supposed greatest 'warrior' and general of wakanda is a woman, it makes you think about what kind of wimps the men are like there. Nonsensical feministic message once again. If the art form that is film has turned into this kind of social propaganda, there is little feature left. Bunch of nonsense to keep the feminists and social justice warriors happy is all the message is here, no morals and no psychology.The actors unfortunately also leave much to be desired. Everybody has this weird african accent that makes it look like they can barely pull a bucket out of a well yet we are supposed to believe this nation is technologically superior, just a joke. This is excluding the villain ( Michael B. Jordan ) in the film who is even worse as he talks like some idiot straight out some hood in the Bronx and combines this with his weird head uptilts and gestures and 'Bro' dialogue that is as out of character as can be if we want to take this idiot seriously. The movie did start out with a decent villain in the form of Andy Serkis, but he was unfortunately replaced halfway through by this idiot. Not to mention the weird cringy facial expressions especially the woman warrior makes all the time.We once again have cheap CGI as an excuse for nice cinematography, but it just looks bloated and ugly and not at all authentic, as it will always be. Greenscreen cannot possibly replace the seduction of natural lighting in actual beautiful environments, and it is also the reason this movie just looks ugly. The fight scenes feature terrible choreography with superhuman jumping and weird moves which you might have seen a lot in a couple of terrible videogames. It also includes a scene in which the villain and hero fight in midair, reminiscent of the absolutely terrible fight between Neo and Smith in Matrix Revolutions, but this one is just as bad. You can tell all of the fighting and the moveset is just pure CGI, there are no impressive athletic skills, just videogame jumping around nonsense. There are also a couple of scenes near the end which are stolen straight out of Return of the King and Star Wars, as if this already mindless project ran out of further ideas.With terrible actors, terrible acting, terrible clich√© dialogue ( Especially by our forced delivery clich√© fest master Michael B. Jordan ), irrelevant political messages, ugly cinematography, ugly choreography & mediocre modern day music Black Panther isn't just bad, it is indeed, a disaster for whom i can name no good points."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2020,10/10,There are a lot of corporate interests that need be served here and yet Coogler has made a blockbuster that feels deeply personal and pertinent to the times we live in.
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,7/10,"In typical Marvel fashion, this latest movie adaptation of a comic book was as solid as the rest. The casting was good, the acting was good, the story was good, generally speaking this movie was for all intents and purposes, good. Shuri was certainly the most fun character, T'Challa inspires honor, dignity and humility with an ""always do right"" attitude, M'Baku was just cool, Romanda was stately as a true Queen ought be, and Kill-Monger was a tragic, but despicable villain who carried with him years of misplaced rage -- they were all well portrayed, and quite believable.And therein lies the problem: It doesn't stand out in any real way, nor does it inspire repeat watchings, or even the need for a sequel. It simply melts into the Marvel Cinematic Universe without making any real or significant impact. It was a fun movie, but despite the hype surrounding it, and despite the overblown political nature, it was, in a very strange way, bland.That arguably is the biggest problem that the Haus of Maus faces with all of it's major blockbusters now: They have gotten so good at the formula, that they aren't daring, nor are they even trying anymore. They cookie cutter the formula over and over again, change a few things here and there, and call it a new movie. We are essentially living in an age of Pop-Movies, where there is little difference between A and B, other than the physical appearance, and maybe a little bit of dialogue here and there.After a while though, I started to feel a bit bothered in that a great deal of this movie felt trope-y, in that it had an idea of Africa, without really actually being African. Kind of like how many of us imagined China-Town was after watching Big Trouble in Little China, this started to feel like it was more of an Idea of what Africa was all about, rather than what Africa is all about. Naturally of course that makes sense as Wakanda is an idealized destination, however parts of it felt more like a Disney ride, exploiting the imagery associated with what folks might typically associate with Africa.Again, it wasn't bad, but it didn't really leave me with much other than being offended at the constant white jokes and jabs, and the turning the children in the end into little more than a stereotype where they said ""we can take this apart and sell the pieces"", referring to T'Challa's hover-ship that landed in the middle of an Oakland California Basketball Court.However, I do understand why they made this movie, and the meta-narrative behind it is... a curious thing, if you understand the story."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"I'm at a loss for words that I can't even phrase them out carefully.While the story may somewhat fall short (it does share a few parallels to 'The Lion King' when observed carefully), it makes up for it with an interesting cast performance done by Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and Letitia Wright, the visual setting also feels so immersive you'd think you're actually there. Notably, Freeman's character Everett Ross began to slowly remind me of Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, but toned down in a different approach for humor. Not to mention the blend of traditional tribal music and an appealing soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar compliments both dramatic and intense scenes respectively.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'challa (Boseman) is chosen to succeed his late father by naming himself as King of Wakanda. Things drastically change when old wounds open from his father's past.After seeing Marvel's previous outing Thor: Ragnarok months back (which relied so much on a comedic approach), Black Panther is definitely a solo film that can hold its own with less humor and its blend of intricate action and drama. I mean based on the flashbacks and despite the intentions T'challa and Killmonger (Jordan) each had for the good of Wakanda, I couldn't help but pity their own respective causes. The former has his ideals and is about being virtuous by working hand-in-hand with their outside allies. Whereas the latter's intentions are morally unjust due to his own troubled past. It's completely understandable but for the wrong reasons.I will say that it's not entirely perfect, but it was more than enough to keep me enthralled at what Black Panther can do."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2020,8/10,"Black Panther got me interested in Marvel movies again. Before Black Panther, I'd been completely put off Marvel movies for the fact that they were cookie cutter type of movies. The villain is always going to lose, the hero will always win, even to the point of falling of the cliff and have the hero handing on by one hand, no sacrifices ever really have to be made, its full of cheesy one liners and doesn't really break from method. It was the same recipe, repeat over and over.Until Black Panther, this felt completely new. It felt like anyone could be killed, no one was safe. The music was fresh and complimented the whole movie. The cast was awesome, they felt actually badass, like I would be intimidated if I came across Black Panther, compare this with other superheroes who seem so weak or lame.The costumes and technology used was exciting and kept me interested throughout. The cast was funny and well chosen. Right from Chadwick Boseman throughout to all cast members there were great strengths in acting. Letitia Wright was very funny, alongside Michael B. Jordan who was perfect baddie. Strong, ruthless and motivated for the right reasons.This movie was epic and so enjoyable from beginning to end. If you're over Marvel and their predictabilty then give this a go."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,1/10,"I am against discrimination. But I honestly think this movie is overrated just because there is a black super hero! ( It's also a bit discriminating towards all others that there were only black actors but ok it's not the topic here)... 
I hardly could stop my husband to go to the movies because he said there are really good reviews. But after seeing it, I wanted to check IMDb. And I wish I checked it earlier... so many people have already written my thoughts. So many 1 stars... 
well, it's your choice of course so no spoilers from me..."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"As I reference in the title of this review this isn't your typical run-of-the-mill superhero movie, it truly is a kind of film that makes you think. Usually when I watch a movie I am able to give my thoughts on it pretty quickly but this one took me about a week after I watched the movie to be able to give an idea of what I thought about the film. The story and what takes place within the story which I think has great depth and emotion. I believe it was a genius move to introduce us to the character of Black Panther/T'Challa in the Captain America: Civil War as it allowed in the standalone movie to explore other realms and characters within the world of Wakanda. In Black Panther, the main character Black Panther isn't exactly the center of attention. All of the side characters are given layers and strength giving the film the greatest group of likable characters that I have seen in a film in a while. There isn't one weak or unnecessary character amongst them. The female characters in particular are very strong. Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther/T'Challa is outstanding displaying an African ascent (considering he's American) and carries the film and makes the character his own. The characters of Black Panther/T'Challa is conflicted with family mistakes of the past while tending to the problems at hand. Anytime he gets into his suit; which happens only a few times; makes me excited. The world of Wakanda is the most beautiful world I've seen in a movie since Pandora in Avatar. The film wonderfully explains the world and how it all works making the world feel like a character itself. Michael B. Jordan who is a frequent collaborator of Ryan Coogler portrays the greatest villain in the MCU since Loki. His story turns this superhero film into not just that but also a very tragic Shakespearian-like storyline. A villain that we understand is someone we are supposed to dislike, but you can't help but feel somewhat sorry for Kilmonger. His motivations are completely understandable in why he does what he does. The music in this film is very good as well. All the drums help convey the African world and culture of the people. However, for as much as I love this film I do recognize some errors like all films do. Some people may think this has a very familiar story arc to that of other films. Some of the CGI is very noticeable and is disappointing considering its 2018, not 2003. Some shots are good while others are obviously noticeable. There was one fight scene near the beginning that was hard to make out because of shaky cam. I hate shaky cam and I was worried that this was going to be like this for the remainder of the film, but luckily it didn't, still that one scene was heavily compromised by the shaky cam. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film with beautiful music, characters, performances, and story elements that most of anyone will have fun watching. That is one word I can use to describe this film FUN. If you haven't seen this film yet give a chance and you may end up liking it."
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2019,6/10,"A lot of parts dragged, the CGI was pretty bad at times, and the editing and fight choreography was surprisingly poor (I really expected more out of that after seeing director Ryan Coogler's excellent work on Creed), but I understand why people like this movie so much. Who am I to tell people not to enjoy it?"
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2019,1/10,"OMG what a horrible movie. Thank goodness it didn't win for best picture. The worst, yes, but not the best. Didn't know if it were sic fi, drama , adventure or what it was supposed to be. Nowadays most of these movies don't need actors, just RE actors. Enough of these Marvel movies and lets get back to movies like the good old days where the story makes sense and people can actually act and and directors direct. No special effects and all that green screen junk. Just cartoons with people. This movie was dumb, dumb, dumb and the acting worse!!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is like a checklist. A checklist that fulfills every aspect and almost goes above and beyond. The film is unapologetically African and it subtly deals with real political issues. I'd argue the film is almost on par with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and the Captain America trilogy.Ryan Coogler has proven himself as a capable director in his own right, with Creed and Fruitvale Station, and now he's three for three with Black Panther. Coogler puts the characters and the narrative(albeit kinda predictable) first before the action and spectacle. I'd like to mention though some of the cinematography is gorgeous so kudos to Rachel Morrison. Costume designs are fabulous so another kudos to Ruth E. Carter. Last but not least to the visual development team, Ryan Meinerding, Andy Park, Carla Ortiz, and the others. I don't know if any of you ever picked up the concept art-books of the MCU films, but these guys and girls put a lot of effort into coming up with the creative look of each film. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole explore some thought-provoking ideas such as isolationism, revolution, and the cultures of oppression. They tackle real world problems without being too preachy or over the top, but enough to get the point across in an effective manner. If you have the strongest and not to mention the most versatile metal on Earth, I would doubt you'd want to share that kind of info to the world, but then again you can also do so much to help others in need. With that being said, this is where Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is effective. The performance is kind of over the top, but it registers and you can sorta feel his rage and anger. He's definitely not the wasted villain that the MCU is notorious for. As I've mentioned before, the Phase 3 villains, while not perfect, are a step up to every other villain the MCU has given us aside from Loki, Red Skull, and Winter Soldier. Jordan's portrayal while again, slightly over the top, makes you see his point of view like The Vulture or Zemo. The women also are a stand out. Angela Bassett's role doesn't have too much to do but her acting chops alone make you believe in her relationship with T'Challa. Letitia Wright provides a lot humor as the sharp witted Wakandan genius and sister to T'Challa, Shuri. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira are also highlights as Nakia and General Okoye. Nyong'o and Boesman don't overplay their complicated/romantic relationship and Gurira's character butts heads with T'Challa frequently, but is also fiercely loyal to her king. Other cast members are solid. I certainly didn't expect Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Martin Freeman to have the roles that they did, so kudos to Coogler and Robert Cole for figuring out all those moving parts. Especially Kaluuya's role as W'Kabi. Winston Duke and Andy Serkis just chew up the scenery with their roles as well. Particularly Serkis, as it was nice seeing Ulysses Klaue make his return. Now on to Chadwick Boseman. He is so good in this role I forget the accent he speaks with in this film is just him acting. When I watched interviews with him I totally forgot he has the American accent. He's equally believable as a superhero, but as a man grieving for his father and questioning his ability to be a fitting king. Yes the film is by the numbers, kinda predictable, and by the books, yes some of the special effects don't look as polished to be quite honest, the action set pieces are competent but not mind-blowing, and the shaky camera was a bit of an annoyance. With that being said, being a comic-book geek I am pleased with the final result and I cannot wait to see what Marvel Studios has in store for T'Challa next. Black Panther has been quite the talk lately as there have been many opinions about the significance of a black superhero. Let us not forget about Wesley Snipes's Blade, but up until Black Panther's release, much of Hollywood considered a film with an all black cast as niche for certain demographics, but never as a blockbuster or a franchise like this. Like Wonder Woman, Black Panther will open even more doors for movies similar to them, and everyone associated with this movie on another level. 8.8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2021,9/10,"Black Panther is a worthy installment to MCU. The movie truly succeeds as a movie basing on the hero after being first introduced in Civil War thanks to very solid writing that has given a great story and a ton of entertaining and intense action. The characters are likable too. And it has features beautiful visuals and cinematography that brought Wakanda to life. I won't spoil anything, but the final battle has demonstrated its message against hatred. If you're a true Marvel fan that would like to see Black Panther part of MCU, definitely go check it out. I would honestly say this is one of the better movies from MCU. Rest In Peace, Chadwick."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Now, I'm just gonna lay it out there even though it's an unpopular review but I found the movie, uhm, just good. I have gone online and read multiple reviews about how it's one of the best of the 18 MCU movies to date and for me, it's not even in my Top 5. I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite ""damsel in distress"", Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B. Jordan who I'm thankful they rescued from the dreaded Fantastic Four reboot as one of the movie's antagonist. You know who I'm not raving about? Chadwick Boseman. He seemed okay in Civil War and I don't know if he had to stay stiff because he was royalty but he was boring as a brick. As in don-the-suit-already-and-scratch-my-eye kind of boring. I was actually thinking Chiwetel Ejiofor would've been a better choice but he's already come up as Mordo in Dr. Strange. Storyline was interesting and current, fight scenes were worth the wait, the ending could've been better but is good enough.So to recap, good movie, great visuals, impressive supporting cast, exhilarating fight scenes and we want a Shuri, Tony Stark face off.Favorite quote: We must find a way to look after each other, as if we were one single tribe."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,7/10,"First off I would like to say that I've deliberately put off writing this review. I was quite conflicted because of the overwhelmingly positive reactions that this movie managed to accumulate. I will preface this review with stating that it was a good movie but ... at the same time it felt like it was lacking certain storytelling aspects. But we'll get to that in a second.Based on the fact that it is one of the highest grossing movies of all time some people made the assumption that it is a ""monumental"" superhero movie that is akin to ""The Dark Knight"". I disagree with that statement. The movie was fun to watch but it wasn't as ""monumental"" as the Dark Knight movie. Furthermore I'd like to point out that a movie's box office performance isn't necessarily a good indicator for its storytelling aspects. I personally like to believe that the movie seemed a little bit boring at times (especially during the middle segment). It only got really interesting when the villain finally showed up, which took some time. But then again, this is an origin movie so you have to expect everything to take twice as long as usual due to the limitations of the genre. And once the user is fairly accustomed with the origin story things can progress at a much faster pace. All origin movies have to struggle with this odd pacing. Which is also the reason why I'm not very fond of origin movies in general (despite their importance to new viewers).The film score was amazing. Ludwig G√∂ransson did a really good job composing it. It was super authentic due to its many ethnic elements and added a great deal of depth to the overall ambiance of the movie. The cinematography was also quite breathtaking. With those awesome aerial shots of the African landscape and the interesting camera angles. Like e.g. that one scene where the camera swivels horizontally as Killmonger walks into the throne room. That one was a pretty cool shot that you don't really see that often. Actually, now that I think about it the movie had a lot to offer but I simply feel like the story itself wasn't quite on the same level. Let me explain:
Out of all the protagonists it really seemed like T'Challa was the least interesting one, which is pretty weird considering that it's a movie about him, the Black Panther. Killmonger and Okoye e.g. were far more compelling characters, just to put it into perspective. My biggest criticism however concerns a pretty obvious storytelling flaw; the lack of character development.
Okoye was probably the only character that grew/""changed her ways"" when push came to shove. The UN speech that T'Challa gave at the end made for the perfect ending but it also felt very forced to me. At no point did he even ""consider"" to metaphorically break bread with other nations. Not even when Nakia, his ex-girlfriend who he still has feelings for, suggested it. It just seemed odd for him to do a total 180 on a subject matter that he used to be so stoic about. So yeah, I would say it wasn't very believable.A minor thing that I would also like to mention is M'Baku's demeanor. In the comics he's far more antagonizing. After all he's one of Black Panther's arch enemies. He definitely seemed a little too friendly in the movie (if you know the comics). And yeah, in the comics he goes by another moniker: ""Man-Ape"". The director however decided to simply go with M'Baku instead because it might be racist? I personally don't agree with that decision. Man-Ape isn't a racist name for a villain. Especially once you realize that M'Baku and his tribe are literally worshiping the gorilla gods in the comics. It makes perfect sense.On a side note:
The Black Panther suit received a well-deserved design-upgrade and looks much better than the one from the comics. It's very aesthetically pleasing with all those streamlined metal spike adornments. I dare to say that it's arguably the best looking suit in the Marvel CMU to date (the only contender would be the ""Iron Spider Man""-suit but we have yet to see it on Peter Parker). At the end of the day the movie was more like an appetizer. That's at least what I took away from it. I'm convinced that the Black Panther and Wakanda will probably play a bigger role in the upcoming Marvel movies. 
I'm also pretty certain that the sequels will be much better. Mostly because they won't be origin movies.Final verdict: recommended"
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2018,3/10,"Seeing as how this movie beat box office records and rottentomatoes rates it at 97% I was eager to watch this movie.But after enduring this simple formulaic story I am wondering, am I taking crazy pills? True the CGI is amazing and the cast is all-black but the story... there is quite a bit missing. Maybe the movie critics got bribed by Marvel to boost the ratings but I can't see how this got such high ratings.The storyline reminds me of those children's books in which there is barely any character development. ""See the dog run, the dog barks. The End"" In this movie we have a bunch of one-dimensional characters and simple situations. ""Bad guy wants to destroy the world, stop bad guy. The End""I found myself checking my phone and dozed off several times. It just isn't that great. Better luck next time Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2019,3/10,"I may be in the minority of critics on this movie, but it was a terrible movie. As you can see from my other reviews on here, there are certain superhero movies I like. But this was not one of them.The main reason is its obvious counterrevolutionary message. The Killmonger wants to use the energy of Wakanda to spread revolution across the world, but T'Challa wants none of that so he literally allies with a white CIA movie to bring him down in what can be described as a bloody coup d'teat. The population of Wakanda are not important in this struggle among the ruling classes, and like in most coups, T'Challa gains power (after losing it to Killmonger in a pitched battle, leading him to come to power in a binding manner by their own traditions and not in a coup) in a bloody manner. You can cite the ""feminism"" of this movie or that it reflects on previous African history of kingdoms before European conquest. However, those women fighters are part of an elite royal class. Wakanda is not, in any way, shape or form a democracy. It is a monarchy protected by force and weird traditions (especially those that are hereditary). This film is filled with stereotypes of Black people including the poor ""helpless"" ones of Oakland, or the ""bad"" revolutionaries who actually want to do good.For all the movies that have come out in recent years like Selma, Marshall, Blackkklansman (perhaps) and Sorry to Bother You, this movie falls short. I understand why people were drawn to see it, since it is the only major movie with Black superheroes, but it really was a lot of hype for not much of a result.Of course like all other Marvel movies, thus ties into the broader Marvel Universe so white Hollywood producers can get more money. In this case it is worse than with other superhero movies due to this racial aspect.I will not and will never recommend people watch this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,9/10,"The MCU has produced more than a few perfect superhero movies, but none of them have done it with as much cultural significance as this one. I am not qualified to speak to the impact that seeing an African superhero headlining his own movie has had on black people all over the world, but it should not be doubted. That this movie managed that while still producing the traditional action, colour, humour and excitement of an MCU movie is a remarkable achievement. Ryan Coogler and Chadwick Boseman (rest in peace, king) have created a gem. Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"The classic Black Panther story returns, with the new edge in terms of tech and talent (no spoilers). The original storyline leaves substantial room for strong female characters -- and we have the amazing Angela Basset at the helm for this. The entire cast does a really amazing job and the special effects are exceptional. Points off for the execution of the multiple spirit world scenes, which could have been much less ""Lion King,"" especially given the amazing job done in the rest of the film. Despite this, the movie ranks highly for me as a great action-adventure film for the whole family."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,3/10,"Let me get the positives out of the way first. Visually the movie is good and the sound effects are also good.Now let's talk about the rest.The story is a complete mess and FULL of political ""ideas"" that are at minimum a little bit questionable. The actress that plays Michonne on TWD plays a character here that stays loyal to the nation of Wakanda and the throne. It doesn't matter who sits on it and what kind of questionable decisions that person makes. I think most dictators in human history would be proud of this kind of loyalty. Overall she just follows orders and never in history has that ever gone wrong. The only reason why she turns on Killmonger is that T'Chala (Black Panther) was still alive and the so called ""challenge"" wasn't over.How one is supposed to even remotely connect to that character is beyond me. If BP really would have been dead she would have been one of the ""bad guys"", because she is loyal to the current king.The sharing of technology was only ever discussed in terms of giving it black people to fight their ""oppressors"" while calling all the white people colonizers and oppressors, This movie promotes a race war and that makes me sick.In addition the movie premise doesn't make any sense to begin with. There was the asteroid that hit Africa over a million years ago and people in the area started using the vibranium and advanced on a technological level much faster than other civilizations. Yet they didn't try to unite the people of Africa and share their technology amongst all black people? Remember please that the earliest records of colonization relates to Egypt and Ancient Greece (around 500BC) and they pretty much were limited to the most northern Parts of Africa. The more aggressive colonization happened many centuries later once communication and weapons were improved. So overall based on the story the Wakandans had a lot of time to take over Africa and build an extremely superior culture compared to the rest of the world. Yet they let their ""brothers and sisters"" be enslaved and mistreated. What does that make them?I know this is just a movie. But people treat it as extremely important, because it's about ""black power"" ehm I mean empowerment. I have seen movies and TV shows back in the 90s that were more progressive than this.I originally wanted to stay away from the movie because it was so politically charged. But curiosity got the better of me and I watched it and I wish I hadn't seen it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,2/10,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply uninspiring. There was no chemistry among the characters, and little reason to care.The very average acting also didn't help."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"I was super excited for this movie. Considering it is the last movie before the Avengers: Infinity War movie, I had high expectations for it.The story was all over the place. There was little presence of character development. The movie jumped into each of the characters as if we had already seen them all before in prequels.Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, was back. He was briefly introduced to us in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Klaw was selling stolen vibranium to Ultron in the middle of the movie. It was established that he was the only survivor to ever break into Wakanda and steal their precious vibranium metal. Now the Black Panther movie started in 1992, where it showed the aftermath of someone who betrayed Wakanda by giving Klaw a way to get in to steal the vibranium. It was actually an extremely weak opening to the movie. Instead of showing Klaw breaking into Wakanda and stealing the vibranium, it only showed a 5-10 second video surveillance clip of the destruction. This opening scene set for a terrible movie. Marvel should have shown Klaw breaking into Wakanda to give us more development for his character.The movie did not get interesting until towards the middle where the sale was going to be made for stolen vibranium. General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira, was absolutely awesome! She was by far the best character in the movie. Her dedication to the Wakanda throne was unparalleled. Okoye went crazy, in a good entertaining way, during the sale of the vibranium. I swear, I think she was fighting and beating up more people in this movie than Black Panther was!Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, was disappointing. I am not referring to his performance. I am speaking of his character development. We were first introduced to him in Captain America: Civil War. We received a glimpse of him as Black Panther and Prince T'Challa. In this movie, it continued directly after the Captain America: Civil War movie timeline. It did not show T'Challa as a child. It did not show him learning how to become the Black Panther. It did not show any of that. Come on Marvel, what were you thinking?Black Panther's fighting scenes were annoying as well. The majority of his presence was at night. It made it difficult to see the detail of his ability and movement. There was really only one scene towards the end where his suit was not so blended in the dark, but it was quickly ended after the fight moved underground to the vibranium mining area.Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, was a great villain. But once again, there was minimal character development. It showed him as a child for a few seconds, then it fast forwarded to the present day. All of the in-between were quickly talked about and forgotten.Overall, I was not too pleased with this movie. Marvel could have done better with the opening scene and the character development. Now I am left questioning how good Avengers: Infinity War will be in May."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is easily one of the most talked about movies in recent memory. A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, and are great reads.In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,4/10,"Hard to really pick a rating for this Marvel entry. All the clamor about one of the best Marvel films fails to meet objective standards. But money talks, very loudly! BP had a production budget of $200M and a marketing budget of $150M. It's like spending a few million for a Formula One racing car but getting a midsize Toyota. Not to say it's a bad film, but it could be so much better on so many fronts. I can understand Oscar nominations for special effects, visual effects and makeup/costumes. All deserved. Maybe even cinematography.But consider several things: acting is very average, script is a bit on the weak side, directing is average. It's a very expensivemaybe abive average superhero flick. But money speaks and you can market a film. If you show it in every theatre and bring it to attention of Academy members, you win. For example, think about the success of McDonald's: mediocre food but outstanding marketing and presence. So everyone wants a below average burger. In today's world, sometimes we fail to think for ourselves.The cultural impact on black America is immense, but that doesn't mean it's outstanding. It's interesting as it creates a whole new world in Wakanda. Which is why some critics rate it highly. Much like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, it follows a spectacular imagination. And think of some films that did that and failed overall: The Last Airbender, has been the worst. But that's comparison with LOTR ends. The acting, script and directing in LOTR series was much better. I rate BP only a 4 but I could give it a 5, 6 or maybe a 6.5 at its highest. But given all the overly optimistic voting, I'm downgrading it.BP' cast led by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and Michael Jordan as Erik really wasn't strong except the female roles of Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira were stronger, despite average scripts. It's solid entertainment but not Marvel's best. By comparison of superhero films of the same period, compare Wonder Woman. It's superior in many ways except David Thewlis as Morgan/Ares or the supervillain. You gotta be kidding, right? Somewhat not convincing. Patty Jenkins did a better job at directing than Ryan Coogler. But who's paying attention?"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,6/10,"Maybe it's because I went into this movie with low expectations, but I definitely did not hate this movie. The acting was reasonable for what they were trying to accomplish, the villain had more nuance than many other marvel bad guys (although I felt this was at least partially because it's 'wrong' today to create a black character that's irredeemably bad, but considering I want all villains to be treated like this I can't complain about the double standards too much). I had a few questions about how having a better metal makes them basically a futuristic sci fi society (stronger metal doesn't automatically equal flying cars, that's not how science works), but it made for a visually spectacular film. It suffers from the same syndrome as Asgard where for some reason their army forgoes ranged weapons in order to use amped up swords (despite being futuristic) oh well. All in all, not a terrible film, not amazing, but not bad"

BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2019,6/10,"A decent Marvel superhero movie but way overrated. About as good as the average Marvel flick, but not as good as some."
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,5/10,"The storyline here at imdb is just namesake, because there isn't really a story.There is tonnes and tonnes of cool tech, atleast 10 times as much as iron man movies, but it felt a little boring(I was surprised myself). At the same time the first iron man, the simple one he built inside the cave, was absolutely glorious.There is no heart in this movie, filled with people who had no depth. Both iron man and captain america fills you with strength and admiration, while the black panther and his entire group was pretentious and preachy.Do see it, its not irritating, but go in without expectation.In the last 30 secs (after credits), they showed something that made me happy. You can look forward to that."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2019,10/10,"I already know the hate this review will get. But it's true, this film transcends the marvel films into territory they haven't been able to even brush upon with their other films. From performances to script, to cinematography, this film has it all. I'm very concerned at the reviews on here where people are literally complaining about CGI. The landscape culture and the vibrant way it was shot was amazing. The CGI is solid, I don't get why people use it to bash films. If I were to watch a 1970s or older film I'm not going to bash it because the effects. I will judge the film off the film alone, how was the plot? How was the characters and acting? How was the cinematography? How was the script??? Like don't get me wrong. if it has impressive effects I will give them that and acknowledge it, especially for it's time, but I don't understand these people that complain about CGI and expect everything to be real. Let alone they expect every film to be some James Cameron focused CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love me some epic CGI especially when it pulls off so well, but I'm not going to judge the film so harshly on that alone and it's not fair that people do that. You should only do it if it's honestly distracting you from the plot or vibe in a moment of the film I guess, but even then I guess you can hate all the old films that came out back then because effects weren't the best JUST SAYING. Tired of these CGI fest people. ANYWAYS, this film delivers AND THEN SOME. It deserved to win best picture I have no idea why green room won over it but it did. This film achieved so much that it's a shame some audiences wouldn't know a good film if it was slapping them on the face. The performances from each character feels so rich and vibrant and everyone learns and changes to the end of the film. The VILLAIN is kick ass and by far the best villain in the MCU (over thanos as well) Michael B Jordan bounced back VERY hard after his failure in fan4stic. This film has the traditional superhero story but adds so much more with its own unique take. The director has such good talent using the amazing script. My only minor issue is the plot feels like 2 different films just minorly though. The Andy Serkis villain was great but his character kind of drifts away because something happens to him but then it shifts to a different film somewhat. It was a twist in a way but felt a bit fast and plot changing. Either way the characters still developed and didn't feel forced. The film is so beautifully shot from wakanda to the culture to the beautiful message of helping everyone around the world. The soundtrack is amazing and the music is SUCH heart wrenching and really captures you into the moment. There is some forced politics thrown in there here and there but it makes sense because it's an African country that has the utilities to help Africans when they were in slavery. Why wouldn't messages come up? I wouldn't say they were forced though it didn't feel forced for me. Captain Marvel forced their politics down our throats. From the feminist power, to ""illegal alien"" skrulls running from Donald trump... UGHH. But that's another story. I think black panther has it all AND more and for me personally it's definetly my top 10 favorite superhero movies of all time and definetly my #1 marvel film ever. Logan might be ahead MIGHT. But idk this film just has so much going for it.Plot 10/10

Special Effects 10/10Overall, Black Panther deserves the praise, the Oscars and It most certainly deserved to win best picture. Christopher Nolan, The Genius in filmmaking even acknowledged that it should have won. History is history. At least the academy acknowledged it. Either way this film was by far the best film of 2018 and it was nice to revisit the film once again to see if I wasn't crazy. When I'm sure I wasn't. It's a beautiful achievement in modern cinema. Not even superhero movies in general but in movies as a whole. It's definetly a film that stands out much more than meets the eye. I'm more of a DC guy but I can't deny marvel knows what they're doing. Good Job. Give the film a watch if you haven't. And if you have and don't agree then watch it again and take into consideration and try to focus on how it's such a huge achievement. And if you have seen it and agree with me, just watch it again because it deserves to be watched plenty of more times for it's beauty."
BLACK PANTHER,4 January 2021,,"You don't have to be a genius to figure out where the 1/10 ratings are coming from, calling this movie garbage! ""They"" are doing the same thing to Jingle Jangle, it's that same old evil that will never go away! But yet, ""they"" will rate some crap like Cobra Kai a 10/10! Black Panther won 3 Oscars, and received another 110 wins and 268 nominations! ""They"" try to destroy everything we do that's successful. R.I.P Chadwick, you were simply one of the best! We're missing you already brother...."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,7/10,"First the good:
1. It was very entertaining. Action, Fantasy and even comedy. The joke about the silent shoes, 'sneakers' get it. It cracked me up. There is a reason I mentioned it but that is for the bad.
A second joke I have to mention is: T'challa or Black panther ""froze like an antelope in the headlights"" when he went to fight his ex-girlfriend whom he still has feelings for. How true that is antelopes freezing in the headlights. Move you silly antelope out of the way scram. It gets annoying even.
2. A glimpse at the African culture but without mocking or glorifying it. It is almost neutral. Celebrations and jubilation everywhere. The accents was a nice touch though it has its pros and cons. Pro it is realistic, I mean you do not expect a Nigerian who lived in Nigeria to speak in an american accent even if it is a Hollywood movie.
3. The CGI was good unlike what other people tell you.
4. Rhinos in decorated armors. CGI I'm guessing.The bad: 
1.The goof about the shoes for silent shoes they surely made noise for later in the film, T'challa runs up a ramp wearing the sneakers and you could hear his footsteps.
2. The con to accents is stereotypes.
3. The conversation about using the Wakandan technology to help other nations was an idea shoved aside with some silly counterpoints about the tech going to the wrong hands. Yet they use the tech to save a 'white boy'. He is British. You are not fooling anybody Martin Freeman you are not American. Bragging about saving somebody is fine until you bring race into it. Even if it is a black person saying I'm going to save the 'white by'. The only reason we have the Everett K. Ross character is so that people cannot accuse a movie for 'black-washing'. Neither 'white-washing' or 'black-washing' is fair but neither is diversity hire because it does not seem to be about talent but the color of the skin. Things that fall somewhere in the middle:
1. However regarding the Wakandan tech they decide to reveal it which you would have found out had you stayed for the credits. Leaving a Marvel movie without watching the credits who is going to make that mistake again. ""What can a nation of farmers offer the rest of the world?"" some UN official asks condescendingly and the Wakandan's smirk. It is kind of silly but funny as well. 
2. Also in the credits there is a hint of Infinity War Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier appears. It would have been better if Black Panther was a stand-alone film but maybe less people would have watched it then. Who knows.
3. The Marvel franchise pitfalls plague this movie as well with its very typical story lines and I do not know what to think of it. Lately though some movies are breaking out of that (Thor Agnarok )so there is still hope yet."
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2019,2/10,"This movie is really bad not because it's the worst movie ever no not even close it's just people say it's the best movie ever and it's not at all it's not even the best movie with black panther in it.
Stop the overhyping."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,6/10,"This film is not helped by the impending Avengers: Infinity War. It is certainly not helped by running that trailer before the film and instantly removing any jeopardy by showing us which major characters live to appear again in the future movie!More importantly though, how do Michael Bay style fight scenes still exist in a world where John Wick choreography is available and Marvel money is on the table? Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing. Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere. But if I have to associate with a murderous villain who kills his own friends for no reason that isn't endearing me to the film."

BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is just a movie discussing some racist problems with lots of forgettable moments! For 01:30:00 I was going to give it a 4 out of 10, but then the movie went very good.Its biggest sins is the racial and racist cases that it shares. It's a superhero movie, not a drama or documentary movie! What were the writers thinking about while writing that movie?The characters ain't memorable, except for Chadwick Boseman, he actually improved as T'Challa / Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan was great as Erik Killmonger ,Martin Freeman was amazing as Everett K. Ross and Andy Serkis was good as Ulysses Klaue too.For more than half of the movie I was like ""Why this movie is very bad?"" then it went very good and surprising after the death -not death- of BP, after that everything went back on the course!Black Panther is getting a 7/10."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,4/10,"I tagged along with my brother to see Black Panther, and despite Marvel movies generally not being my cup of tea (I find them unimaginative, repetitive and full of cliches), my brother and I had high hopes and expectations of Black Panther. The reason for this is that everybody I knew that had seen it praised it for being one of the best movies they've seen in years and one of the best Marvel movies. I have no idea what those people were watching, but it certainly wasn't the same one I watched. Black Panther is a sub-par Marvel movie that has only gained such recognition and praise due to the revolutionary predominantly black cast. Putting the cast aside, the movie itself is completely underwhelming. The plot is coma inducing because it's SO boring and there is not nearly enough substance to keep viewers interested for 2 hours. Furthermore, the pacing and development of the plot is here there and everywhere. There seemed to be a complete lack of structure or build-up, and after 40 minutes my brother turned to me and whispered, ""What do you think? I'm really bored,"" which, in my opinion, sums the movie up in one - it's BORING.All of the characters are one dimensional (a common problem in most Marvel movies) and completely lacking in any personality. The antagonist is your typical vengeful young man hung up on getting revenge by any means necessary, but that suddenly turns into a solemn, soft and pitiful soul at the end. In contrast, the protagonist is your typical hero-type that does nothing to warrant being so important or special apart from being born into the right family. The supporting cast are equally one dimensional and many of them serve no purpose other than to flap over the protagonist. The CGI was pretty poor with the Wakanda backdrops being obviously green screen. I opted to see the 3D version and felt I'd wasted my money, since the special effects were lacking and the 3D only seemed to serve for decreasing the quality of the picture. Everything about Black Panther is utterly predictable and lacking in originality. The only thing that sets this movie apart from the other Marvel movies is it's focus on black characters and creation of the fictional nation of Wakanda, and the African culture that goes along with that. Putting that aside, every other Marvel movie I've seen has been better in every way. If you do opt to see this movie my advice would be don't get your hopes up. Whilst it's certainly not the worst movie in the world, it's also not what the critics praise it as being. If you are a huge Marvel fan, you may find more enjoyment, but in my honest opinion, it is just as unoriginal and boring as the rest of the Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2018,7/10,"And despite Michael B. Jordan's fantastic performance, which brought to mind Yul Brenner's turn as Ramses II in 'The Ten Commandments,' in terms of on-screen presence and charisma, I'm going to go against the tide and say that Eric Killmonger was not a great villain... and moreover, what was lacking in the characterization of Killmonger is what kept Black Panther from being a great film. But I'll start with the positive:There was a lot to like about Black Panther. It's a splendid sci-fi/fantasy vision of Africa. The world and its people (their costumes, makeup) where wonderfully realized. I also enjoyed the performances, basically across the board. Everyone was great in it. The film was pretty well shot and directed too, with the exception of a few key sequences (that I'll point out further down). Overall, Black Panther is a great looking movie, with terrific sound and atmosphere.Now the bad. I was really intrigued by the philosophical divide separating Killmonger and Black Panther hinted at by the movie. The idea that the nation of Wakanda should be an active participant in improving the lot of Africa and the African Diaspora is, in and of itself, a noble cause that has been debated amongst black leaders throughout history... as has whether doing it by working with the 'western world,' white men, or by bringing them down. It's been bone of contention between the likes of MLK and Malcolm X and many others.But where black 'radical' leaders looked to organize a resistance by rallying their people behind ideas, and empowerment first, violence afterwards, Killmonger by comparison had no philosophy, moral, or guiding principal. The moment he took power he revealed himself to be nothing but a common thug with a personal vendetta which, in my opinion, did a disservice to the supposed conflict at the heart of the film.The moral of the story could've been so much more than, 'don't leave the son of someone you kill alive, because they're going to come back to get you.' It could've been something much deeper and thought provoking.Asides from my issues with the writing as it pertained to Killmonger, my only other issue with the movie was the third act final fight sequence between Black Panther and Killmonger. It was darkly shot and frenetic. It wasn't just that it was hard to follow, it was also a downright unattractive final fight unworthy of such an otherwise good looking movie.But on the whole, I liked Black Panther. It was pretty well crafted and the novelty of the world, its cast, made for a fresh cinematic experience."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,3/10,"Th critics are either liars our were paid to say this was the best Marvel Movie, tis film comes NOWHERE CLOSE to films like the original Iron Man, Deadpool, or Logan. This was definitely an attempt the fashionable diversity quotas in Hollywood nowadays. Other than the ooh aah special effects, this film offered little substance than what was already on the surface. I get it, powerful African Americans and females are popular right now but this film just shoves it in your face, I was really turned off by it. I considered leaving the film about halfway through but figured I payed for it, might as well finish it.As I said the spectacles were are as to be expected with the wild high budgets of Marvel films. With that it had some unique special effects and wild rides that I suppose are worth the price of admission. But th story is just atrocious, poorly written and really did not suck me in. During scenes of dialogue I rolled my eyes and just waited for the next sequence of special effects. And again, I've got no problem with films about minority culture, I find them very interesting, but this was just in your face propaganda, it was just so terrible, I was truly turned off this film.I would say skip this trash."
BLACK PANTHER,21 November 2018,7/10,"It is a very good movie with some brilliant performances, especially, Michael B Jordan/Killmonger & Andy Serkis. Without them, it would've been another mediocre superhero movie. Thor Ragnorok is by far the better film"
BLACK PANTHER,30 July 2020,7/10,Marvel's Black Panther introduces us to a new place on earth which is a vast world within it's own. At the beginning you feel like the movie has a lot to offer but at the end it makes you feel it could have been better. The screenplay looks little bit sloppy at some places. Overall it's a film you can definitely watch at least one time.
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2019,8/10,"This movie is like a clear stream of the Marvel universe. It's not funny, nor selling corruption. The plot goes towards the classic to timeless Shakespeare's plays, and Black Panther shows the characteristics of ordinary people."
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2019,5/10,"I was looking forward to Black Panther and while I'm kinda glad I saw it, I recognize that it actually has a lot of problems. The acting is pretty hit or miss with most of the cast. T'Challa's sister is really funny and when they're both on screen, it's really nice. Michael B. Jordan is also pretty good as Killmonger. But Chadwick Bosman isn't as good as he was in Civil War. He feels very dull in this movie along with most of the tone. It's supposed to be laid back, but because of that, it's actually kinda boring. The CGI is really bad, especially during a fight at the end, but the practical effects are good. Story is alright for the most part, albeit pretty light. I'd say the highlight of this movie was seeing Bilbo Baggins again."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,5/10,"A pretty terrible marvel movie, up there with Hulk with Iron Man 2 in levels of a generic, poorly scripted, formulaic, but the one great thing about this movie was Chadwicks performance as Black Panther, he was brilliant in this and the other marvel movies he appeared in. RIP Chadwick, you were a great actor."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,1/10,"Embarrassing set, poorly written script, fake language accent, and off the cuff racist and anti-American trash dialogue.Garbage. There is not much else to say.Marvel has turned into a junk brand.How disappointing.We couldn't even finish the movie it was so embarrassing."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"Another MARVEL hero is here and this time it's not quite the usual stuff. Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight. The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch. Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role. Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm. A new wave is coming to the Hollywood and Black Panther might have laid a very strong foundation to it."
BLACK PANTHER,8 December 2018,7/10,"I enjoyed it more second-time round but it is overhyped. It is a good MCU film but nowhere near the best. There are two main problems with it:1. Although the villain is strong and has a good motive for his actions, this film falls into the classic Marvel plot of 'villain is in a similar suit to the hero; villain's suit looks more advanced; hero is knocked down; then eventually wins' - it's a bit old and generally Marvel are thankfully moving away from this rather dull story device but it's well and truly alive in this film.2. The women absoltuely steal the show! This is almost a good thing - how wonderful to see both black people and women portrayed as strong and smart and I don't think there was even an inkling of women just being there to be pretty or love interests. This is one of the best films I've ever seen with regards to female equality and portrayal. However, the movie's titular (male) character is almost irrelevant. Not to slate Chadwick Boseman's performance, he did a fine job, but the story would not really miss him. The women seem far stronger and more capable and don't particularly need him for anything. He has his own story but this film is about Shuri and Okoye and either one would probably make a better and more interesting hero.Nevertheless, this is worth seeing just don't believe the hype. It's a bit more Bond than MCU for the most part which is an interesting take so if you're looking for a mystical 007 adventure in Africa, Korea and London then you'll enjoy it."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2019,8/10,"I want to start this by saying that ""Black Panther"" is a very important film in terms of representation. This is also one of the only movies I have ever seen that introduces the audience to a new culture that feels like I could actually described afterwards. The soundtrack is amazing and really helps the transitions feel smooth and adds to the action sequences.However this movie has a pacing issue that results in it feeling like two films that were pushed together. The second half of this movie is definitely better than the first for the simple reason that Michael B. Jordan gets to shine as killmonger, one of the best villains that the series has had so far. The casting in this movie is brilliant with the interactions between Boseman and Jordan towards the end being what is most memorable about the experience. The pacing issues cannot be overlooked however and the fight scenes were a little disappointing given Coogler's previous work on ""Creed"" A very enjoyable film overall and a welcome addition to the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2019,8/10,"Marvel's little awards season darling.Black Panther is somehow one of the most important and talked about films of the decade and in all honesty it sort of deserves it. Coogler does what other MCU filmmakers would never do and dives head first into real world political issue, ending his film with a poignant note about free trade and open borders. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger adds a nuance that is missing in most comic book movies. Overall Black Panther is a breath of fresh air in an over-saturated genre.P.S that soundtrack is awesome!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 December 2019,5/10,This is garbage I was so bored that I wanted to leave the theatre
BLACK PANTHER,3 November 2019,9/10,Black Panther is another great film out of the MCU. the cast is great and this film has one of the best villains in the MCU. it has a good plot and the action is really good and fun until the end. Some of the the visuals are good. The CGI takes a dip in quality in the final battle and the villain becomes a evil version of the hero. But the villain's send of was nice although they probably could have kept him on for more films. Overall another fun movie.8.6/10
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2020,8/10,"A person's growth process, a science fiction masterpiece, has many places for thought."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2019,10/10,There's nothing wrong with expanding your product line if you do it correctly. Disney's Star Wars line have a few hits. However Disney's Marvel line were mostly hits. Black Panther is no exception. A meteorite with minerals of mystical properties impacts the African nation of Wakanda and empowers them with super human intelligence which they use to create a advanced tier civilization able to shield it's presence from the world. The kingdom is enlisted to defend the planet against hostel alien invaders.Excellent special effects merges with excellent action and writing...
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"First thing is first, this review is mainly about the supposed ""racism"" in the movie. Though I will talk about the movie itself too. Also to note I don't know anything about the comics so I don't know how accurate it was. If you want to skip my ""Racism"" section look for the ******** line and read below that.With this said lets get ""This movie is racist!"" out of the way. I am a white male near 40. I loved the trailers but once reviews came in I started seeing people talking about how its about ""Blacks being superior then whites and looking down at them like they are evil!"". And at first I did wonder if that was the case, but then I realized no Marvel movie would be that way because it would damage the fanbase. What reviewers FAIL to tell you is Wakanda has a few tribes that have varying views. Some want to help the world, some want to stay isolated and the last group wants to helps blacks to essentially kill off whites (and any race really) so they (blacks) can rule over the world. So yes, there is a group that is racist. But again, they are bad guys. The others are not like that. As that is how good vs bad works. Bad guys have bad views. There are some jokes like when they call the one white guy ""Colonizer"" and what not. But not sure how that can be taken as offensive given the fact the guy is british (not that we americans are any better) and did alot of bad things with blacks in the past. But in the end (spoiler) Black Panther (the king) decides the world is suffering to much and they need to open Wakanda up so their tech can be shared around the world. It would solve so many issues worldwide. Even in the mid-credits scene he speaks before the U.N. about we are all one (humans) and everyone should share in the good of what Wakanda has to offer. Which is the opposite of racism! *************Review itself***************
Overall the movie did seem a bit different then most Marvel movies given you mostly are in Wakanda. The CGI wasn't to bad. Though the city felt a little weird even though its explained as being advanced tech from a vibranium meteor crash long ago. Some of the tech that is used seems REALLY crazy advanced to the point of it almost doesn't make sense for being earth since until this time we haven't seen such advanced things. One thing that bugged me that they never really explained when someone drinks the vibranium leaf juice thing, why do they essentially wake up in a weird heaven realm and see their ancestors? Who then give them power? If its an alien world/species substance, does this mean it was from a world of blacks humans/aliens? Or does it just take black form in the heavenly place so they aren't afraid of it? Or do they actually see their ancestors? Its confusing. More so since Marvel doesn't really have a ""god"" in their universe per say. They have entities that are god like of course. Best not to overthink it I guess. Overall I loved the movie and look forward to more!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,8/10,"Black Panther (2018)This is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. T'Challa (Black Panther), returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a new adversary, in a conflict with global consequences. It is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. Critics considered it one of the best movies set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance. It received praise for its screenplay, direction, performances, action, costume design, production merits, and soundtrack. Notwithstanding, the CGI effects received some criticism. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, earning it the highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the third-highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Audiences gave the film an A+, the second superhero film to receive that grade after Marvel's own The Avengers. I found it a solid stand alone film, but it delivers a limited connection to the MCU other than the death T'Challa's father, albeit the plot engine for the film. Definitely one of the better movies of the series, but not sure if it's my personal favorite."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"My first entry in 2018, yeayyy.....!!! So here it goes....
When I watched it on the theater, I felt something not right about this movie. It almost didn't felt like, ""Marvelish"", in fact, it almost didn't felt like any mainstream superhero movie I've encountered over the past two decades since I was born for it tells more about the people and the reality some of us face around the globe than the hero himself. The effect of colonialism, racism, slavery, hatred, and the supremacist movement was put inside the heart of one man who is most likely to be the hero than the main character himself (whose alter ego becomes the very titular of the movie) had 'Black Panther' written as a literary source from the 18th - 19th century where slavery was at its peak: Erik Kilmonger.So yeah, what I'm trying to say is: 'Black Panther' would turn out gloriously as a masterpiece had it been written as a book comparable to 'Sula', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Things Fall Apart', or any other works that focus on the mistreatments of the Blacks/Afro-Americans. But as a movie? Errrr... not so much. I mean it's generally good and I see why so many critics fall in love with it, but some elements ruin the elements and the messages that made 'Black Panther' more than a comicbook movie such as the cgi based one-on-one fight between T'Challa and Erik (in fact, many of the phenomenal Black Panther's moves and martial arts were done by computers). I'm fully aware of the reason why they had to cgi-ed BP's over-the-top jumps, upper cuts, punches, kicks, overhead kicks, and so on, but at least try to involve more humanly approach (like wires, stuntmen, etc) and a more smooth cgi for these scenes to make it more realistic and pleasing to the eye. Why didn't they just copy the treatment of 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) for the fight scenes in this movie? Can't you see that the fight and chase scene between Bucky, BP, and Captain America was among the most jaw-dropping action scenes Marvel Studios has ever produced without so much waste of cgi? Honestly, I prefer the Batman raid scene in 'BvS' (considered by many as a ****** movie) than the duel match between BP and Erik in a movie that many people love so much. Not to mention that some of the scenes make the movie a little bit boring that some of us inside the theater either checked their phones and probably asking themselves when the movie might end.
Despite all of the downsides, this is probably the only movie that makes me interested in the richness African cultures with all the traditions, the dances, the songs, the warcry, the outfits, the earings, the histories, the tools, the masks, their way of life, their faiths, etc. Like it or not, we have no other choice than to admit that 'Black Panther' is one of the boldest movie Hollywood ever produce for it explore the black continent as it has never been done before by any other American movies before (though fictional one). It helps us to open our eyes of the beauty of the real-world Africa in the time where most of us are more fascinated by the work ethics and the cultures of the Japanese, the beauty of the South Korean boy/girl band members and actors/actresses, the economic prowess and the development of China, or the beautiful views of European famous big cities. The director (Ryan Coogler) has put so much effort in reminding us that this is a black people's movie, directed by black director, played by (mostly) black actors and actresses, about black superhero and the continent where he lives. You can easily find the director's intention from the African, 'Lion King-ish' backsongs on some of the scenes and the Afro-American rap style like the ones you can find in 'Fruitvale Station' or any other movies about black people. Ryan also didn't forget to put some Game-of-Thrones level of intrigue where the rightful king has to give up his rightful title and rightful throne to a stranger (who's actually the king's *SPOILER ALERT*) and the king's bodyguards (The Dora Milaje) have no option but to obey and protect their new king despite their resentment to him.Oh wait, have told you about another BP's villain, Ulysses Klaue? Played by the great and magnificent Andy Serkis, Klaue is, in my most humble opinion, a more suitable choice for the role of an antagonist than the tragic hero Erik Kilmonger thanks to these factors: he is lunatic, he's been running for more than 30 years from the clutch of the most advanced nation in the history of the world in MCU (since the time when T'Chaka, the father of T'Challa and the Black Panther before him, was on his peak), he is pure evil, fearless, and almost reminds you of Heath Ledger's Joker from Chris Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.So far, 'Black Panther' is the movie we all have been waiting for (mostly by the people of color since they have so little amount of heroes/heroines that are worthy to represent them and they can look up to) since the hero's conception in the 60s, or perhaps, way long before that: since the golden age of Hollywood at the 30s in which American movies reached its peak of storytelling that focuses on its heroes/heroines/protagonists portrayed mostly (if not all) by white males/females. Not too great to me, but not bad either. It's good for a solo-debut movie, and it's the right move to pave a way for something much, much bigger yet to come to the MCU, something that is written and can be clearly seen by all the audiences who can patiently wait until the very end of the movie: Black Panther will return in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR"
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,3/10,"I'm blown away at how disappointed I was when I finally got to watch this one via Netflix. I'll say it out front: it's incoherent. Sure, the sets and people look good. I especially like the edges on the silly spears the female troops use, but all that production value is tossed aside if not hitched to a comprehensible plot. Here, I am now halfway through the flick and have only the vaguest idea of what's going on. I'll give it another go this evening. I'm unsure if I'll start it again or continue from where I am in hopes something pulls things together for me. I understand the high ratings on this bomb. I too enjoy finally seeing black actors behave like humans instead of caricatures but surely it can be done in a better constructed vehicle."
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2018,6/10,"You know what this movie reminds me of? The Golden Child with Eddie Murphy, mixed with Coming to America... but not nearly as good.This movie is a joke. Nothing is believable at all. At least in Captain America and X-Men you could sit back and say ""ok, this integrated with reality quite well"". But the Black Panther is nonsense all around. How did this movie get hyped up so much?? This is ridiculous. I swear, if this movie wins an Oscar then it will be proof that the show is rigged.""Who challenges me?""
""I don't challenge you.""
""What about you?""
""I don't challenge you.""If no one is challenging no one then why is there such a huge focus on protecting Rwanda? Clearly there has been no threat forever.... why so much focus on preparing for war when there is no reason for it? Look at Iceland... they have not been at war with anyone in a long time, so the people are lax and not interested in war. How believable would it be to find out that they have the most powerful army on the planet? Jeeez.Who is Rwanda helping if it is a secret that Rwanda is so powerful?Why does this movie take all of the African stereotypes and exaggerate tf out of them without being ridiculed for such prejudice?? Smh."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,1/10,"This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...clich√© phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"This movie was a huge disappointment. It started slow, then rushed through the movie robing us of some great character insight. Michael B Jordan was a great villain, unfortunately Marvel ruined it by turning this tough contract killer into a clown. The jokes were few and far between and as out of place as a DC film. The action was bathe in bad CGI reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded. A great story was ruined with an unnecessary love story. I don't know why critics are turning their back on Blade and Spawn. these movies were the first black Superhero films. Spawn was also flawed, but even with it's shortcomings, it's a far better movie than this. Blade on the other-hand was extremely well done and Black Panther doesn't come close to capturing the action, energy or excitement of Blade. I really hated this film and Coogler had been on a streak. Who knows, Black Panther didn't impress me in Civil War either. He's strong in the comic books, but I honestly don't care for Chadwick Boseman. 42, Get on Up, Draft Day, all really bad films. This guy appear to be the black Shia Lebeouf. I guess Hollywood is planning to shove him down our throat like they are doing with Josh Gad. We are limited with strong black talent in Hollywood, that doesn't mean we should be using just anyone for pivotal role. My 5 stars for this film are generous."
BLACK PANTHER,23 November 2021,8/10,Amazing performance by Chadwick Boseman in a really fresh chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The 18th movie in the series and great to know they can keep it fresh and super fun. Marvel do love throwing in a line explaining why a whole advanced civilisation (or eternally powerful being) was not able to help in earlier movies. Wakanda Forever!
BLACK PANTHER,1 October 2018,4/10,"Having enjoyed all Marvel based films i started watching this with great expectations. As soon as Martin Freeman came on it was turned off. Why, why, why, why does the film industry trot out the same talentless dumwits who couldn't act in a pantomine?"
BLACK PANTHER,15 November 2019,4/10,"A very disappointing tale although visually very pleasing on the eye. Another thing - why oh why Martin Freeman, the man can't act for toffee!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,1 December 2019,10/10,"Oh Man I'm loving it. What an movie. One of the best Marvel Film ever. In this movie, Background music is stunning. Also, action sequence and costume looks excellent."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,5/10,"...and I'm just going to get right to it.The good:Acting was well done across the board. Visuals were amazing in spots and in others the CGI was clunky. Directing was OK and the production values were good.The not so good:There were some slow spots in this one...lots of them. Unlike most Marvel movies, this one seems to lack much of any sense of humor. I understand they are doing an origin story with the first film for BP...they spent way too much time on it. This may have worked well were this a stronger story, not so much here. Not to give too much away if you haven't seen it, entitled rich prince becomes king(and superhero), loses kingship then gains it back(along with powers and a suit), because he is...you know...entitled.Considering the time they spent developing this story I would expect that there would have been much more character development, but in this case it was sorely lacking. The ""villain"" is the most developed character in the film and ultimately the most likable having at least a motivation. The titular hero of the movie, aside from having been born the son of an absolute monarch, chowing down on the African equivalent of peyote, is not(in my opinion) well developed, relatable or especially likable. Other characters are 2D, but honestly still more likable than our hero.I wish I had skipped the big screen and waited for Netflix."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,4/10,"Such a shame. Was looking forward to enjoying this, psyched myself up for it , and low and behold. Not so great! The positive is that for black culture it's a milestone movie , a true celebration of culture and tradition set in the marvel universe. For the rest of us just a little boring. Performances were good for the most part, standard overacting and reasonable CGI. But gripping, no! I wonder if as may black people who saw this movie chose to vote , would Donald Trump be President?!?"
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2020,2/10,I didn't want to see this movie. The Black Panther character made zero impression on me during Captain America - Civil War. But like alot of people I watched it because the reviews were so positive.Despite my reservations I went into this movie with an open mind. That mind was quickly bored beyond belief and frustrated at the predictable politically correct plot. Casting an entirely African American group is a hollow gesture when the storyline and dialogue is so stilted and pathetic.If you take the novelty of the cast and some of the CGI out the rest of the movie is ALOT of talking about nonsense and some fight scenes.
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2019,10/10,Absolutely loved the visuals! The acting performances were superb for the most part and the wisecracks were very funny. Excellent movie!
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2020,2/10,"Seriously- if we have Black Vikings in Thor, Black Valkyries in Thor, why are the Wakandans all Black? Where's the diversity ?
Besides being boring, this felt like a 70's Black-sploitation movie.
I wish Hollywood would learn that Special Effects do not make a movie- a good plot does. And boring ? I literally fell asleep watching this ."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"I don't understand the low ratings and the snide remarks that some of the reviews are making about the actors in the movie, Black Panther. It's a comic book with real actors portraying comic characters! Why are there remarks regarding how unrealistic it is and how illogical some things are, it's a comic book! Nobody gets upset about Iron Man and the highly-advanced weapons and high-technological weapons that he uses, it's the same thing with Black Panther. Could it be because 95% of the actors in the movie are Black? Come on people, get over it! Not everyone in America (or Africa for that matter) is white! I enjoyed the movie and took it for what it is, a comic book!"
BLACK PANTHER,5 June 2018,8/10,"In such a multicultural society like the United States, it would be surprising if, sooner or later, in the pages of the popular comic book does not appear the first black superhero capable of on a par with Spider-Man, Thor and Iron Man to resist the threat of danger, experiencing the Earth's defense strength. There was such a significant event in the summer of 1966, when in the 52nd issue of the ""Fantastic Four"" magazine, from the filing of Wall and Lee Kirby appeared the proud T'challa, Crown Prince of the fictional African country Wakanda. The emergence of the superhero with a characteristic color, traditionally incredible abilities and characteristic behavior could not get past the various ethnic groups in America and soon T'challa popularity reached unprecedented heights and rapid, then it without much thought in a row the team the Avengers. And in spite of the fact that the prince, and then the full-fledged ruler of Wakid, was only one of the knights of the image of the ""Black Panther"", it was T'chall who became associated with fans of graphic novels with this character who had a great future ahead of him. Having firmly established itself as its own personal series of comic books, T'challa appeared consistently in so-called crossovers and even managed to lead a charming Storm under the crown, who agreed to become the second half of such an outstanding personality. In addition to participating in various kinds of print adventures, the hero repeatedly appeared in animated sketches from Marvel, reminding the audience that he is unique and can not be written off. And in the early '90s, when the shooting process technology began to show an unprecedented rise itself Wesley Snipes tried to present themselves before us in the guise of the ""Black Panthers"", but constant creative differences and other production problems at the root hacked promising ideas. And yet in the depths of Marvel no one was going to give up the opportunity to transfer the history of T'Challa to big screens. Of course, it took much longer than Stan Lee planned, and yet the ""Black Panther"" merged into a harmonious series of screened characters of the publishing house and rightfully took the leading positions in the Kino-Universe supervised by Kevin Feigi.Produced by Marvel for a long time tried to introduce T'challu an endless success story begun in Jon Favreau, ""Iron Man"", trying as gently as possible to bring to build a mythology movie, the universe for a meeting with an idol of the black community. And the best option was the invitation of T'Challa to the conflict, called the ""Civil War"". Friendly confrontation between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers gradually grew into by a serious, albeit not the most dramatic battle, and T'challa fully demonstrated its unique features, trying to avenge his father's untimely deceased in eternity. Played quite remarkable and not untalented actor Chadwick Bozeman character exuded confidence and unwavering despite the deep emotional conflicts tormenting his soul, managed to find a balance, thereby demonstrating the wisdom that came too early, but the world needs, more than ever before. In itself, the plot of the Civil War caused ambiguous feelings among Marvel fans, especially if we compare the scale of events in the movies with what was happening in the comics, but T'challa did not raise any doubts about the expediency of his appearance, and therefore Kevin Feigi gave the go-ahead on the shooting of the solo output of the ""Black Panther"" under the direction of Ryan Krugler, one of the most interesting directors with a dark complexion, who was obliged to feel with the history of T'challa kinship and show us previously unknown regions of the Movie Universe, to they are destined to play a significant role in the further development of the conflict under the sign of the ""Stones of Eternity"".
So, the plot of the film unfolds in a remote and closed African country Wakanda, which managed to reach unprecedented technological heights due to the myriad deposits of outlandish metal. Developing aside from the major world markets and, consequently, conflicts, Wakanda managed to preserve its identity and at the same time create an exemplary unity of the society in which conflicts start and are happening, but they can always be resolved by the affairs of honor. Entering the throne of a small but proud country, the young heir of the late King T'Chall (Bozeman) decides to continue the policy of isolating the Wakis for the benefit of their own people, never in need of anything, but events in the recent past compel the Black Panther to seriously reconsider their life position. The world was no longer as huge as it was some 10 years ago. Globalization, which picks up the Earth in a whirlpool of cosmic proportions, is also clinging to T'Challa's home, which among other things attracts scoundrels of various colors ready to sell their souls for the treasures and knowledge of the Wakid.Contrary to the specific geographical location of the ""Black Panther"", it does not feel at all camera and alien. Ryan Krugler's ribbon fits perfectly into the framework of the Marvel Cinema-Universe, showing a charming and, of course, embellished African flavor for the joy of a few tired of the monotony of the previous series of films to the audience. The title character in the invariable performance of Chadwick Bozeman is revealed to us on the best side, demonstrating an excellent physical form and ability to win back emotions that make him a living person, not a schematic heroic character. The actor became the real property of the ""Black Panther"", he skillfully plays out even the most difficult by the standards of Marvel dramatic scenes and manages to joke so that he is not ashamed of him. Of course, by the will of the fate of T'Challa has no right to be merry to the bone, as his country is torn by a serious conflict, but the game of Bozeman takes the hero out of the walls of gloomy reflections and volitional actions in order to show the true humanity of the ""Black Panther"". Thus, T'challa becomes almost the most interesting character of Marvel since the days of Tony Stark, and although there is not so much eccentricity in him, the hero completely takes the niche taken by Kevin Feigi. And the history of the ""Black Panther"" is filed so competently that not only African-American viewers will be able to fall in love with it, but also a different category of viewers. And all because Ryan Krugler, Chadwick Bozeman and the unchallenged curator Kevin Feigi understand what they need to do. Certainly, the film has strong ethnic roots, only for a skilfully told story that in fact has nothing to do. Regardless of skin color, each of us has the concept of beauty. And the ""Black Panther"" is proof that a tightly-shot movie will always find attention and become a favorite for millions.As a result, I want to say that the film by Ryan Krugler reveals wonderful beauties before us, reveals a serious layer of history, is not afraid of bold artistic decisions and at the same time gives Marvel audience a pleasant feeling of comfort. ""Black Panther"" is colorful, spectacular and epic. It does not violate the laws and stylistics of the Cinema-Universe, which also pleases. Of course, the authors would not be prevented from taking a partial example with the permissiveness of Taiki Vaitichi, the author of the third ""Torah"", but it is clear that Marvel is increasingly willing to trust the original vision of the directors and still give them the necessary sip of creative freedom. The Krugler tape is proof."
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2019,4/10,"Movie was produced well, but it was too slow and putting too much tribal drama in it. If this guy is a super hero then we need to get that into the picture. It was more like they were in the middle of a territorial war and that's all. Hey...we want some action, not just a few kicks with half the thrill. Some delivery here. I thought Boseman was a good actor for the job, but they hyped it beforehand and didn't deliver. You have to have a good script and quality delivery in each scene. Director, please take note."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,6/10,"Allow me to preface my review by saying I have loved all the previous Marvel Universe movies. However, I found Black Panther a yawnfest. It seemed to lack the feel of the other movies in the franchise and I was really struggling to watch all of it until the end. It was such a relief when those credits rolled.ActuallyI thought the acting was good but the plot was lacking. It seemed to be going nowhere very slowly most of the time. I couldn't relate to the characters either which meant I didn't like any of them. If they make a sequel, I hope it's at least interesting.Overall a disappinting effort from Marvel but I still look forward to the next installment."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,,This movie sucks. I think this film is a mockery of tribal people of Africa. They just keep vomiting the word technology like a Catholic priest.
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,5/10,"Very overrated movie with a mediocre plot and bad fightscenes that create zero 
excitement ."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,4/10,"Black Panther is a joke of a movie. Killmonger was the least insane person in it and they killed him because he told the truth then took his ideas and passed them on as their own. These people hide the secrets to prosperity away from the world and call anyone who doesn't live with them an ""outsider"". They determine their leaders via either birthright or by combat (extremely advanced stuff from the Wakandans). Maybe if they didn't just pick the strongest guy they could have had a leader with morals make some positive changes to the world, instead their xenophobia causes them to sit and watch people suffer and die all over but they choose to save a hobbit just because. Then the hobbit flies a plane-ship simulation and takes out Killmonger's aerial force by himself and all this time another ship is trying to kill him. The movie sets it up as a life or death decision for Mr. Baggins; choose to stay in the simulation and die fighting or leave and let the enemy win. He chooses to stay and fight but somehow gets out in the nick of time anyways; just a complete waste of time to even present the illusion of risk. Oh, and how the hell is the hobbit supposed to know how much time he has left when he's told ""shields are at 50%"", what does that even mean? Black Panther is stabbed in the abdomen and thrown off a waterfall but survives because a fisherman finds him and puts him in a snow bank. Killmonger decides to burn the flower that gives him power for some reason that still escapes me. There are so many plot holes that I was questioning my own ability to comprehend story structure. I'd rather not even get started on the War-Rhinos. The use of CGI was liberal to say the absolute least. Of course, there were some parts that looked cool but there were way more parts that you could tell were shot in front of a green screen. Most of the accents are terrible and almost none of the actors/actresses offer anything in terms of emotion. I would say it's a shame some smarter nation is going to take advantage of them and their Vibranium but it's really not, they deserve it. Then again Wakanda does have deus ex machina on their side so they'll probably be alright."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"For the time being, I have to say that I went into ""Black Panther"" with relatively few expectations. My love for superhero movies has become increasingly diminished over time. Not irresponsible of course is Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, which (especially ""The Dark Knight"") makes most MCU movies look like a kindergarten. Even in spite of the good feedback from the critics (88 Metacritic), I mainly went to the cinema with two friends to have an entertaining, not necessarily memorable Saturday evening in 3D. What makes Black Panther good? Obviously it's the visuals, which is something that seems to be really bombastic in many MCU movies. From the sound effects, to the well used CGI and the colorful camera shots, the visuals are really sensational. 
The film has a strong pacing and a good sense of urgency. It never drags. The action scenes are all strongly staged and also very exciting. Especially the Car Chase towards the beginning with the many camera angles, the great speed and entertaining gadgets. The black Panther Attire looked really great too. Surprisingly, the humor was actually solid. Of course, there were not the biggest laughs in here, but sometimes I could not resist the one or other grin. Black Panther also thrives on the really good acting performances. Surprisingly, I knew quite a few actors from the main cast. To be honest, none other than Martin Freeman & Daniel Kaluuya. For me, Andy Serkis was surprisingly cool as ""Ulysses Klaue"", who was really good at his job despite very little screen time. Chadwick Boseman as hero & protagonist plays well, but the real show stealer was his antagonist. Michael B. Jordan plays the villain in a very convincing but also authentic manner. Maybe the characters aren't all as memorable as in other Superhero movies, but the ensemble is bigger for that. So there is one or two (very superficial) Punch-In-The-Gut moments. 
""Black Panther"" also has a good dramaturgy. The scenery is fluidly designed and continues to build up systematically.
The great ""Epic"" film doesn't really emerge, but the final battle is staged together with the music score in a very exciting way. A lot of criticism (mainly from conventional audiences) that the film has had to deal with refers to the tribalism. Some see some kind of ""propaganda"" in here. Frankly, there may have been 1/2 minor implications or provocations regarding this problem, but nothing that put me personally out of the movie
What you have to notice is that the plot is, as with so many MCU movies, very predictable and partly repetitive.
The strands of action are put together quite unpretentiously. A lot of ""aha"" is not behind it, but in return, not much is done wrong. The storyline isn't that interesting and more or less very predictable.
The other points of criticism I would like to raise are closely related. The Character Delevopment did not exist in the end, because it was traded according to clich√©s and monotonous characteristics and therefore had a lot to do with continuous storytelling. The dialog was also quite constructed. Not bad in any way, just don't memorable or special.Does Black Panther have a high recognition value in the genre?
Yes, but also no.
The Parallel Society or even ""World"" of Wakanda is original and the visual and the atmosphere differs from other action flicks. Superficially seen ""Black Panther"" is therefore really unique. Nevertheless, many things like character development, dialogue, hero/villain relationship are quite repetitive and offer little to nothing special.
---
CONCLUSION: Black Panther is a visually sensational film with good pacing and strongly staged action scenes, but not really outstanding in its genre. It is really good at what he is supposed to be and fills the classic superhero formula with 1/2 squiggles. Is it as good as Christopher Nolan's Batman movies? No, for God's sake, of course not. Is it a movie you should watch at the cinema or maybe buy on Blu-Ray? Yeah.

BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,3/10,"Though I would LOVE to get into the sociopolitical connotations of this obvious ""token"" effort towards its obviously token character I, unlike Marvel Studios, am aware of what is appropriate and what is not. Marvel comics have been force-feeding ridiculous ethnic transformations of age old, sacred iconic characters down their fans' throats in lieu of creating new ones and steadily losing their fanbase. With sociopolitically injected efforts like this and the casting of a dark girl as Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok, and the new interracial love interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming, it looks like Marvel Studios is determined to follow suit. Was this film meant to evolve the character, or simply to placate the misrepresented? Because this ""made for tv"" quality theatrical release seemed as much of a ""token"" to the Marvel lineup as the character Token is to South Park. Rather than fill a crucial vacancy in our culture this effort seems more like salt in a wound. I'd expect significantly more from Marvel Studios since the ONLY reason they ever got off the ground to begin with was off the strength of a black character named BLADE. Anyone remember those films? A hell of a lot stronger than this insulting drivel! At least that dude was afforded the dignity of an actual narrative effort! How about some more of that, hm?... Where the hell is Night Thrasher and his New Warriors, or at least something else that doesn't make black people look like futuristic aliens? How is THAT supposed to dignify them? By capitalizing on differences further? Wow. Astonishing. And I have to wonder how it woyld have gone over to here the line ""Great, another white boy for us to fix..."" had the roles been reversed. Weak Marvel. Just weak..."
BLACK PANTHER,3 February 2019,10/10,"This film gives me chills, every time!! I'm currently watching it for the 20th time... this time, in the comfort of my own home. Everything about this movie just works. I love all of the actors involved -- all of their parts are integral to the propulsion of this vision. Ryan Coogler absolutely nailed it! It really is a MASTERPIECE.
Killmonger is, by far, THE greatest villain in the MCU. And he isn't exactly wrong in his motivations, either; he just goes about things in the wrong way. He has so much depth, and so many layers -- you can't hate him. I feel all of his emotions. I also empathise with him completely. I'm living for the sequel. Easily the best film in The MCU. Kevin Feige said so, too. I wholeheartedly agree.
Spectacular!!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,5/10,"I would recommend it for anyone wanting to view a movie with strong black characters and some rejection of stereotypes. It is rather brilliant on that aspect. However, if you're looking strictly for a super hero movie, you're going to be disappointed. The best action sequence is already in the trailer. Andy Serkis is completely wasted as a villain. He literally dies half way through the film, and not in any brilliant way. Every plot element has been used dozens of times before. They completely miss the opportunity to tell the back story of Erik Killmonger. Rather they explain it in narrative. They literally add a token white guy in Martin Freeman's character. He was totally irrelevant to the film, and you didn't feel like he connected Black Panther to the rest of the Avengers in any way. They make a point of mentioning he was a pilot, so you knew immediately that would play into the finale, but it is really forced.I really, really, had high expectations based on a superior marketing campaign. And I understand the over the top reviews based on the significance of a predominantly black cast. But this movie comes no where near matching onscreen the hype off screen. If you want to watch a really, really good Marvel movie, you'll have to wait."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,2/10,"I saw the trailer for this latest addition to the Marvel universe, I wasn't impressed. A friend wanted to see it and I thought I would give it a shot. 
The director/writer pulled out the Marvel hero playbook/check list and stock piled all the clich√©d traits/story plots for a ""compelling"" story but as any ""good"" cook knows, having the right ingredients doesn't guarantee a great meal. 
There are many fine actors in this piece, including Chadwick as the hero-guy. BUT, being a good actor doesn't mean you have the ability to carry a film as a lead. Hollywood of old used to call it the ""it"" factor, a better word would be charisma. Jordan as the heavy does have the ""it"" factor, which is not good for the film to have the villain with more than the hero.
This film was simply BORING. Half way through I felt relief because I thought we were nearing the end, but it was when the hero was seemingly defeated so I was painfully reminded we were only in the last half of the 2nd act. ARG! 
I was not engaged with the characters, except the villains. Bad for the audience and the film. Lots of moments for emotional peaks in the story that some how fall short... thus unsatisfying. The ""humour"" falls flat. I am sure an actor with the proven chops of a Robert Downey could have made them work but in the hands of the director the actors did not seem to reach their full potential. Forest Whitaker gave a very over the top performance, a sin for any actor, getting caught at acting. 
I could go on and on with trivial bits of annoyance like lines spoken as there being no better sunsets as seen in the hero's isolationist nation... I guess a sunset off the Fiji coast pales by comparison???"
BLACK PANTHER,5 October 2019,7/10,"Black Panther is one of the MCU's most extraordinary films. Ryan Coogler's tense superhero adventure breaks with conventional genre and does not deliver a movie of controversial topics
just shy, but puts the focus.7,5"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"After 18 movies the MCU has delivered a spectacular surprise - Black Panhter. His debut in Civil war was one of the highlights of the movie, and everyone wanted to see him in action in his own movie. And here we are, faced with a very good action adventure that deals with extremely difficult questions and intends to have a great cultural impact. Now, that sounds a lot for an MCU movie, an unfortunately, it is.The thing that makes Black Panther a good movie is the acting, the visuals, the story and political-cultural critique of the modern day world. The acting is in every way superb with one exception. Boseman was, in regard to everyone else, overthrown. His acting is really, really good, but the problem is that he had to compete with the likes of Whitaker, Basset, Nyong'o, Jordan and (the great and powerful) Serkis. Not only does he find himself a little in the shadow of such great names, but certain newcomers such as Gurira do such a brilliant job that the main character actually becomes a little less interesting. But, do not mistake that fact with the fact that he does not act out the main protagonist in style - he does, and he does it very very well. On the other hand, Jordan dominates every scene with such ease it is almost disturbing. He is intimidating, dangerous, and has a great shift from a gangster looking and sounding persona to a legitimate Marvel villain halfway through the movie. His only problem was Serkis who, in many ways stole the movie. It is more fun to watch how much fun he had playing his character that one actually forgets to observe the surrounding story. Crazy, entertaining, fun and really the only character that stays with you long after the movie ends. On the other hand, Freeman did such a routine job that it almost hurt to see. He does function as a supporting character but seems disinterested and distant in many ways. A shame.The visuals were impressive. The colors and contrasts of the Wakandan city to the bleak standard city depictions, the traditional African wardrobe and breathtaking scenery really make Black Panther worth more than just one watch. The musical background fulfills the ambient of the movie and gives every scene another layer of depth. So, the movie does have an atmosphere worth noticing.The main problem with Black Panther is the fact it tries to deal with extremely important modern day problems (immigration, gun control, racism etc.). Now, the problem is that MCU has a way of portraying difficult subjects in a lighthearted manner. Black Panther is not lighthearted (thank God), but still does not pass that necessary boundary to make it a difficult and important movie. Passing that boundary is risky and does not always pay off (e.g. BvS Dawn of justice), but after 18 movies and such a fan base, a little risk should not present a problem. Simply noticing in a sentence or two problems of immigration (""If we let them in, they bring their problems with them..."") or gang related shootings (""No tears for me?"" ""Nah, that's just how things go around here.""), accompanied by a minute or two of heartwarming scenes is not enough. It is noteworthy, but more should have been done. The director does a marvelous job at that, but I fear studio interference took it's tole here.Another great problem this movie tries to discuss is the conflict of traditional and modern day views. It is, maybe, the heart and soul of Black Panther but it feels a bit undone. It is unknown if this can be pinned to the problems of the script or the direction. Knowing how Coogler makes his movies (e.g. Creed), I'll go with script. This problem feels one dimensional, and it should not be. This is a problem that plagues the Middle east today, and dealing with it in such a way does not do it justice. That combination should have been explored more, worked out more, and the overall impact the movie would have had, would have been far greater.All in all, Black panther is an improvement over the last few MCU movies. It establishes a direction that was much needed after the catastrophe that way Ragnarok, and seems like a transitional movie towards the Infinity wars. Superbly acted, decently written, greatly directed, but flat and one dimensional at points when dealing with difficult subjects. Well done. Really well done."
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2018,2/10,"A poor story, little to get you hooked from the off. Took ages to get going and I turned it off after 35 minutes. I like a good marvel movie but this a Poor attempt and honestly no idea how this is 7.4"
BLACK PANTHER,26 December 2020,4/10,"I don't think I ever watched a film with a more frequent use of a green screen.
The effects are ridiculous for a big budget movie.
Story feels like it was written by a 5-year old.
Oooh and the Hollywood agenda ...the cast chosen here, my lord that was bad."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Yes, the hype surrounding Black Panther has everything to do with the all-black cast, black director, black screenwriters, etc. But at the same time, this movie is going to be looked upon as a landmark in African American cinema. (I'm not the best person to explain why, but if you are interested, I recommend the video ""Black Panther is blacker than you thought"" by Screen Junkies News. I'm not afiliated with them. Just thought it was a good video.)As a popcorn movie, Black Panther is okay. Thor: Ragnarok serves better as a popcorn movie. But, being familiar with Ryan Coogler's previous work, I wasn't expecting this to be a action-filled blockbuster. I went in expecting him to have some profound things to say. And I thought he did have a lot of interesting things to say.1. I am very used to watching Euro-centric fantasy. So getting to see an Afro-centric fantasy that was markedly difference was a strange and refreshing experience. Black Panther falls under this niche genre of Afro-futurism, one of the aspects of which is to imagine what Africa could have been without the influence of colonialism. This, I thought, made for a great genre for speculation and world-building. And the world of Wakanda, with its 5 tribes with their distinct cultures and clothes and customs, was a vivid and immersive experience.2. A lot of the weight of the movie comes from the fact that it is from an African perspective rather than an American one. Imagine what the story might have been like from an American perspective. Say, five years ago, if you heard we were going to get a fantasy story set in Africa told from an American perspective (but let's say it wasn't based on the Black Panther comics), you might expect something like this: An African American kid from the inner city learns that his father was a prince from a technologically advanced African nation that stays hidden from the world. He trains himself to become strong and then travels there. he makes a challenge from the throne. And when he becomes king, he vows to fight against the oppression that black people face all over the world. Sounds like an inspirational fantasy, no? Except that's not what it feels like to all those other countries who are not the USA. At the end of the day, Erik Killmonger is an American go goes into an African nation and overthrows the government. Like America does. Like America has done. America is not viewed as a hero across the globe.3. After his experiences with Killmonger, King T'Challa is forced to consider his priviledge and he wonders whether he has a responsibility to use his knowledge and wealth to help the poor, the downtrodden, the refugees. What a powerful way for Ryan Coogler to speak directly to the most powerful nations of our world. (There is also a little but of commentary on how present-day Africans, especially the ones who are wealthy and priviledged, often look down upon and do not sympathize at all with the plight of those of African descent in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean. It hardly ever gets talked about, but it happens.)4. Lastly, this movie had the best representation of women I have ever seen in any fantasy. You have 4 prominent female roles and they are each allowed to be different. They each have their own ideas, own views, beliefs, and convictions, and their own sense of purpose. They are similar in some ways and different in others. Some of them represent the traditional side of Wakanda and some of them represent the progressive side and their interactions reflects the struggle Wakanda faces in balancing the two. Each of them - Shuri, Okoye, the queen mother, and Nakia are fully fleshed out characters. And because there are so many of them, the female representation does not come down to only one person who then gets picked apart. Becaue there's four them, they each get to be different and diverse. I understand that to most audiences, these reasons above aren't why they go to the movies. And so it's completely understable why all of this commentary doesn't factor in to their enjoyment of the film. I happen to be part of that group of audiences who enjoy the heck out of commentary, especially when it is doen masterfully and about a topic that appeals to me. That's why the movie had such a big impact on me."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,6/10,"As an Avengers comics fan, I always had some interest for the Black Panther, which was a mix of interesting elements: Enhanced physicality, hi-tech and royal matters - royal matters in Africa! The film plays well on these elements. I like the fact that Wakadans were divided, and not divided along a clear good/evil line, but divided along actual polemic elements like interventionism vs isolationism. All was not so clear cut which I think is a good point. If I were black, I would wonder about the ""hope from the above tribe"" message here, given that no such ""above tribe"" exists. Maybe it deals in ideals rather than hope - for they are much different. The cinematography was well, but there was a problem with the tempo, a problem that makes it that its rythm is regular. Actors were okay, with the one playing the ""General"" being excellent in terms of acting and appearance. Images of modern Wakanda were amazing and different if a bit PC in their representation. The look of the ""Gorilla"" tribe's settings was awesome.On the other hand, the most interesting vilain is lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. The fight scenes, especially the one between the two Panthers, are lacking in imagination and drama. The costumes, especially the one the Panther wears, looks a bit over-done.All in all this is a movie that's with Iron Man 2 and Thor dark World rather than with Civil War or Ragnarok - a bit of a harduous movie, that will hopefully set the terrain for a better second chapter. That being said, it's still entertaining."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2019,7/10,"Here's my review of black panther . So Chadwick boseman reprises his role as tchalla and he was great ! The supporting cast with less vowels in their names were good too . Now my favorite character , killmonger of course , it's no surprise Michael b jordan is in every Ryan coogler movie . This movie felt very isolated from the rest of the mcu movies , sure movies like Thor Ragnarok have introduced us to new worlds. But wakanda is just so magnificent and isolated from the rest of the mcu . This movie has a soundtrack that is so good you can buy the vinyl stereo CD for it . The score is a rush of adrenaline and has a lot of goosebumps along. This movie gave off the vibe of lion King in a lot of places and had a lot of cliches like the ""fallen King shall rise"" sort of ones. But unlike any other hyped movie , It has phasing issues , but the last act makes up for all the slow scenes. In the end , black panther was awesome ! It had great characters , nail biting action , and in a very long time in superhero movies , the bad guy has a great motive. In short it's blood diamond meets batman ."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2019,3/10,David S. Lee was the only redeeming part of this film. While I did like some of the 007 level technology - it was another movie overburdened with special effects and overproduced action scenes. This really was the Fast & the Furious of the Marvel movies. As far as the Oscar nomination - it was a film to keep the commoner interested in the show. No different than when Mad Max was nominated in 2016. Obviously the politics behind the nomination didn't hurt.
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,7/10,"I'm happy for 'Black Panther.' Money talks, and right now the film's box office dominance is sending a powerful and culturally important message to Hollywood and beyond. Stories of all colors and stripes are waiting to be told, and cinema fans are pining for fresh takes and innovative ways to convey those tales.However--one way or the other--box office results should never be mistaken for a barometer of a film's quality. 'Black Panther' brings the fictional nation of Wakanda to life while shining a bright light on a handful of social justice issues that desperately need to be addressed. 
 I particularly like their bad-ass female version of the Praetorian guard. 
 But in end, those highlights aren't enough to overcome the handful of illogical moments scattered throughout the plot, the hewing of action scenes towards a more juvenile audience, and the frequently lame dialogue in which Michael B. Jordan's character is easily the worst offender."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2020,10/10,This movie is incredible! There's so many good things about it - if you're reading this you must watch it! It's an action packed joy ride!
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2020,6/10,It's incredible. They are so rich and so backward.
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,10/10,"Fans have been begging for years to have Marvel bring the world's first ever black superhero to life on the big screen, and Marvel finally brought Black Panther into the massive Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) through 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', a film which showcased how flawlessly Black Panther could work in film. It was clear that Marvel had a new hit character on their hands, but with the release of Black Panther, I don't think even Marvel had any idea the social impact the film would create. Black Panther (BP) is more than a studiously entertaining superhero film, more than another superb entry into the MCU; Black Panther symbolizes a prominent political statement, a celebration of culture, an enormous racial representation in superhero films and does it all while delivering one of Marvel's most enjoyable films to date.Marvel could not have chosen a better director/writer than Ryan Coogler, who pieced together a story like none we've seen before in the MCU, a story which is as firmly grounded and thought provoking as it is entertaining. The revelation of the fabled fictional city of Wakanda kick starts the entire story and the film uses its main setting as a vessel into the overall narrative and the characters which inhabit it. Wakanda is truly like a character of its own. The believed-to-be third world county holds a nearly endless supply of the world's most treasured resource, vibranium, which is literally the centerfold around the entire plot and Coogler uses the fictional country to his advantage. Wakanda is easily one of the most enthralling settings I've ever seen in a superhero film and the story feeds off it greatly.The main narrative oozes with profound themes, exploring real-world issues like isolationism, the costs of colonialism and more, while delivering the exceptional spectacle of a fantastical adventure/fantasy film. There's the insanely advanced technology and superpowers, but it's running through a still somewhat primal, strongly traditional country, and Coogler mixes these elements to near perfection. The movie progresses at a stellar pace, providing well-executed plot twists along the way and eventually bringing its story full circle in a satisfying fashion. There's still sprinkles of that classic Marvel humor, but with a grounded plot, there's more commitment to serious storytelling which is a huge welcome after 2017 was full of comedy-heavy Marvel films. Black Panther is sincerely a tremendous three acts of engaging storytelling and Coogler deserves a great deal of praise for executing such a captivating story.Black Panther boasts a set of characters more interesting and engaging than arguably any MCU film before it, a strength which propels BP's story to the next level. We see T'Challa's story arc that was launched in Civil War continue here, the struggle of becoming the next king of Wakanda while wrestling with potential division in his own country. T'Challa is a complex, expertly-written lead character whose portrayal by superstar Chadwick Boseman is full of dedication and swagger. Following this dazzling outing, Black Panther is one of the MCU's best characters without question. Opposite T'Challa is a villain who arguably climbs into Marvel's top three villains thus far. Erik Killmonger presents one of Marvel's most emotionally engaging villains yet. Killmonger's story is equally as interesting as any other character; he presents understandable motives and is a grounded, realistically written villain for our current real world. Michael B. Jordan delivers a spectacular performance as T'Challa's nemesis, the stand out character of the whole film. Black Panther separates from other recent superhero films by giving its main character a true loyal alliance to feed off, which is where the aforementioned set of characters come into play. Wakanda's all-female special force leader, Okoye (Danai Gurira), T'Challa's tech-genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and his ex, now Wakandan spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) not only lead the way of a rock solid supporting cast but help give even more proper representation of powerful women in the MCU. Each character is formidable and simply entertaining, and all played wonderfully by their respective actresses. What's such a true victory for BP in the character department is that the auxiliary characters run even deeper. The star power is overwhelming; Sterling K. Brown, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker all are simply eccentric. As secondary characters, they may not get loads of screen time, but these characters all fill Wakanda to make it, and the movie, feel alive and full of an actual culture. Even further, Andy Serkis is vexingly gripping as Ulysses Klaue as his narrative thread continues from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Martin Freeman is a delightfully heartwarming surprise, reprising his role of Everett Ross. This stunning company of rounded, enticing characters is a vitally underrated aspect of Black Panther, and the acting cast is one for the ages.It's easy to stay brief while discussing action and visuals in Marvel films, since their track record is one of the best in those departments. Black Panther is a visual treat. The astounding mix of traditional African culture and futuristic technology found in Wakanda make way for a show stopping atmosphere, filled with eye-popping colors and superb costume design. The CGI is gorgeous and even better with the mix of Marvel's amazing practical effects. More impressive to me, however, was the audible side of the film. MCU movies always have a solid, if safe score to work behind the acting but BP takes a great stride towards more recognizable scores. Like the visuals, the mix of traditional African drumming through djembes among others with the modern hip-hop of Kendrick Lamar, is emotionally riveting, giving intensity to the action scenes. Said action sequences are nothing short of fun; anchored by uniquely written situations and high-level choreography, the action is simply a blast.This film has it all. The gloriously stunning atmosphere of Wakanda provides an enthralling visual and audible experience which is equally immersive and unique. From the top billed position to the supporting cast, there's not one weak link in the set of characters, which is loaded with premiere acting talent all the way through. Director Ryan Coogler makes his mark not only on the MCU, but on the film industry with a thematic story, which celebrates culture and delivers a down right fun and entertaining superhero flick to boot. With Black Panther, Marvel Studios continues to prove that the MCU is like a fine wine whose films only are getting better with age, and this adventure to Wakanda will stand the test of time as not only a spectacular superhero film, but as a legitimate, effective societal statement.10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,3/10,"I only watched this film due to a review of the 'must see' movies of 2018, I have to say I was disappointed. I think in many respects this was a missed opportunity to create something completely different in the Marvel pantheon. The initial premise of having mainly black actors and a strong female presence is laudable, but sadly I felt this became simply a token gesture. I think the cultural and political messages could have been much stronger and this would have created a far more absorbing and challenging storyline. Some other reviewers expressed disappointment in the fight scenes and poor cgi; this didn't bother me too much, but at times it felt very derivative and a regurgitation of set pieces from other films, and at times became all a bit Lord of the Rings. All in all, I felt the film lacked the depth and inventiveness that it promised and if it had been a bit more daring, could have added a new perspective to this genre."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"After watching Guardians 3, I told myself that Black Panther would be the last MCU film I'd watch. For one, I had become a DC fanboy, and two, the MCU formula had gotten pretty stale and repetitive. But, after seeing Civil War, I kept remembering Black Panther, and the fact that his father had been killed, leaving him as the new ruler of the mysterious Wakanda. That could set up something great for a Black Panther movie. If the teaser was at least half good, I'd see it. Not only was the teaser and the second trailer great, but the actors chosen blew my mind. Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Michael B. Jordan, all great choices.The story: Following the assassination of king T'Chaka in Civil War, T'Challa is the new king of Wakanda, the mysterious nation that's hiding untold treasures and technological Marvels. The story follows T'Challa rise to become worthy as king, all the while having to face off against a new enemy, Eric Killmonger, who plans to take the throne, his power and his secrets,I love the look of Wakanda; the culture shows that while Wakandan's are technologically advanced, they also integrate that into their culture and clothing. I think Ryan Coogler did a great job with the look and feel of Wakandan culture. Some of the new characters are great editions. T'Challa's mother Ramonda, his sister Shuri, his best friend W'Kabi. I even enjoyed Nakia, Nyong'o's character. Shuri had to be my favourite, and I really liked all the tech she created; that projection/hologram suit she made was amazing. I also enjoyed the Dora Milaje, the all women guard T'Challa had; you really feel their devotion and loyalty to Wakanda.But yes, there are things I was disappointed with in this film, one way or the other. One thing I was disappointed about was how little we got to see of T'Challa's kingship. All the advertisement is telling you ""his time is now"", ""get ready for a new king"". I was watching this film waiting for T'Challa to ""take charge"" and show us why he's worthy, but the only real thing that makes him worthy I guess is that he's royalty. I wanted something like Thor where he's stripped, and proves himself worthy but sacrificing his life. I guess we have that by the end, but I wanted that to be his whole character arc. Overall, he's crowned king after beating this Ape tribe leader in a duel, goes to capture Klawe at a casino, and immediately faces Killmonger, loses, is revived, and goes back to defeat him. That's all well and good, but I needed something more than that to scream ""he's the true, inspiring king we need"". If the last 20 minutes are defining that, then some, naming I, was a little disappointed.Overall, an entertaining movie, and interesting edition to the MCU. I love Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. I love the look of Wakanda, Vibranium, and all the technology Wakanda is hiding. T'Challa could have been developed a bit more, but at least I care about his character now. Even though this film didn't win me back to the MCU, I'm glad I watched it. Wouldn't really watch it again though.I'm giving this a 7 out of 10"
BLACK PANTHER,25 September 2018,2/10,"I suppose if you are 10, this is a great movie. I expected more. The hype around this movie made me want to watch it and I got about an hour into it on Netflix, free thanks (?) and turned it off. Boring.
It was a poor mixture of Avatar and other comics but this, it was made very poorly. You could see the effects were in front of numerous green screens, the flying machines were poorly done, the costumes were colorful. The plot was predictable, father is killed or died and son takes the lead. I was rooting for the bad son that was left behind in the hood but he couldn't pull it off either. He just couldn't blend in.
Lots of Hollywood names but they couldn't do much for the movie. I liked the kings sister with the techno stuff but Forest Whitaker? Was he bored or looking for something to do? He's so much better than this and so was Angela Bassett.
If you are a young kid, enjoy, otherwise, take a big pass on this bomb."
BLACK PANTHER,29 December 2020,3/10,"Having grown up in the DC comics era, I did not really know the Marvel universe. My granddaughter. She wanted to watch a Marvel movie and I asked what was the best. She said this was it. Well, her opinion and mine are vastly different. Lack of character development, lack of plot and sub par action scenes abound.Seems like they tried to put together a film based on other winners. It reminded me of Star Wars and Spiderman throughout. Add in an agenda and you have a loser of a movie. I have no idea how this movie got am overall 7+ rating. Ther are better choices."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"Let me get right to the point. Among the Marvel movies, Black Panther is one of the least successful productions. It's not so much that it lacks any of the major elements of other Marvel films. It has a superhero who kind of has special powers, it has special effects, and it has somewhat innovative fight scenes. No, the problem is in the acting and I'll put the blame for this on the supporting female characters. Their acting is of B-movie quality. It is wooden and stilted causing a lack of any believable emotional connection to other characters in the film. In an effort to make the female characters into powerful male-like warriors, they have sacrificed their humanity,Most of the male acting is only slightly better. Chadwick Boseman is okay. Michael B. Jordan is a pretty good villain, and Daniel Kaluuya is believable and sincere. But when Sterling K. Brown appears in a cameo, we realize what real good acting consists of and we are suddenly forced to realize what the film is missing. The plot is predictable, like most Marvel films. It seems to lack some underlying ideal, although it makes an attempt to do this in the conversation we see with Mr. Panther and his father, played very well by John Kani. In the conversation, his father advises him to surround himself with good people, which may serve as an indirect criticism of the corruption that so often appears in African governments. We also have the issue raised by Erik Killmonger (Jordan) who asserts that Wakanda should give its precious super- mineral, vibranium (give me a break), to oppressed black people so that they can fight their oppressors. Much is made in the pre-release hype about the technologically-advanced, mythical African nation, Wakanda. To me, it looked like Oz's Emerald City without the emerald. There is also a lot of talk on how this film unites black people around the world. Maybe it does. It just seems to me there are so many other films that could do a better job at this and keep us entertained at the same time. In short, there is not much in this film that will keep the average viewer involved. There are some mildly interesting fight scenes and the obligatory car chase has some novel elements, but I would not recommend the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the momentum the film has received from the pre-release media storm will no doubt end up with it making some good box office returns: A triumph of marketing over quality."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2021,8/10,"It has great characters, a deep story and amazing world to explore."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,6/10,"Well, i got to hand it to Marvel, though not always delivering great films, they manage to always stay on the right side of mediocre. I love the quality of their films, they more or less always look great, and in their films we constantly see great performances and witness memorable moments. But some of their films have stories and plots that can become somewhat predictable and washed down.This is unfortunately the case with Black Panther, it is a really gorgeous film, and it has some good performances, but nothing like we saw in for example Thor Ragnarok, where Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum delivered really memorable performances and are great villains, or Kurt Russel in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. This movie lacks a memorable villain like these.But it's not Jordan's fault, he plays the part really well, and might be the one that delivers the best performance in the entire film. But the character he plays simply isn't all that interesting or deep, and combined with a plot that is quite predictable, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect will happen, does indeed happen.But of course, the movie has it's moments, there are many scenes that are hands down great. And some action sequences are really well orchestrated, for example a long one shot action scene inside a casino, which was quite good. And there are plenty of short scenes that brings the giggles and puts a small break in the action scenes.The strongest part of the film is the visuals, it's quite obvious this movie cost a lot of money, though DC managed to spend 300.000.000$ on Justice League, and that movie looks horrible. Maybe Marvel just know how to spend their money more efficiently. But i wished they could have come up with a better story for Wakanda, though they did manage to establish the soul of T'Challa, we now know him, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, which is exactly why i recommend you to see this film.Though not by any means a perfect movie, far from it, it's still a worthy entry into the marvel universe, but don't expect any surprises, this is a straight forward film, but it's an important stepping stone before the majestic Infinity War enters theaters in about 2 months, which is not only the most expensive film ever made, but also the movie with most A list stars ever made. And it's nice to know all the character's that will face Thanos.TL;DR - Great visuals, weak story, predictable plot, not very exiting villain.6/10 - Fair"
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2019,6/10,"Entertaining,visually pleasing,good action,not overwhelmingly good,but reasonably ok."
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2020,7/10,"Black Panther is a solid, good movie. Nothing less, nothing more. I wasn't as impressed by it as with some other MCU movies, and there were definietly a few flaws, mainly in the action and CGI department. That being said, the positives in this movie most definietly outweigh the negatives. The plot is engaging and showcases the fictional culture of Wakanda nicely. I liked how different it felt than other movies in the MCU, and how it was more about internal political struggles rather than The End of the Entire World as we Know it. The characters are great as well, T'Challa and Erik were both nicely fleshed out, and the side characters were mostly good as well. The chemistry between them all is very delightful. The pacing is solid as well, and so are the emotional moments. I have a few problems with the movie though. The cgi is way too overused at some points, especially the final fight scene. The action itself also feels a bit stiff, the fighting feels a little too slow and unimpactful. The movie also tries to be funny at some points, which more often than not feels extremely tedious. Still though, those flaws aren't enough to make the movie bad, not in the slightest. It's a well told, well written, pretty powerful story that ties nicely into the MCU storyline, and I have no regrets about watching it."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2021,9/10,"Reviewing late but this was amazing and enjoyable. Loved the story. I love MCU movies, so this was amazing and worth watching.I am not a critic so maybe i cannot judge it like people are doing and giving it 5, 4, 3 out of 10 . This movie was really amazing if you like Sci-Fi and MCU movies."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2019,8/10,"I worked at a theater when Black Panther came out. We thought it would be big as most Marvel movies are, but it ended up being 10x bigger that we planned on.This movie is for sure one of the most culturally important movies to be released in the MCU. I will admit that aspect caused it to be a bit overrated in the long run, but it is still as great and solid entry into the MCU.Black Panther was introduced in Civil War as a side character. It was clear he was going to have his own origin movie and Wakanda was finally going to appear in the MCU. This movie starts not too long after Civil War as T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned King of his nation.For a movie called Black Panther, honestly the lead is probably one of the weaker aspects of it. It's really his allies and the villain that shine in this movie. His sister and the head of the King's guard are easily the best two characters in the movie. They're really fun and lighten the mood what could be a painfully boring movie. The villain when he comes into light is probably the 2nd best MCU baddie after Thanos. Even Andy Serkis as Ulysses Claue makes a return from ""Age of Ultron"" and is so much damn fun to watch. It's really all the characters surrounding T'Challa that make this movie so entertaining. Without them, this movie would have been much worse off.It has some really stellar action scenes, especially the casino/car chase in the middle. It's a shame that the final battle is so poorly done. I'm not sure if it was because Marvel wasn't sure if BP would do well, so they cut the budget on the CGI for the final battle, but it just wasn't up to snuff with other movies like Winter Soldier or Civil War. The CGI battle between Killmonger and T'Challa on the train tracks looked really bad.Besides the lackluster finale, Black Panther is still a really great movie and a welcome change of pace in the MCU. It has a villain with real conviction and a great cast of side characters. Culturally, this movie was probably even bigger than Infinity War and it makes sense. It was just missing something to make it as top notch as Winter Soldier, Civil War, or Infinity War. I do hope for a sequel to improve upon this. Maybe a quality bump similar to Captain America 1 to 2."
BLACK PANTHER,30 November 2018,5/10,"This movie wasn't that good to begin with.
It amazes me when RT thinks that it's the best MCU movie ever made.DEPTH
It didn't have a lot of depth.
It feels like they are trying to go deep when it comes to morals by bringing oppression when it comes to the villains ideologi but they executed it poorly.
Most of the depth they where trying to show where minimal and they never made you think.
This movie was really simple the ""depth"" that was shown consisted of someone saying that this is bad and why and the other say ""This aint bad cause the benefits are this"" that's all nothing more it is.CHARACTERS
The characters are really bad.
T'Challa is very bland character with no charisma at all and he has no depth when it comes to him.
He dosen't develop as a character and he never grows into something better.
There is minimal History shown behind this character and his desire is to be a good king, The villain is mediocre i will talk about him later, and nothing changes with him cause his desire to be king is so minimal cause he is pretty much a good king.
He shouldn't be a good king he should be a flawed king that want's to do good and become better.
But he is a good king cause they never show his flaws as a king he basically knows what he is gonna do as king.
And he is also op he kan never get hurt cause even Vibranium wont give him a scratch and if people hit him repeatedly he could just send a big wave that makes everyone fly away.
The suspense is gone when they do that and we never have the feeling of ""will he make it?"".
The side characters are bland as well and they lack depth.VILLAIN
The villain is mediocre
His motivation is help the helpless by starting a war.
It's not a bad motivation but it never gets developed and that's what makes him a pretty bland villain lack of development behind motivation.ACTION
The action is really well choreographed in my opinion it kept my interest.
But the final battle was horrendous and bland as hell it had no creativity into it just a bland fist fight.CGI
The CGI was terrible whenever it kicked in stuff felt out of place specially in the final battle that's when the cgi where at it's worst.VERDICT
The movie is overrated as hell i'ts just some mediocre Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2019,6/10,This movie is good but overly praised. The cgi in the 3rd act is really bad. Like Killmonger as the villains but love Andy Sirkis as Klaue. Wakanda world building is great. Love the ceremonial battles in the movie. It can drag a bit but still a good movie just overly praised.
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2019,6/10,This movie is a good solo movie for Black Panther but a little over hyped. Killmonger is a good villain but Klaue is a GREAT villain. Sucks that they killed both off. The sequence in South Korea is excellent and the 3rd act is kinda trashy with awful cgi. Overall though thought the movie was good especially the ceremonial battles but not as good as everybody is saying.
BLACK PANTHER,21 October 2018,5/10,I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"Marvel has been on a streak of good superhero and I'm pretty sure they managed to outdo their work compared to DC Comics. Seeing Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was amazing and I was looking forward to seeing him in an actual film.So this takes place right after Captain America Civil War when T'Challa returns back to this nation Wakanda after his father dies in an attack. While there, he decides to take his throne and rule Wakanda until suddenly a powerful enemy N'Jakada invades the nation and has intentions of destroying Wakanda. How T'Challa defeats N'Jakanda and protects the nation of Waanda is basically what this film is all about.Creed fame Ryan Coogler introduces a superhero film also ""the first black superhero"" of marvel (not racist but praising Marvel for their generosity of how much respect they're showing towards human race). His script was abit of a dissapointment because the movie had a very predictable story and eventually after 45 minutes of the film, the audience will for sure find out what will happen to N'Jakanda. The pacing was a bit slow but that still doesn't shy away for mbeing a perfect.Luckily there things that were integral to Black Panther such as showing a science fictional version of Africa to traditional clothing. The VFX was fantastic and that is all hats off to MS (Marvel Studios). The look of Busan and Wakanda was just commendable and delightful to watch on the big screen. The action was well choreographed and seeing Marvel with their remarkable efforts doesn't lack justice.Acting was a phenomenon. Chad Boswick playing T'Challa/Black Panther will just knock your socks off. He was exhilirating and edgy which proves how he is superhero material. Michael B Jordan was the major highlight of the film and his villainous attempt as N'Jakande shows a perfect match of subtlety. Lupita Noyong'o and seeing her as the African spy was defintiely worth devouring espcially how she manages to come clean with ther accent.Overall, this film may not be perfect because of the average writing but the entertainment of it is something the audience should go and experience. 3.75/5 - Atleast it is a perfect film for the audience."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2018,9/10,"""Black Panther"" (2018) is an action science fiction about an African prince named T'Challa, played by Chadwick Boseman, as he takes the throne of Wakanda and the role of Black Panther after his father is murdered on U.S. soil. His throne becomes threatened after a mistake made by his father comes back to haunt the kingdom and challenge the throne. I can honestly say, ""I love this film."" Even though I have never been to Africa, it gave me a sense of pride. I did find it odd that a society so advanced would resort back to primitive battle to challenge the throne. The visuals were magnificent with only a handful of the stunt effects appearing cartoonish. Even though the film is about T'Challa and Wakanda, I am enjoyed the different layers within the story. It helped to provide sufficient backstory to certain characters without detracting from the main storyline. Ryan Cooglar did an outstanding job bringing this comic book story to life.The acting in this film was phenomenal. I believe everyone's own flavor added to their character, especially Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan of ""Creed."" I thought I would be annoyed at the portrayal of African dialect, but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, this film is amazing. The actors pull you into the story through their superb performances and embracing of the character. The landscape visuals are magical, and the action scenes provide adrenaline even though there are a few flaws. The story instills a sense of pride through its science fiction that I have never experienced before. I highly recommend this film for its comic ties and gripping storyline."
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2020,5/10,"If you want to know what an ethno-state is, this is the movie for you."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,8/10,"This is not so much a review as a reminder that there was a sacred Native American site, Waconda Springs. Google it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,"When I saw Black Panther in ""Civil War,"" I seriously hoped he'd appear again, and when I heard they were making a film about him, I was thrilled. The glowing reviews added to my excitement. The pluses are that the villain has a rational reason to want revenge, and he wants to stop the oppression of black people. (Sure, he wants to trigger a global race war, but nobody's perfect.) So the plot revolves around real-world issues, not some abstract Nyah-hah-hah take-over-the-world scheme. But the basic premise is preposterous, that you can hide a nation more technically advanced than anyone else behind an invisibility cloak. Where does Wakanda get all its scientific and technological expertise? If students go abroad, doesn't anyone wonder why there are all these exchange students from a dirt-poor country, or what happens to them? And even if Wakanda can cloak itself now, how did it keep its first steam engines secret? And the finale involves a chaotic set-piece battle royale like in ""Civil War,"" again with nobody appearing even to get a skinned knee. Finally, I think they missed an opportunity by killing off Killmonger. In his final scene, he looked like he might be open to redemption. They could have done a lot with him as a flawed but slowly maturing hero."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"I can consider myself as a big fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. In my opinion the phase 1 was boring, the phase 2 was fine and the phase 3 is being amazing.
I didn't know nothing about Black Panther before to watch it, but this movie is the proof of how great a PG-13 super hero film can be. The main story is really good, has small twists to keep the interest and memorable characters to make every single scene epic.Some of the most points I love are: the costumes & the characters design (the creators deserve a nomination for the next Oscars), the action sequences are all incredible (the scene in South Korea is one of the best I've seen in a action film), and the soundtrack is amazing.Rating: 8.5/10I know it's an important masterpiece for the African people and I'm happy to see how Marvel could handle it with success. Now I hope they do movies with more people from different races, female leaders, and also with gay, bisexual and lesbian super heroes.
By the way, don't expect anything awesome for the credits scenes, they're just okay."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman & Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.
Well, I certainly enjoyed this entry in the MCU. Would probably get it when it's out on home video, or available for streaming off Amazon."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"Despite a very good performance from Michael Jordan, who was a very strong ""bad guy"", the movie was very non superheroish. I did like Danai as the general too, she definately was the part.They tried rather unsuccessfully to be humerous, there was the occasional attemp at lafter from the crowd, but very quietly.If the movie had not been a marvel superhero movie, despite its somewhat ""Lion king"" like storyline, it would have been a good story.But, its a marvel superhero movie, so wheres the superhero stuff ?I also thought it was a little on the violent side for younger kids, several people were shot dead in cold blood, another had their throat cut (though you dont see the knife slitting or blood, its obvious what has happened).It is also 2 1/4 hours long, and it feels like it."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2019,7/10,This was a generic marvel movie. Terrible cgi. Characters could have been developed better. The plot and conclusion could be seen from the start. But overall a decent movie. Nothing to go crazy over. A fun time.
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2020,1/10,Nothing special about this film. Might as well be watching Captain America. Really overhyped. I can't believe people actually say this movie should have won Oscars LMFAO.
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2019,3/10,"There are far too many reviews that rather agonizingly run too long - So let this one be brief but very on point: This movie is contrived, derivative and formulaic, period. It reaches nothing higher than hyped banality in striving for political and racial correctness. Trying to balance the scales of racial injustice is vainly attempted here via Marvel Comic Hollyweird. That it should have been nominated for an Academy Best Picture award speaks to the brainless community of those living in the entertainment bubble of vapid pretense in our current times."
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2019,8/10,"The stories about superheroes who take part of a royal family are interesting, to see how the main characters would balance their responsibilities, between being a superhero around the world and being a king in the kingdom where they are from. The main characters would take important decisions for the good of the kingdom and its people, by making sure to not commit the same mistakes of the past that brought heavy consequences. Some of these stories would end with the sacrifice of the main characters, who leave to the people an important message to move forward with the kingdom. Other stories would end with the main characters surviving from a dangerous mission, who will then conclude with what they started. There was an interest to release in the MCU a solo movie about the character Black Panther, to see how he would move forward after the event of Captain America: Civil War. Until the young filmmaker Ryan Coogler came to release the movie about Black Panther, as he decided to make the movie differently than the previous MCU movies. In 2018 came out Black Panther by Ryan Coogler with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. The movie's plot: The new king T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda, to assume the throne after the death of his father. In this hidden kingdom filled with incredible technologies, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) comes to Wakanda with a reason to challenge T'Challa. There was a great risk to make Black Panther, as usually innovative movies became box office failure to be then appreciated years later as important cult. Instead Black Panther surprised the audience and the critics, to become a successful movie with more than $1.347 billion box office. Usually the superhero movies explore in the easiest way the theme good and evil, which is going to be already expected how the story would end. Instead Black Panther explored the theme good and evil in the complex way, to see how some decisions bring heavy consequences which makes the movie intriguing and original. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear how the story would be told, from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm of the story. The movie does not use any kind of clich√©s to be predictable, but it surprises with unexpected plot twists to be unpredictable. The production designer Hannah Beachler elaborated the settings of Wakanda in a particular way, as she took inspirations from the original Black Panther comic book's settings and also from some of Africa's settings to make the movie creative and visceral for the audience. The lightings, the colors and the camera make some of the most emotional scenes, atmospheric where the audience would get surprised. Some of the most spectacular moments of the movie look like atmospheric paintings, which make these epic scenes unforgettable and emotional in every shot angles. The costume designer Ruth E. Carter elaborated the costumes in a particular way, which make these costumes stylish also thanks to the colors and their forms. It is also interesting to see how some of the tribal costumes, are technologically advanced which make them creative. The score by Ludwig G√∂ransson was creatively elaborated, as it uses orchestral instruments mixed with traditional African instruments. The musician Baaba Maal collaborated with Ludwig G√∂ransson to make the score powerful, especially on the unforgettable tracks which he sang for the most epic scenes. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent performance as T'Challa who has to take an important decision, if Wakanda has to be kept as a secret kingdom or if it has to be revealed. It is an interesting part of the movie, to see what kind of difficult responsibility T'Challa has to take for Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan was really good as Erik Killmonger, who is one of the best villains of MCU. He is a character who has so much anger inside of his soul by searching the justice, in the most violent way for vengeance which can be understood the reason of his anger. Lupita Nyong'o did a well done performance as Nakia who is a strong character, she would do anything to help T'Challa whenever he needs. Danai Gurira did a well done performance as Okoye who is a proud Wakandan and T'Challa's bodyguard, she remains loyal to the Royal's throne no matter if some kings are good men or not. Finally Letitia Wright was excellent as Shuri who is T'Challa's younger sister, she creates incredible technologies to be even smarter than Tony Stark. The special effects were specifically elaborated by making the action scenes, spectacular and visceral in every single details to be breathtaking. Black Panther is one of the best and most creative superhero movies of all time."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"The most anticipated MARVEL film since 'The Avengers' (2012), does the hype surrounding 'Black Panther' pay off in terms of it being an exceptional film, or does it falter under the weight of expectations?1. There will be major spoilers scattered throughout my review so this is your last chance to stop reading if you have yet to see the film. The movie picks up a week after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' as Prince T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda and ascends to the throne as King. The plot on the surface is fine and delivers as expected, but the events that follow isn't anything new. Not saying that's a bad thing, but there was nothing that happened I wasn't surprised about. The more interesting subplot revolves around a past event in which King T'Chaka (John Kani) murders his younger brother N'Jabu (Sterling K. Brown) for trading Wakandan arms to various countries. It turns out N'Jabu had a son (Erik Killmonger) that grew up to seek revenge against the country that abandoned he and his father.2. As much class and style he possessed for his brief stint in 'Civil War', Chadwick Boseman is not interesting at all as T'Challa/Black Panther. Not saying he's a bad actor, but he plays the character with such drawl and lack of charisma. He does not ""own the role"" as they say, so it's hard for me to buy into it. Michael B. Jordan was by far the most interesting and sympathetic character by far. He brings much needed life into an already dull film. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger but unfortunately he has very little screen-time. After the sequence at the museum in the beginning, Jordan does not show up in the film until 40-45mins later. Killmonger is such a compelling character that by the time he finally pops up again, they rush through his story to where he feels under developed. I would wholeheartedly agree that he could have been the best villain of the MCU to date had the script-writers only incorporated him more into the story. 3. Andy Serkis was an interesting villain as Ulysses Klaue when he first appeared in 'Age of Ultron', but he's murdered by Killmonger halfway through so there obviously won't be any more development for him to say the least. Despite that, Serkis does make his presence known during the casino and chase sequence in South Korea. As far as action. there were only two sequences that I did enjoy, one being Black Panther chasing Klaue through the streets of Korea and Killmonger kicking the crap out of T'Challa to claim the throne as the new King. There honestly wasn't any other set-pieces I enjoyed or found mildly exciting. The final brawl between T'Challa and Killmonger on the subway track was awful. The CGI was weak and the overall fight was boring without any sheer tension or stakes.4. Apart from Angela Basset and Forest Whitaker, the rest of the supporting cast is either annoying or flat, and the same goes for the humor in the film. If it was up to me, the script would have gotten an overhaul or placed in the hands of actual writers to modify or (better yet) rewrite the whole damn thing. Despite the camera occasionally doing unnecessary close-ups on the fights, the cinematography on the African plains were amazing. The design on Wakanda and the sets blew me away, however, we don't spend a lot of time on the environments to say I felt captivated by it. Maybe 'Infinity War' might do justice for this character once more, but as for now, the Black Panther himself is a weak and undeserving (so-called) hero. Imagine Thor lost his home of Asgard, lost most of his people and even lost an eye all in his last movie, and I truly believe he'd make a better King than T'Challa and actually have the balls to rule Wakanda.'Black Panther' will undoubtedly sky-rocket at the box-office from all the undeserving false hype. Sure, kids will love it but there's no reason critics to honestly give such a mediocre film glowing reviews. Seeing it for what it, this movie is no better and probably lesser than some of the MCU film before it."
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,7/10,"It was entertaining but not one of Marvels best by a long shot. It was too long, terrible accents, mediocre CG for Marvel. I enjoyed it as a descent one time see, but could go without ever watching it again. I have a feeling it only gained such popularity because of its wthnic diversity which shouldnt be a deciding factor for a good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2019,9/10,"I think Black panther is the best movie I have ever seen. It is action, adventure and science fiction movies. Tchalla tells the story of in goes to fight his rival with the king of Wakanda. Tchalla goes to help the Wakanda. The problem is an evil goes to destroy the Wakanda. In my opinion the movie is the best Marvel. The costume are amazing and fantastic. The special effects are incredible. The score by Baoba Macl is absolutely amazing it is the best music ever. The costume is transformable and it a change of colors. The movies is the best because is amazing , fantastic you should watch the best Marvel movies"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2020,10/10,"Finally watched this film after hearing everyone saying ""IT WAS AWESOME"" or ""WAKANDA FOREVER"". Boseman and Jordan both did awesome in their part. The fight was the best one of all! I can see why this movie had AWESOME reviews!Edit: Some might say this is not the ""best"" Avenger movie, or possibly a disappointment, but honestly, it isn't. The actor was perfect for his role, and the movie was still successful. RIP Chadwick! Best actor and Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"****Spoiler Alert ***** DO NOT read if you don't want to know the story line! Black Panther had loads of potential, mainly due to the fact that the Super hero was not from America. I'm not saying that I don't like Super heroes from America, I do and I love them, however, the with BP film makers had a different back story to work with and had a real opportunity to produce something really creative and really different within the Marvel Universe; but did they? .....No!The story writers kept the film within a safe and regularly used story line frame work. Here's the frame work:
1. The parent (mother or Father) keeps some dark secret from the the son/daughter.
2. The parents(s) wanted to tell their off spring but never did, due to either dying or being killed earlier than they anticipated.
3. Throw in some dangerous element or threat or villain.... in this case the metal Vibranium which some bad guys are after and fill a portion of the film with chase scenes and explosions.
4. Then go back to the dark secret... in this case the father killed the brother and left the brothers son in American
5. The brothers son grows up vowing to take his bitter revenge.
5. The bitter revenge is then taken by the son and tries to kill our hero in this case its BP. Everyone thinks hes dead ....but hes not!! (Surprise!!)
6. Our hero (BP) goes to a his life time enemies (in this case the Ape tribe in Wakanda) to asks them for help (the life time rivalry could be a rival gang or child friend who he/she fell out with due a fight over a girl or money... in this case its the Vibranium)
7. The life time enemies say No, No way will I ever help you!!....... But guess what they come to save the day, just in the nick of time....
8. They all live happily ever after!Hollywood on occasion put movies that breaks the above framework and other similar frameworks... but it is rare and Black Panther is most certainly not one of the exceptions and unfortunately, has its fundamental story line built solidly within the framework.Did I like the movie, Yes. Did I love the movie, ""almost"".... I love Marvel and DC (Ok ... I'm a sucker for the genre)My Point is this - Hollywood spends billions developing CGI and non CGI special effects ever year - it is high time that they start investing the same time and effort to create a rich and original story line that justifies the budget of the movie"
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,10/10,There will never ever be another Chadwick Boseman. We have lost a Legend /Icon who made a Huge difference in such a short time. Accomplished so much in such a short time. Gone too Soon. üïäüíúüé©üíúüïä an Angel Now.
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,10/10,"Created by Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in July of 1966, Black Panther was born in the Silver Age of Comic Book history becoming the first African American Marvel Superhero. With the creation of Black Panther, the black cat became a huge phenomenon in comic history that it made a feature film in 2018, with an unknown person playing the title roll by the name of Chadwick Boseman. 
 In the furriest of details, this movie has gained such momentum in the box office that it literally broke the box office within the first weekend. But let's get back to Wakanda. The birth place of the black prowler. We first met T'Challa, Black Panther, in Captain America: Civil War, when the Cap and Iron Man were on opposite sides of the government spectrum dueling for the survival of the Avengers. 
 Now we come to Wakanda and history of the way T'Challa became the prowler known as Black Panther. Now, I'm not going to sit here and spill out any details, but I will have to say that this movie has out beat all the other Marvel movies by far and to date. 
 I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, literally the shadows, that this movie will continue to go down in comic book history as the greatest superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all thanks to the director Ryan Coogler. As Kendrick Lamar swiftly puts it in the title track for the movie, ""This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you. This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer."""
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,5/10,"I think there's a decent movie buried in the gigantic pity party about how badly white people treat black people. And I'm not exaggerating about the scope of the pity party. Right from the start and repeatedly throughout whites are hammered for everything from slavery to the current state of affairs in Africa. I guess they single out white people since that is the only group that has shown a lot of guilt about it. Certainly blacks fared far far worse in non-white countries, but that doesnt sell tickets or gain political clout. It's odd they are so political in a movie that is otherwise a complete fairy tale centered around this all powerful, all benevolent black country that ironically most closely resembles the United States than anything else. Too bad, the pity party takes away from a good storyline and some amazing effects."
BLACK PANTHER,15 November 2018,1/10,"So apparently there's a hidden advanced civilization in Africa (lol) that has kept to itself all these years and refused to lift a finger to help fellow Africans from starvation and slavery.... Oh yeah, did I mention they are heros and have lived peacefully in a paradise ethnostate for hundreds of years?"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"It's understandable given the month it came out that it would get a little bit of an ""inflated score"" but ""Best Comic book movie ever"" is just being silly. This movie has things for the comic book fan and delivers action, the problem is though, it's just ok, doesn't make the character any more interesting then he ever was. Ant Man made a character who is historically not likeable into an interesting character. Black Panther remains an ""out of touch"" with real people superhero. Yeah there are others like that, but how many super heros are also rulers of a secret super advance nation. Iron had issues with his drinking, relationship problems, issues with his dad. Hulk had anger issues, fear of abandonment. Heck even thor had a heck of a lot of relatable family problems. This hero is a natural warrior destined to be king, his dad was already taken out in civil war so it begins with him taking over as king, he is bestowed super human strength and reflex and has a super advanced costume. Heck even Spider-Man homecoming Peter had relatable problems so its not about starting wearing the mantle. The plot being cookie cutter didn't help either, the villain being obvious villain up til the reveal of the less obvious main villain being still pretty obvious. In the end this movie doesn't really add anything necessary for the series or even interesting to the mcu. That said movie wasn't really awful... it just didn't deliver all the hype promised. If you must watch everything MCU, it's not going to be terrible, it won't likely be your favorite film though,"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,8/10,My wife and i just recently went to see the Black Panther movie.I liked it for what it was a very entertaining movie.Visually it was great very well made.It wasn't just a mindless action flick it was well paced and intelligent.The acting was top notch.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"Marvel always surprises me when I think they've run out of steam. Black Panther is what the 18th movie they've done? There seems to be no sign of them slowing down anytime soon, and for good reason. With the industry scrambling to find the next big cinematic universe/comic book franchise, there will never be another like what Marvel Studios has accomplished. We had Iron Man all the way back in 2008 and I never would've thought 10 years from then we'd be watching a Black Panther movie. I wasn't expecting much going into it, I figured it would be a decent action movie with a pretty familiar plot. In some ways it was, but in some ways it actually wasn't. These movies tend to fall under a pretty general third act with hero vs villain so I wasn't too thrilled by that part, but at least the action was well done so I let it slide. If anyone does anything like Fan4stick or Man of Steel ever again I'll walk out before it's even over. What Black Panther really shines in is it's world building through breaking the cultural barrier, I wondered going in how they were going to address the fact that Wakanda was this technological utopia when there are so many third world countries barely staying together. The answers they gave were satisfying at least for a comic book movie. You have a strong villain who's fueled with this hatred against the world for how they've treated African people and how Wakanda in has stood to the side all these years. Trying to not get involved of the obstacles African people are constantly struggling with all over the world. It's doing a lot right and I'm glad they took the time to tell a meaningful story that doesn't necessarily force a bridge into more movies, but rather contribute to the constant evolving world. By the end the characters make a decision that promises some interesting directions and possibilities and I'm genuinely curious to see where they could take it. Overall this movie was pretty satisfying. Great direction, performances, and plenty of popcorn action for a good time. If you enjoy these movies, obviously go see it, If you don't then I guess don't? I'm a bit surprised people are accusing positive reviews of being afraid to express their true opinions because they don't wanna come off as racist or offensive against SJW. But then again this is the internet so who am I kidding. We live in a day and age where people are looking to stand out online trying to look hip by saying the movie sucks because it's boring and what not. If you're going to critique something actually put some effort into it. Strip away the visuals and performances, then you got a pretty generic superhero story I agree, but what matters is the execution and effort they put into it. These movies are not Citizen Kane they're popcorn movies but they do a decent job that actually deserves the praise. There's a line T'chaka has in here about not building barriers but opening them and how we have to look after one another like we're a single tribe, humanity. The haters of Black Panther know I'm telling the truth and are going to downvote this review because they don't like people supporting Disney and their ""SJW agendas"". Well all I gotta say is you're not fooling anyone as long as you put money down for that ticket, I'll see you at Infinity War!"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,8/10,"Clocking in as the 18th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date, Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman might make some moviegoers wonder that in a series this widespread and ongoing, how could the magic still be there? I feel that the key to Marvel's success is in offering what you expect in a superhero movie: amazing visuals, great characters, thrilling action and storylines, but also something unexpected. Each of Marvel's huge successes takes the standard superhero story and merges it with another genre or style: Captain America was a World War 2 superhero film, its sequel was a spy/espionage-flavored hero flick, Spider-Man: Homecoming was a teen coming-of-age story with superheroics, Ant Man was a goofy heist comedy with heroics, Thor and Dr.Strange are fantasy mixed with the superhero mantle, etc. It gives each of the characters their own vibe, flavor, and niche they represent, and this even extends to the Netflix material. You never feel like you're watching more of the same even though the MCU and related material now spans hundreds of hours of content.  Black Panther carries on the this tradition by merging the superhero genre with a royalty-themed drama. Michael B. Jordan who plays the film's main villain, called it ""Marvel's Game of Thrones"" in an interview, and you can see why after watching. Black Panther also has themes of how to balance power on a worldwide scale, and how national superpowers can interact with other countries, if they should at all. 
If that all sounds like maybe it's not quite what you expected, or maybe a bit too political and not action packed enough, do a 180 and think again: Black Panther has all that great content packed up with absolutely beautiful visuals and kick ass action that bring the fictional nation of Wakanda to life.  Unlike something like Spider-Man or Daredevil, most of Black Panther's stories don't take place in anything close to modern American/first world life, so on top of introducing characters, crafting a story, and bringing it to a balanced and satisfying conclusion, the movie also had to introduce non-comic reading (the majority) audiences with what kind of nation Wakanda is, its history and culture, and what makes it so powerful. The movie manages to give you all this information on how Wakanda figures into the rest of the MCU and why we're only just now hearing about them in the story (although there were little hints at it earlier, aside from Age of Ultron, watch Iron Man 2 again!), and make that not just background information about the movie's setting, but an important part of the plot. T'Challa has to decide whether to keep Wakanda and it's technological marvels hidden from the rest of the world, or use his power and influence to help other countries in need, even if it risks invasion.  Marvel fans saw accomplished stage and film actor Chadwick Boseman play Prince T'Challa before in the excellent Civil War, so we already knew going in even from that performance that he'd deliver bigtime, and you get more of the same measured, wise, skilled, but occasionally fun-loving character we already saw. Helping him out is a great supporting cast including Danai Gurira (popular from The Walking Dead) as General Okoye, Forest Whitaker as royal advisor Zuri, a hilarious, smart mouthed and trolling-heavy performance from Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Golem performer Andy Serkis as the villainous arms dealer Klaw, and Michael B. Jordan as the villainous Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, amongst other great cast members that contribute to a story that brings the classic Black Panther stories written by Jack Kirby, Christopher Priest, and others to life. You could tell all of the cast and crew had passion for the project and wanted to deliver something memorable.  Speaking of the cast and story, it's the story of the villain, Killmonger, that really made this stand out for me. I was already excited and aboard the hype-train for sure, but was prepared for reality in case the movie let me down. Marvel has been criticized for its villains before, and how they don't measure up to other great film villains, but in several past installments, we've had villains with strong motivations, and between Vulture and Killmonger, we've seen some of this decade's best villains in comic book movies yet. Some critics are even going so far to say that Killmonger is on the level of Heath Ledger's Joker, and I have to say, his character nearly steals the movie with his well constructed backstory and well-developed motivations. Before he does something particularly heinous, you might even find yourself almost rooting for him after you find out why he's doing what he's doing.  The soundtrack to the film also has its own identity, with typical orchestral instruments being swapped out for African influenced instruments that were studied and recorded in their home environment by Ludwig Goranson, the composer. Royal trumpets and pounding drums accompany T'Challa when he starts laying down the might of the Panther on fools, a sharp female-led chant backs up General Okoye when she starts flinging her spear, and whenever Killmonger shows up, due to his American upbringing, you get a threatening, pounding orchestral hip-hop beat that is in my opinion good enough to be sampled by a major artist (speaking of major artists, Kendrick Lamar's original tracks he contributes to the soundtrack also help jazz up a few sequences and the end credits). 
 Along the same line, the costumes and design of Wakanda transport you to a world as rich as any fantasy movie, or any of the other incredible locations in the now wide Marvel Cinematic Universe.  With stunning visuals, fantastic action, and an ending that really makes you understand what T'Challa is about and what sets him and Wakanda apart from other superhero material, I think Black Panther is towards the top of MCU films. The one major criticism I can give it is going to be a spoiler, so please, if you haven't seen it yet, consider the review done, and go enjoy the movie. If not, scroll lower, and read my comments. The one change I would've made to Black Panther would be to save both of its main villains for future installments, much in the same way Loki from the Thor films has crossed over into other properties and hung around for a while now in the MCU, or how Wilson Fisk is still a factor in the Netflix shows. 
 Marvel has to acknowledge its good villain problem, and they did too good of a job crafting Killmonger, and to a lesser extent Klaw, who was still funny and interesting as well, to just kill them both off in their first outing. Killmonger uses Klaw's body as a token to enter Wakanda, but what if he faked his death and then revived Klaw, forcing Panther to fight them both in the end? That might've been interesting, and then have them both jailed to see justice for their crimes, so that they can be used in the series again. Both of them, but especially Killmonger, are such rich characters that it almost felt like a shame to cut them out of the franchise so soon. But that's how it goes, and as is, their deaths serve the story and are memorable."
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,10/10,"Marvel's Studios BLACK PANTHER roars to excitement that sets such a fantastic journey to what else T'Challa/Black Panther can bring to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Never without a doubt you would fall asleep during this movie. With so much fantastic action sequences, details on the plot, and what is to come. You are certainly not going to be falling asleep in the cinema. Chadwick Boseman brings a brand-new pack of pure-adrenaline that no other actor can beat his place as the King of Wakanda. His acting just brings more excitement and fantastic reviews to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which gives him a key to unlock upcoming movies to come with his exhilarating performance.BLACK PANTHER is a must-watch. Believe in the reviews, absolutely worth the watch, by far one of it's best that has been told.GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2019,7/10,extremely overhypedCGI blatantly looks and feels off for a good chunk of the filmthe story is literally the storyline of the lion kinghowever; it does intrigue me on what can be done with the character in the future
BLACK PANTHER,12 September 2018,10/10,Ignore all the rascist haters. This movie didn't make over a billion dollars because it stinks. Watch it and decide for yourself. I promise you won't be dissapointed.
BLACK PANTHER,25 August 2021,8/10,"The Story is meh, nothing spectecular and nothing bad, it's okay and a typical marvel story. But the style of this movie, the mix of technology and tradition, the setdesign, the costumes. All the visiuals are incredible and with ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" one of the best looking movies of the past few years. Definitly a 10/10 and overall a 8 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,5/10,"The music was great, the visual effects were spectacular, the acting was solid. But the story was ... almost a parody of itself. Weird. I sat there waiting for some event to align the various parts and make sense of characters' motivations. Instead, the movie just gracefully passed by and left me with nothing more than disappointment."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,3/10,"I waited until they hype died down before watching this movie, I could have waited another one or two ... YEARS! This is a typical Marvel's movie, they spent 15 minutes chasing the bad guy, and two hours fighting among themselves. It was boring in many places, but you keep watching hoping the next scene will be better, it wasn't. I can see why the Black movie goers flocked to theaters and dropped serious coin to see this trash. Before whoever is reading this get your drawers in a bunch I'm a Black movie goer and I really shouldn't have gone to see this.The movie made no damn sense, the only thing missing was the Pimps and Hookers and Drug Dealers. I gave it three stars cause it ended. You'd really have to be starved for black entertainment to watch this more than once, and once because you were duped into it.Just once MARVEL, I'd like to see you make a movie where the Heroes are fighting each other and out making a damn difference, every movie has the same concept, and quiet frankly it SUCKS! But whatever works right?I can only imagine The Avengers Infinity Wars with 40+ characters running around all vying for time, but that's another story. Foe me lets leave The Black Panther running around the jungles of Wakanda."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2019,6/10,"Notwithstanding the genre, which I enjoy generally, this story just never really grabbed me. In fact, it took a few sittings to watch to completion. The hook does come, but too late in my view.I thought some direction was overdone, in the sense that the director wants the audience to feel something, and is perhaps not sure it's been accomplished, so does a closeup on a character demonstrating that feeling. (Eg., I don't need a long close-up of someone saying ""weeee"" to know I should feel exhilarated, and it's off-putting.)Generally, the acting was good, but I must admit that I did not care for Andy Serkis in the villain role, which I thought was overacted, although I usually like him (particularly in the little gem, Einstein and Eddington). Again, a direction issue, not an actor issue.Overall, I just don't think the story itself was sufficiently well-told and directed to merit a higher rating. In my view, it was a real gift and way-off to be nominated for best movie. In my view, this movie is not even in the same story-telling ballpark as, eg, the wonderfully told story, Green Book."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"One of the few times I made time for an Opening Weekend movie and it was completely worth the lines. Great script, great acting and special effects. It will be a challenge bringing Panther into the rest of the Marvel World which is dominated by CAP & Iron Man but hopefully they will try. Watched this with family and everyone truly enjoyed all aspects. Great Job Marvel and director Ryan Coogler."
BLACK PANTHER,26 July 2018,7/10,"Well, here's a movie that's hated by a number of people as a result of it being overhyped. It was fairly entertaining and decent. Just that it wasn't worth all the hype. The only thing it has to be a unique MCU film would be that it had was the majority of people from black community as its cast members. I am not criticizing that, but that's NOT a legit reason to hype it up so much.Good.
It was whatever the first Thor movie couldn't be. In other words, it was ""Thor"" (2011) on Wakanda and better. It has some fantasy elements regarding the ""Black Panther formula"" and at the same time, it is quite of a sci fi too, and on the sideline it's also a crime film. These themes hold together very cohesively and make the movie a solid piece of art, on the whole. For the first time in an MCU movie, a villain was good. Killmonger is probably my second favorite MCU villain till date, the first one being Thanos. That character was well written to say the least. We knew where he was coming from, his motives, what he is up to and why. He is the best part of this movie. Many of the heist and crime film vibes it had was very interesting in the scenario they set up for this movie. The character interactions and the dynamic between various characters were good. Some funny scenes and dialogues land properly (while some don't, it's an MCU movie, after all). While watching this film, you won't want to skip any part of it, even though, in the end, you might be saying, ""is that it?! Dafuq?!!"" But most importantly, it gives you a really good introduction to Black Panther. We can get behind this hero for good. The character arc they give to him is excellent.Mixed.
A lot of it feels like parts of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The ""sci fi"" part feels quite like the stuff going on between Batman and Fox. The establishment of the character of Killmonger was (in an undertone) similar to how we got introduced to The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" or to Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Also, some scenes are quite similar to interrogation scenes of ""The Dark Knight"". I am not saying that it was a ripoff of Nolan's films. It might be the same in the source material they adapted, I don't know. But noticing those themes being dealt in a similar way, makes it kind of a mixed bag. The movie, also, apparently ""kills"" off a character, which doesn't feel so compelling because they were to be back in future films (which had already been announced or were seen in the trailer of Infinity War). Not saying that the way they killed off the character was bad. If we didn't know about him being back in Infinity War, it would've made a solid impact. But, we know about him being back. So, it wasn't much interesting.Bad.
Many fights and scenes in the film are super clich√©d. Not only that you can predict what will happen, you can even predict what kind of a dialogue will close that scene, and what will be the immediate consequence for the character who gave that piece of dialogue. The third act of the movie was just plain generic third act of a superhero movie with a lot of clich√©s and dumbed down ""Captain America: Civil War"" conditions with some of kind of ""Lord of the Rings"" vibe.Conclusion.
""Black Panther"", for me, was some kind of a mixed bag. It was surely overhyped, but wasn't so bad of an overhyped movie. On the whole, a solid entertainer. Not something like Infinity War or Iron Man or Avengers or Civil War that will be talked for a long time.Rating.
Score : 7.3/10
Grade : B+"
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2019,9/10,"After months, i finally see a movie on the big screen. Maybe my first in 2018.Black Panther my favourite superhero on the big screen. Feels fantastic. The storyline is simple. Might be the most simplest Marvel story ever made. The energy of every character is truly beyond words. The tech, graphics, sound effects, ooo - I love the background songs / music. Many must have thought, who this 'Black Panther' is and where did he come from while watching Captain America: Civil War (2016 film). Now, this is your chance to understand the Wakandan's.Peace Out!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,4/10,"Well it was alright, kinda disappointed as the hype of the film sounded good. But yeah it was okay. Theres only two things I didnt like which were they were heavy on the CGI and the line ""What are those"" was just stupid!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2020,6/10,"The only impression I left on the movie was ""Wakanda forever"". Haha."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,5/10,"Ou take one paragraph story of Thor Ragnarok, you change a few details here and there, some dressing down on complexity and comic relief, oh yeah... don't forget to add a different Super Hero and you have got yourself a money churner!Can't say it was a visual treat, can't say it was a well cooked plot, can't say acting was powerful enough to be memorable, can't say it was worth the money!Black Panther, the same old story, the same old treatment, extremely predictable, yet I see it's enviable box office collections and wonder, what was so wrong with Justice League?"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,1/10,"Green Lantern has been saved from being the worst super hero movie of all times, replaced by Black Panther.As someone who has grown up in Africa, the accents are beyond ridiculous. The actions is sparse and the acting cringeworthy. The story drags along and the pacing is off.This is no super hero movie, it is a political drama and a poor one at that."
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2018,5/10,"Marvel's ""Black Panther"" treads new grounds as it takes on racial and political problems, as well as being a blockbuster action film. ""Black Panther"" works as a positive medium for building bridges; it has a good message, but is not a good movie. Once you look past the political and social ambitions the film aims for, it's just another by-the-numbers predictably average comic book movie. The only real impressive thing about the movie is its villain. Michael B. Jordan was forced to carry the movie, and when he wasn't on screen it was painfully boring (most of the first hour). His villainous Erik Killmonger stands as one of the better MCU villains. His ferocious yet sympathetic portrayal of a vengeful man gave the movie the spark it needed to avoid sucking. Also his super fit body jacked the eye candy way up (for a second I thought I was gay). However, Killmonger suffers from abrupt Dr. Evil syndrome. His prime motivation is to give all black people around the world specialized weapons made from vibranium, a mined substance in the technologically advanced Wakanda, to seize social dominance over any non-black person. I'm surprised he did not ask for laser beams attached to the heads of sharks. I'm sure the vibranium is capable of such matters. Without the emergence of Michael B. Jordan's more interesting villain, ""Black Panther"" is a dreadfully formulaic, predictable and borderline boring superhero movie. The characters, outside Killmonger, are pretty forgettable and uninteresting. The comic relief is very inconsistent; a few jokes hit while most completely miss the mark. The CGI is noticeably sub-par. The action sequences are not poorly done but don't leave a lasting impression. Many of the film's plot points you can see coming from a mile away (T'Challa vs. Killmonger part I and II, M'Baku's entrance, T'Challa's return). ""Black Panther"" is a movie that is getting such spectacular reviews from critics because it has a socially proactive message, touches upon real world issues, and nearly has an unprecedented all black cast in a superhero movie. Judging it as a piece of entertainment, it is wickedly underwhelming, predictable and disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2021,1/10,One of the worst ive seen lol. Please believe me youl waste your time unless your a silly blm activist.
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2019,5/10,"The Good: The story was good, the visuals were good, the world building was cool. The supporting cast was great, Especially Jordan.The Bad: It's boring, there are so few action scenes, this one feels so slow. Boseman's performance was weak, in one scene he is joking with his sister, his delivery of jokes was just terrible. There are some really cliched moments.
Overall Black Panther is cool mostly for it's world, but it is really overrated, it's definitely not the best film in the MCU"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2021,,"As part of the MCU world I hate that Wakanda is a perfect black utopia, but Asgard, the white equivalent by all rights, has a black Nordic god (Heimdall) and a black Valkyrie in Brynhildr. It just rubs me the wrong way. Imagine if the Forrest Whitaker role was played by a white guy!Apart from that, cool graphics. That's about it. A big giant eye roll."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"I was actually hoping to see a story of how T'Challa from his childhood could became the Black Panther. But it was not the case. And this was not a conventional Marvel movies either as usually origin story was made first before the superhero appeared in other movies. Regardless though, the story was made a bit short and went straight to the time when T'Challa would be made king. Plus the how he came to know Everett Ross was not shown which made me felt the movie was not too complete as an origin story. Other than those minor shortcomings that I personally felt, the movie definitely had some good moments. The action sequence in Korea plus the climax scene was awesome. The special effects (apart from few brief ""a bit obvious"" computerized scenes of Wakanda in the background during the time T'Challa was going to be crowned king) were very good. And there were also a bit of funny moments which involved Shuri plus surprisingly from M'Baku (Winston Duke).I would really advise you to be fully concentrated from the start to understand better on the earlier parts. To my personal opinion, the movie developed to be more interesting when the villains began to appear and the fights started.I get the appeal of this movie to critics due to its rather complex character development of T'Challa plus the appearance/representation of the African people in a world where third world country were still looked down. I myself as a simple minded movie audience preferred a more intense superhero movie, which I thought I did not really get in here. Therefore, even if the movie was hailed as one of the best in Marvel Cinematic Universe, I personally did not feel that. It may be good, but certainly not the best. Again this does not mean the movie was bad at all, even my wife was able to truly enjoy it. But as I felt it was not the best superhero origin movie & the fact that the action sequence were not too much, I still prefer other such MCU movies like the first Iron Man, Ant-Man or Captain America. Oh another thing, there was not a lot of surprises here, even 1 or 2 supposed surprising moments could have been guessed by my wife and I. As usual, there would be end credit scene which was having 2 of them in this movie. So wait till the very end to make sure you see them. In conclusion, my personal view is that this movie was probably a little bit over-hyped."
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,2/10,"Apart for the current MCU fever and the political climate, I don't get why this movie gets this much praise.
With lackluster CGI, a lot of continuity errors and character inconsistencies, this movie wouldn't stand out in any other decade. 
There are better movies that touch on the african culture (Tsotsi, Hotel Rwanda), better action movies (most MCU movies, the recent Mission Impossible ones) and more compelling portrayals of heroism that touch on the minority aspect of society (Boyz n the Hood, Dope) that don't require fantasy elements.
The villain was better than in most previous MCU movies, but the writers still didn't give him anything with gravitas, for T'Challa to rise to the challenge in a memorable way.
If we weren't living in a society that imposes race as a stand-alone quality of a person, this movie would've been forgotten in a couple of weeks."
BLACK PANTHER,18 June 2021,10/10,"This story was so new and innovative that I could really believe it as if it's happening in a parallel world, that's a real art of story creating and that's why I'm sure it deserves to be in my art of cinema list."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2021,5/10,My god for a movie made in 2018 it sure as hell looked like those fight scenes where made in 2001. That was just really awful. They didn't use real people to make those fight scenes and it showed. The acting was great but with the movies selling point being the action. The horrible fight scenes really took away from it.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Ryan Coogler uses the template of Black Panther being this African superhero leading a secret futuristic nation to bring something new, fun and important to not just watch but also listen to. While it is not new that superhero movies like the X-men films, The Dark Knight and more recently with Winter Soldier and Civil War have used the genre to comment on politics, Coogler goes straight into the subject matter of an issue that is more relevant then ever. From the imaginary of Africans being forced onto slave ships in the opening cinematic, Coogler is not sugar-coating the fact that Black Panther is addressing the sour history of white colonialism to the struggle of black communities in third-world nations and America today.On a visual and technical level it stands out from how many previous MCU films look and feel thanks to Coogler bringing his own cinematographer and composers he has collaborated with. Recently Oscar-nominated cinematography Rachel Morrison of Mudbound shoots very awe-moments that make Wakanda feel alive as a character. The music by Ludwig Gorisssons is also an improvement from the bland, predictable operatic score in past MCU films. The use of African chorus and instruments give Black Panther a lively feel with Gorissons using elements from Coogler's last movie Creed to give a sense of epic triumph. The action ranges from having the raw intensity in the Creed boxing matches to being kinetic and stylish, particular in the Korea scenes, like the Matrix. With the Vibranium technology Coogler finds a visual aesthetic to show Wakanda not looking too fantastical nor alien but more advanced then Tony Stark's tech while still retaining its African roots. Through that he brings of a vision of afrofuturism (a term I recently learned before this movie came out) to life where we see a culture of Africa that thrives as an advanced utopia without the influence of western whitewashing. But because some of Wakanda's ideals and beliefs may be questionable, it introduces fully fleshed-out characters that each bring a layer to Wakanda's culture. With old-fashioned traditionalist like T'Challa, Okoye, Zuri and M'Baku we see where there dedication to an ancient tradition of isolation and monarchy comes from but there views are clashed with those who think Wakanda could improve itself and the rest of the world from the country's own millennial generation in Shuri, the spy who has seen the outside world's problems in Nakia to the destructive revolutionist in Erik Kilmonger. 
Chadwick Boseman brings back his calm, cool charisma from Civil War but with a emotional conflict brewing inside him of how to approach his reign as king when new information is revealed about his heritage. Rather then sidelined as supporting roles, we see actresses like Lupita N'yongo, Danai Guirra and breakout Leticia Wright become co-leads of there own. Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri brings so much levity to what can be considered a serious political story but never feels like she is just a comic relief as she also acts as a younger but even smarter version of Tony Stark. And Danai Guirra also becomes a standout in showing some intense dramatic moments when her duty as the King's royal bodyguard is questioned. Winston Dukes as M'Baku, the tribal leader and rival of T'Challa is another surprise standout that shows a lot more depth and humour then I was expecting.And at long last Marvel brings a villain that surpasses Loki on a psychologically layered and threatening level in Erik Kilmonger. Rather then just Kilmonger acting as plot device to force T'Challa on the hero's path like past MCU villains have done, he is presented with an arc that echoes the hero's own journey. The difference however is his own actions become very destructive that are fuelled by a personal tragedy. From the injustice people of African descent have suffered to Wakanda turning its back on those that need it like so many first-world nations have done, Kilmonger makes T'Challa truly ask as both a hero and king what kind of responsibility does someone with great power truly have. Michael B. Jordan's charming personality makes his villain very likeable but also channels a rebellious attitude and rage that puts past villains to shame. Andy Serkis also get some really fun and compelling moments as returning villain Klaw who is shown as an example of why Wakanda fear outsiders they call ""colonizers"".The movie does have some problems though. While Martin Freeman gets more to do as Everett Ross then he did in Civil War, it does feel his role felt obligatory yet didn't feel like his character fit into the Wakanda storyline. The third act does fall into some of Marvel's usual final battle tropes with over-reliance on cg and the hero fighting an evil doppelg√§nger. But once the typical big battle ends, you see the hero and villain have a compelling conversation with who each other about their quest to accomplish the same goal.The best parts of this movie shine when Ryan Coogler as a director and co-writer takes control of the Marvel formula and uses it create an amazing and compelling standalone story that can leave with you with so much to talk about."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2021,4/10,"Black Panther was the very first black superhero in any main stream comic book to date appearing in 1966, obviously it was a big deal.As a white male, I absolutely love this character, the one from the comics I mean, and not the MCU version, mainly because of all the political agendas that are strewn through the picture, All I can say is enough is enough. Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,2/10,"This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."
BLACK PANTHER,7 January 2021,8/10,I watch this twice and I've always found a bit confusing and interesting. I'll try to watch it again and grasp it. The fact that Chadwick Bozeman was fighting cancer whilst filming this just shows what a great actor he is. He should really get an award and I really want to like this movie just because of what he did..
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,5/10,"Black Panther is a beautiful movie, but I was never IN it. I never felt like Wakanda was real. Who believes such an advanced nation would still not be a democracy ? Or that it was never discovered (even before they had the cloaking technology) ? I think my main concern though is T'Challa. I don't understand him, he's never developed enough. They think his introduction in Civil War is enough... And people seem to praise the villain. Well he has some legitimous concerns for sure, he's basically the audience asking itself ""if Wakanda is so advanced why is it not helping other black people around the world ?"". But he's too much of a show-off with his big muscles and everything. The character of Ross is also very poor. 0 development, he's weak, at no point his position in the CIA is actually earned. As a movie I understand that it's a milestone for some, just like Luke Cage was. But it is not a reason to overlook the issues plaguing this film. I think it would have been a much better movie if Black Panther was a scientific genius like in the comic, he even evented a science, ""shadow physics"". Here, they split his personality : the genius isn't him, it's his sister. If he were the scientific genius, his place on the Wakanda throne would be much more justified. As is, he's there just because he's the prince. There is a lot of unjustified stuff in the movie. Why is W'Kabi betraying T'Challa ? Why does M'Baku suddenly help ? Anyway, it was quite boring (because it's long as well) and Wakanda is beautiful but not that impressive, we just see one city. And I'm annoyed that Marvel movies always take place over the course of a couple of days. There's never any room for training, improvement, it's just action/reaction..."
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2018,3/10,"The hype surrounding this movie was incredible. I have never seen a movie so inflated before it even hit theaters. It was supposed to be some ground-breaking and awe-inspiring collection of actors in roles that were implied they were made for. A cast that perfectly fit the story line and would elevate this movie beyond mere Marvel offerings. What we got however, was a movie that wasn't even worthy of the source material.I've been a huge fan of Marvel and have read the comics since I was a boy. I am fairly familiar with T'Challa and the Black Panther character. Captain America and he worked together on many missions protecting Wakanda and the United States against evildoers. T'Challa has a great backstory to his character. I was really hoping that this movie would showcase some of that so that we could appreciate the uniqueness in the Black Panther character. Sadly it did not. I wanted to see some of the hardships he faced as king. The warring between the tribes and how he manages to balance being a king and being the Black Panther. Instead we got a CGI heavy movie that lacked any sort of heart or fondness for it's own protagonist. The CGI wasn't good either. I expected more from a Marvel movie.One of the reasons why a good hero is so important is that you have to have a good bad guy to go along with it. This movie did not. Killmonger's character was deluded down to an angry punk kid who just wanted to look cool and have power. The scenes with T'Challa and Killmonger would have been so much more meaningful had they taken advantage of the relationship they had together more. I felt no connection to the Killmonger character. They could have spent more time showing the conflict within T'Challa having to fight his own family just to stay alive. With the backstory of Killmonger, we should have felt a lot more sympathy towards him but the foundation just wasn't there. More time should have been spent on the conflict between the family and less time on CGI and bragging about the technology they had. Such a disappointment."
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2020,2/10,What an absolute turkey. Kept wanting to turn it off. Dire acting and way too much BAD CGI
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Many reviews here are stating this and that about Black panther and digging deep, while on the surface Black Panther is as good as any good superhero movie. The cinematography is brilliant, followed by a strong sense of commitment by the actors to their characters, backed up by amazing visual effects and visuals.It is a typical marvel movie,that sets off on a high note and followed by a strong second half. Micheal B Jordan produced yet another charismatic performance as killmonger. Chadwick Bosnan's performance was stiff throughout. Most of his jokes were just cringey and his dialogue delivery was just awful. The plus points to this film include the extra bit of effort put by the costume designers to make everything authentic as hell. Any one would be completely mesmerized by the visuals Black panther has brought on screen, making it one of the best looking Marvel movies to date. Killmonger was yet again a sensible villain. We feel that he has the reason to get his throne and this in turn pushes T'Challa to see into himself and undo the wrong. Black Panther works as a good superhero flick, but marketing it as a movement is just plain absurdity. The film so blatantly imposes that without vibranium, Wakanda and its sprawling civilization would be nothing and would cease to exist. It also has a predictable story and a kind of a forgettable ending. Killmonger deserved more screentime, in comparison to T'Challa. If you're looking for some insane action or some adrenaline rush, Black panther is not for you. It slowly works itself, with some noticeable flaws and mistakes."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is hands down, one of the best superheroes spin-off movies of all time! It delivers a witty, action-packed epic moments and brings a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.It tells the story of T'Challa who, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.Okay, even if you are not a fan of superhero movies... you may find the issues explored thought-provoking. It is well acted, dazzlingly shot by an expert cinematographer Rachel Morrison and full of humour. Black Panther is an untold story in modern cinema; a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.This movie has a fast beating heart because it ain't just sincere for good sake but it is a heartfelt epic that doesn't fall flat. It's the kind of art that's star-strikingly theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel forced.The score is authentic, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.In the context of values, Black Panther serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.In a nutshell, this is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves many many marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people."
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2021,8/10,"Black Panther (2018) is a beautiful movie. They got the sound & visuals right, mad respect for that, I enjoy the fact that everything that is happening in the movie has a meaning behind it and everything makes sense. The movie debates important themes and it also has a powerful emotional message alongside a intriguing dilemma.Now let's get to the parts I did not like : I feel like Black Panther's suit is too strong, making him close to invincible so I just know : if he puts that suit on he is god-like nothing can touch him. Compared to Black Panther, Iron Man is the superior hero movie since every time he puts that suit on there are actually stakes evolved, he is not invincible, usually his suit gets teared apart by the end of the fight.A quick fix to this problem was to integrate a weapon powerful enough to penetrate Black Panther's suit unfortunately the movie does not include this.Also I feel like the time could have been managed in a better way : the movie is 2 hours long but at the end of it I felt drained due to the unnecessary repetitive scenes such as the rituals. They should have made the elixir to just temporarily remove the powers. That could have saved a lot of time. With this extra time they could invest it into Zuri's death which felt overly rushed and abrupt or maybe into the only tribe that challenged Black Panther's in the beginning. The movie established that tribe as someone that shouldn't be there but I don't understand why since they spent too less time talking about them thus when you see them after they find Black Panther they look like some normal cool guys so you are just left wondering what's wrong with this particular tribe."
BLACK PANTHER,19 September 2021,10/10,"I love all the scenes in this movie, Wakanda, the people, the rarest natural resources that made the shield for captain America. It's sad to see our panther couldn't continue."
BLACK PANTHER,26 June 2018,10/10,This movie was a blockbuster. Only haters are rating it poorly after it made $1 billion dollars. Its easy to shame a popular black movie months later. I really wish ratings could be turned off aftera month.
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,6/10,"This is a film that is a good addition to the MCU, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. This results in the film being quite predictable and bland at times, whilst still remaining enjoyable. The acting is all very assured, particularly from Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira and Martin Freeman. However, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is the real star of the show. He is a very compelling villain whose motivations you can understand due to being removed from a culture he should have been allowed to grow up in. Also as he has effectively been set on his path by T'Challa's father killing his father, it creates something that is very Shakespearian.The theme of ancestry is something I felt was explored very well with how T'Challa realises he can make changes from the decisions of rulers of the past. This then results in Wakanda providing aid to other countries and not isolating itself from the rest of the world, which feels like a very timely message. The melding of traditional African culture with advanced technology was also engaging and visually satisfying.There are some issues though such as some CGI looked quite fake, some dialogue being clunky, the humour mostly falling flat (The 'What are those' joke was particularly cringeworthy) and Killmonger should have been involved in the narrative a lot more. Overall it's a mostly satisfying superhero film."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,6/10,"By difining word of ""technologically advanced African nation""
i dont expect an other newyork city.
bunch of bulidings , and railways .
i think its tomuchthats why i give 6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 October 2021,4/10,"If you look at the story line, it's very plain and simple story and offers nothing new. Positive review are very much politically motivated and comes from specific community. It's merely a one time watch movie but Chadwick is the star of the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2021,7/10,"This is a good spin on a predictable genre. Other reviewers say that it's the same kind of superficiality masked by a black cast, but I disagree. I think this deals with a more complex subject like Pan-Africanism in an interesting setting. The soundtrack and costumes were both very enriching. Klaue seems to be a key villain early on, but this quickly shifts as Killmonger becomes the main threat. This complicates the surface level conflict of Wakanda vs. the outer world, as Killmonger has Wakandan roots. Anyone claiming that Killmonger was superficial is clearly biased, considering he's up against incredibly bland characters in other Marvel films like Thanos, Ultron, and Loki. I saw this in Oakland and it is probably my favorite movie-in-theaters experiences ever."
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,2/10,"I went into the movie a bit apprehensive because I saw the high scores from critics and initial viewers, then noticed lower user reviews coming in. For the life of me, I could not understand how anyone watching this film would rate it above a 6 or 7. The special effects were average but considering it was a Marvel film, it was downright awful. The fight scenes were edited into hundreds of 1-3 second clips and there was no sense of battle choreography like the other Marvel films. There was also no time spent on character building. The people of Wakanda are the stiffest and most deadpan I have ever seen. Zero emotion and normal conversations are like speeches instead of banter. Marvel hit it big in its later movies introducing humor but this film has none at all. Probably the most surprising that the media didn't warn anyone was that the ""Bad Guy"" felt the black population had been oppressed, so to make things right, he wanted to basically wipe out the white population in a genocide. This surprised and kind of insulted me - I've never oppressed anyone yet I am the target? Then Black Panther and his army tries to stop him more to protect Wakanda's secrecy than to stop a raving lunatic. Saw this film with a friend and when the lights came up, our conversation was like this - my friend asked me what I thought and I said ""MEH. You?"" He just frowned and said ""Disappointed."""
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,9/10,"For every glowing milestone of excellence, for every new step towards a brighter, more peaceful future, there will be a jerk deliberately trying to ruin it, desperately attempting to keep a grip on the world that he knows: hateful, angry, belligerent--and completely beyond his grasp of understanding.I saw BLACK PANTHER, expecting to see another superhero movie, only with a black man as the hero. I expected to see comic book canon that I would not understand, as I have never read a comic book with the Black Panther in it, nor even heard that such a character existed before I went to see the movie. I expected to see the tragic good man, suffer at first, only to gradually rise to the top, and become the hero that he was meant to be, as a shining example for all to look up to.That kind of happened. Then again, that kind of didn't.The trick, as I've come to understand it, is that the movie is not what we think it is. What we think, is that it's a superhero movie. But like THE DARK KNIGHT, there's more to it than that. To simply call it a superhero movie, to me, feels like an injustice, only because the label seems to minimize its impact, and its importance.THE DARK KNIGHT is less about comic book heroes and villains coming to life, and more about philosophy, criminality, society as a whole. The Joker doesn't just kill people, and he doesn't just terrorize-he shakes Gotham City to its core, and forces everyone involved in its keeping to take hard, long looks at themselves, making them realize that good and bad are not crystal clear subjects, no matter who you are and what you are doing.This film does something similar... it brings up subjects referring to racism and society not just in terms of America, but in terms of humanity as a whole. Should Wakanda broaden its horizons? Or should it remain a pure beacon of hope, as it is brilliantly portrayed, and keep its light from being threatened by the rest of the world and its hatred and greed? Should it share its technology with others, or be fearful of the lunatics that will use it to cause more terror and destruction?Not easy questions to answer, and so the meat of the story is there, hiding behind the brilliant action sequences and humor. It's not easy to see which answer is best, and it is made worse by the arrival of the real villain, and his ties to Wakanda.Wihout spoiling anything, I'll simply leave my commentary on what I think BLACK PANTHER is, and why it is so special. BLACK PANTHER is not a superhero movie at all, from my point of view. It is a hero movie, where those that try to do what is best for the land they love struggle against odds to do what they can, with no clear answer as to who is right or wrong, or why. The Black Panther is the leader, the King, but he is not the only hero, and does not outshine those that love and support him. He is surrounded by heroes, of various kinds and creeds, and each shows their honor and nobility in different ways throughout the film.I was thoroughly impressed with BLACK PANTHER, and look forward to seeing it again. If I had a recommendation for anyone wanting to know if they should go and see this film, it is this: Leave your expectations at the door, try to keep and open mind, and above all else... remember that this is fiction, friends. Above all else, it is not real.Which is a shame. Because I for one wish that Wakanda was real, and that people like this really existed."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"The Black Panther setting made me think of Avatar on many occasions. The whole tribal vibe is alike. Vibranium is basically Unobtanium; and both Wakanda and Pandora are pretty much the typical isolated ""hidden elf village"". The difference is that Wakanda has lots of tech whereas Pandora is less tech-advanced, but for all that it matters to the story Wakandan secret tech power might as well be Pandora's mystical Eywa power.As for the plot, the Black Panther Shakespearean drama reminded me a lot of Disney's Lion King. Basically it's a 'What if Mufasa killed Scar, then after he dies and Simba becomes king, Kovu decides to walk in Scar's footsteps?' plot.It's all not exactly original, but good popcorn entertainment for a Friday night out when you want to dial down your brain for a moment. Visuals are stunning, characters are engaging to watch, and while I would've enjoyed a bit more comedy I still enjoyed what was delivered.A few small annoyances did continue to niggle at the back of my mind:1a) No country, empire, community, etc. has ever been technologically super-duper advanced and rich while at the same time pursuing an isolationist policy. Just check world history, everywhere isolationism happens, it sends people back into the Dark Ages or (even worse) the Stone Age! So, unless the Wakandans were snubbing their fellow primitive humans in favor of open trade borders with Asgardians, Kree, and other Marvel aliens, a technologically advanced but isolated Wakanda is a complete socio-economic impossibility.
1b) Related to the above, technologically advanced countries never rely on a single person for all their tech. Shuri is great, where are the other Wakandan geniuses?2) Why was only the king allowed the super herb? If Wakanda industrialized the cultivation of that herb, they could've created an entire army of super soldiers to protect their borders; no need to pretend to be a third world country. Furthermore, that herb could boost human productivity like super-coffee, increasing Wakanda's economic output by miles an turning them into a superpower greater than the USA and China combined! Where is my Wakandan hegemony??3) Wakanda is a highly advanced society that chooses its leader with a good old fist fight. Really?I get it, it's a comic book movie, so there isn't anything inherently deep or realistic about it, nevermind realpolitik. Still, call me a nitpicker, but for some reason these 3 points continued to annoy me throughout the movie, not that it wasn't entertaining."
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2018,6/10,"I went to see this at the theater which doesn't happen a lot for me. Thrilled that Michael and Andy were going to be in it. Even though their performances are overall good, this movie is very unbalanced. A few scenes being borderline total cringe for the sake of a joke. The ps2 cgi fight at the end didn't help either.I don't know why marvel constantly takes the same character and costume for the hero and copy paste it on the villain and make him evil. Lack of ideas? Color grading has been forever awful since I watched that marvel review on YouTube and can say it was a real disappointment. Even if there's alot of fiction and cgi, there are a lot of beautiful and colorful places in Africa for great photography to be used in the film. Grey and brown mush is what you can expect. In general, all the actors do a good job. I don't really know who to blame for this overrated film. The studio or the audience with their political agenda. I always want to like a film. This had so much potential. But still. I'd give it a weak 6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,1/10,"The overhypeness of this film killed it. Very predictable and not very entertaining. No memorable ""superhero"" theme songs and a lot of plot holes. What was the point of this movie and how was it related at all to Captain America Civil War?? I have to say, I had to fight the urge of walking out of the theatres. T'Challa, Shuri, Klaw, Nakia, and W'kabi were phenomenal but this film felt like the white man's version of Africa and tried to somehow put Black Lives Matter into it? Very embarrassing. Michael B Jordan I hate to say it was sub par and overly dramatic even cringy at times.Would not watch again, I'm afraid. Would forget this movie by next year. Belongs imo in the category of one of the worst Marvel movies along with Daredevil, Fantastic Four and possibly the Ant-man series which were quite boring as well."
BLACK PANTHER,21 August 2020,9/10,"So I'll be honest, the first time I saw this movie, I passed out due to lack of sleep from the night before, and missed the second third of the movie. Finally watching fully for the first time, it was a great movie. A superhero movie, but also bringing up themes of equality and by-standing. Everyone acted great in this movie. The score, production and costume design all rightfully won their awards for bringing a beautiful, African society to life. Killmonger was a very realistic, and major threat to his hero counterpart. He had some good points, but radicalized then into toxic ideas. Also, a comical movie at points. Some of the action scenes did look a bit like video game cutscenes, but I still thought it looked good. Also, I love how strong the women are in this movie. Spies, tech wizards, and the strongest warriors in Wakanda."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,9/10,"What truly stands out about Black Panther in particular compared to other MCU entries is the large canvas of characters, yet all fully realized with their own goals and convictions. And finally we have a villain who doesn't just show up to terrorize people and blow things up, here, Killmonger's presence is what causes T'Challa to look within himself and realize his weaknesses. It's also a film filled with timely social commentary, a touch of Shakespearean drama, nuanced and charismatic performances from the cast, and an amazing score from Ludwig G√∂ransson which featured an overlapping layers of percussion. The only downside of the film is the climactic sequence in Wakanda's dark underground vibranium mine."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,2/10,"Talk about over-hyped. 
1. Boring story - relentless boring banter between characters. Typical story that's been told a million times. Nothing wrong with that as such, but equally, doesn't add to the experience.
2. Bad acting - acting was wooden (with the exception of Forest Whitaker). Felt like you were watching a live amateur play where the characters are reading live from a script.
3. Boring action - if you can manage to put up with the boring dialogue, then there's little to gain from the action. Very average at best, something you would expect in a TV episode.
4. CGI - the CGI effects are something along the lines of a good TV series, not really up there with a top movie production.To Sum UpDue to the wooden acting, the movie lacks passion. With the predictable non-exciting story and the action and CGI being average, Black Panther is simply dull and boring."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"This is a great origin story. I have no idea who The Black Panther is or where he came from but left the film knowing all I needed to know. I thought the acting was good - with guards and royalty rightly subdued. Some complaints have said they're acting ""wooden"" but - no - they're acting with decorum. You wouldn't have a King act like, for example, Deadpool. The characters were mostly well-thought out with the exception of Killmonger whom I found a little lacking. He was enjoyable enough but - one minute he isn't there, then he is and this is his story thrown in quick. Okay then... It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film but given the length (over 2 hours), perhaps they could have trimmed elsewhere to show more of him too? The start of the film was a little muddled with the directing of the action sequence, which was a little hard to tell what was going on but thankfully it became better with later action sequences. As for action, there isn't a lot due to the story being told but what there was, was exciting enough even though - certain scenes - you knew how they would play out. For example, you know this person won't win this particular showdown because of whom they're up against, kind of thing.The humour in this film isn't as much as other films but, again, it fits the world the story is in. Stan Lee's cameo was nice ;) I do like the fact he pops up in all of the films! The scenery in the film was glorious, the CGI done properly (not like a certain DC film that came out recently). What I will say though, I went in thinking I would hate this film because the trailer just looked dull. I'm glad I went regardless. I'm not sure how they would do a good trailer for this without giving all of the action sequences away but... Yep... As far as Marvel Origin stories go, I believe this is one of the stronger despite a few niggles. I look forward to seeing more of Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,8/10,"The first hit of the year. Starting 2018 off in a good way, Black Panther was able to continue the Marvel way, and provide a timely, fun, and thought provoking film. 
 Marvel has proven they will not back down from the current themes in the US. With the tensions and focus on inequality between race and gender building in the past few years, Black Panther has come out on the forefront of the movement, showing how powerful a movie can be, with an almost completely black cast, and a movie that really used women in prominent roles.
 Black Panther took us on a journey into a ""world"" never seen before. Showing us Wakanda, a land that has found itself right in the juxtaposition of modern and advanced civilization, with a very primal and ancestral culture. They played up this juxtaposition and then put it to the test. With the arrival of Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, they were forced to ask the question, ""what do we do, when we don't trust our leader?""
 In a culture, where you put your trust in your leader to protect you, this brought them into a new test of ""what does the future look like"" in the advancing times, and the changing atmospheres in both the movie and real life. The movie comes to the climax of moving forward.
 Played marvelously throughout, the cast played off of each other so well, expressing their turmoil in their own, personal ways, they each provided a unique view that drove the tense storyline. 
 This is definitely a movie that will continue the Marvel story line. Even though it really was a standalone movie, Black Panther will be a movie that will be remembered and one that may in the end, help to define 2018 in film."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,9/10,"'Black Panther' is not only an achievement for its mainly-black cast and positive representations of women, but it is also an exhilarating and meaningful superhero film. Before even this film had hit cinemas, it was already getting acclaim for the fact that this is a blockbuster superhero film and nearly everyone in the film is a person of color. This accomplishment only gets better once you actually see the film, and see a broad range of black characters that are not stereotyped, one-dimensional or a product of tokenism. To make things even better, the representation of women in this film is on point - they are not sexualized or dependent on their male counterparts. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira lead out the strong female characters fiercely, equally giving strong performances that affirmed that they are both tremendous actresses. Every cast member in this film does a great job in their role, with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, and Andy Serkis being the male standouts. As for the storyline, it's as good as a superhero film plot can get. There are enough plot twists to save the film from its ultimately predictable ending that is in pretty much every superhero film. It was refreshing to have a break from the whole ""save-the-world"" trope and have a change of focus to identity, culture, and humanity - and still, have badass action sequences in the process. The soundtrack to this film is nothing short of awesome, with its strong African-influence combined with an epic orchestral score making it one of the best superhero scores I have heard. Overall, 'Black Panther' is a triumph due to being a brilliant film in its own right, and also for its positive representations of minority groups. We need more films like this one."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,7/10,"Simply tells origination of Black Panther, the born and joining Avengers eventually. I enjoy the movie and get nothing after. Smooth and predictable plot. It is an okay from me."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,5/10,"The description of this movie on IMDB.com summarize the movie. The movie is a cultural enjoyable journey of a super hero.(Black Panther) the character caught my eyes first time in ""captain America: civil war"" movie, his agility like a panther got me excited to see more of him in this movie. The most of the this movie showcases African visually stunning culture -which I didn't mind watching - and few of modern references specially in US. There are times I felt that I've been taken away by the visual effects, the set, and the music and forgot to concentrate on the movie plot it self. I will try to be fair as possible as I can.. This movie begins where ""captain America: civil war"" ended, the Wakanda throne is going to be taken by the elder son of the previous king ""black panther"" and little less than third of this movie given to this portion then a threat to Wakanda must be dealt with by the newly crowned king as of his new duties as king ""black panther"".. conflict of the many tribes ruled by the Wakanda's king wasn't raised until the new king arrived and with the new threat, that put lot of responsibilities on the new king.. very simple and straight forward story line but with an addition to a super powered king and country that posses advanced technology that no one have on earth. Simple plot with most expected spectrum of emotions and enjoyable action and humor."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,6/10,"This is a comic book action movie. It is fine for an average 17-year-old boy. Anyone with a college degree, persons over 50 and children under 12 should not see this film. It's violent and kind of stupid.The best part of this movie is the CGI landscapes of the fictional kingdom of Wakanda. Otherwise, it's bam, smash, pow. I've been trying to figure out why so many people rave about this film and I concluded it's because of its black power message. I would rather watch a documentary about the civil rights movement. This film is absurd, which is fine for a comic book movie aimed at teens, but to try to find some type of ""message"" here is a waste of your time. I was also amused that the hero is an absolute monarch, like that's something black people (or anyone) should think is a model of a government."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"We finally get a peek behind the curtain at the mythical Wakanda, a nation and its protector the Black Panther, that have been hinted at and built up since Age of Ultron (or even earlier, if you count the Easter egg in Iron Man 2), and while this film does not fail to provide us with great action scenes and vibrant culture scenes, as well as probably the most interesting Marvel villain since Loki in Killmonger, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong: every scene with Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa is near perfect, both inside the Black Panther suit and out.His story in this film picks up a short time after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where his father King T'Chaka was killed in Vienna, and T'Challa must ascend to the throne of Wakanda. But, other forces are pushing him in a darker direction, and he must choose what kind of a king he must be.The film shines whenever we get to see T'Challa interact with his fellow cast members. Whether it be with Forrest Whittaker's character, Zuri, an elder statesman and friend of T'Chaka, or T'Challa's sister Shuri, played beautifully by Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman seems to have good chemistry with just about everyone.The film also boasts a great villain in Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. While his performance may feel only a hair more than one-note, his character development and motivations are some of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Much like Loki, the conflict derives from a family connection. Unlike Loki, his cause is something you can actually see yourself supporting to some degree.Where this film falters, at least in my view, is in the seeming lack of character development in almost anyone else in the film. Aside from T'Challa, his friend and ex-lover Nakia, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is the only one who has an easily identifiable character arc. Everyone else seems to stay in their own little bubbles, which is fine for some, but those who probably should have developed but didn't is a little frustrating.Also lacking is the seeming paint-by-numbers of the whole thing. The action scenes are impressive and there are the occasional jokes that land almost always, but it just feels a little too self-serious in its delivery, and when it tries to be light-hearted or semi-silly (mainly the scenes with Andy Serkis's Ulysses Klaue) it's jarring to say the least, mostly because it feels very forced.Nevertheless, this film is without a doubt a culturally important film, and true to form the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to produce a truly bad film. However, I still rank Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man ahead of this one."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,Nothing new in the movie just the movie is overrated by the kids. One time watch movie because of the title. They wanted to make it epic but they failed. Its not the acting its the story. Story is very weak to keep the viewers engaged. I almost felt asleep most of times and didn't wanted to continue. I'll never recommend it to anyone. It is better for society and people Wakanda should be hidden.
BLACK PANTHER,8 July 2018,1/10,"All-black ok! That is its only achievement. Best part is Lamar' music. It looks good, it aims high, the idea is there, yo make something outstanding, but really it lacks a good story behind. Quickly becomes victim of its grandiosity. Ok the country wakanda is the most developed technologically in the world but invisible, and finally goes to the UN to announce it will help the rest of the world. You wished!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,,"The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is ""Black Panther"", the first Marvel film featuring a predominantly black cast. Black Panther first appeared in ""Captain America: Civil War"", with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated. Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero. Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to ""spread the colour"" with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though ""Black Panther"" is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of ""falling only to rise once more"" (both literally and metaphorically). From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" when it had the capability to surpass ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen)."
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2020,6/10,The second third of the film sucks... and the ending was cheesy and lame. Michael Jordan was awful... when he's on screen it loses all credibility.... If it was remixed it would be as good as the 'critics' score.
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,2/10,"I got to watch this for free as I was sitting in a plane with a 12 hour flight ahead of me.During a flight I am undemanding in the quality of a film as long as there is some entertainment.After half an hour I gave up - same old story, same cliches, poor dialogue and acting.I had a choice - continue to watch or have a nap. I took a nap."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,1/10,"I was thinking about what i could write in this review, but there is nothing left of the movie. Nothing is relevant for the Marvel story, it is just another cashgrab and a political statement. Simply the worst marvel movie to date."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2019,3/10,"Filled with so many cliches about black people it made it hard to watch. It had some good moments, but then something stupid would happen. Just because the Oscar's didn't nominate any black actors one year, it doesn't mean they need to nominate a mediocre movie for best picture, just because of all the black actors in it. Ugh.
Anyway, I was really looking forward to seeing Black Panther, after hearing all the hype. I was disappointed, as was everyone who saw it with me. Movies need to be about PEOPLE, not white people, or black people, or yellow people. I thought we've moved past this type of thing.
As a superhero movie, it was one of the most forgettable in recent years. Of course I sometimes like to watch movies of this type, even if they aren't the best. I may even watch it again someday. Maybe I'll like it more once the hype dies down, and I don't have any expectations. Some of the characters were very interesting, and I'd like to see more of them, with a better script."
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2021,10/10,"I appreciate the gift of more American Watson, and cats. Don't think I forgot that guy who barks and wears summer clothes in the winter. It's like he was waiting for the plot of this movie this whole time. I have never enjoyed a movie so aggressively non-Western until now. No Regrets <3 <3 <3."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is one of the most incredible things I've ever, ever seen. The women are AMAZING. The score and sound design are incredible - it's the best score I've ever heard in any film. It's visually beautiful beyond description. I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel film, and I like Marvel films. It has IDEAS, political thought and a worldview in a way that no other Marvel film has attempted, and is meaningful and resonant in a way blockbusters almost never are. It's deeply non-western. The villain's motivation is understandable and relatable, overcoming the MCU villain problem for probably the first time ever. The cast are tremendous. It's an afrofuturist dream and is, throughout, deeply moving. It's transformative not feelgood, deep not glib, unifying and courageous not divisive. It's better than Harry Potter, better than LOTR, better than The Hunger Games, better than the entire MCU. It takes everything tired about the superhero/epic fantasy/""hero's journey"" genre and transcends/ reconceptualizes it in a way that's never expected and consistently thrilling and gripping. It's impeccably paced and structured and flows completely naturally (in a world where blockbusters are so often a series of setpieces bridged by interstitial dialogue) - it's logical and coherent with plot and character in perfect harmony, nothing feels contrived, committee-written, focus-grouped or market-tested. I'm in absolute raptures over it. It kicks its entire genre out of the park.This is a film that says you don't have to give up your traditions to be modern and developed. That non-westerners shouldn't be ashamed of their culture and give up their customs, their dress, their music, their dances, everything that gives their culture an identity and that's grown up over hundreds of years, in the rush to westernize. That allows its characters to debate the merits and drawbacks of isolationism versus outreach. This is a revolutionary film that should and will have a huge cultural footprint lasting decades and mean a lot to so many young people. It not only articulates debates between constructive activism and destructive activism, hard and soft power, but has the conviction of its principles to come down on one side of them. It deserves to have a cultural impact as big as the original Star Wars."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,7/10,"It was a good Marvel movie with good story beats. I can definitely appreciate (some of) the CG and the unique conflict that's brought up in the film, but you don't have to dig too deep to see the ol' Marvel formula hard at work. But, it's overall a good time worth a watch (but was definitely over-hyped)."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2019,7/10,"The first thing that struck me about Black Panther was visual imagery. From a simple detail like a milk cart for a net on a street basketball court to the way the spectators were placed for the ritual over the waterfall to the pastures and futuristic urban landscape of Wakanda. Then came the questions. Like, if your country is in possession of something valuable that allowed you to make extraordinary progress and give your citizens good lives, do you keep it to yourself or do you help others at a risk of losing it all? The movie answers this in a rather naive, simplistic manner. Well, it kind of had to, being a superhero movie. Just as it had to have all those silly fights and rhino robots. But it also had a villain whose goal is actually quite noble, making things beautifully complicated. And that, along with the actual beauty of which there was so much, made it well worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2021,8/10,"The acting was great, the costumes and settings were well done and the script was very good.Though i think it got so much hype bein the best marvel/DC Comics movie only because the cast is dominantly all black.It is the first of its kind for a comic movie so it deserves the hype but i wouldnt go as far to say its the best. I think this movie was so successful besides it was well directed as well as because its a dominant black movie so every black person i know and their family went to see it.As well other races who went to see it cause its marvel.While other marvel movies will have other races attend as well but not have such a huge following for anyone black that isnt a fan of marvel comics themselves."
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,2/10,"This movie had me cringeing with embarrassment for everyone involved, and anyone who rated it highly. If Hollywood is so keen to avoid the ""racist"" label, let's have a black superman, or Batman or whatever, there's no shortage of talent that could fill those shoes (Idris Elba is my choice). But to create a whole movie purporting to be a superhero movie, but starts off telling us how much better the world would be without 19thC European colonialism is a new low. This movie is so keen to be nice to Africans, it's actually creepy. I doubt you'd see Prince Charles and Prince William brawling in public for the throne, but there you go. I paid to be entertained, but for the first time ever I left a cinema halfway through a movie, fuguring the bus ride home would be more fun. It was."
BLACK PANTHER,27 June 2019,8/10,The MCU's truest drama comes through in the villain department more than any other Marvel movie other than maybe Infinity War. The dynamic between Tachalla and Erik is great as they both challenge one another in their own flaws as characters. The story works especially well because the hero is flawed and needs correction from none other than our villain. Visuals are little sloppy and the narrative is a bit disconnected in the middle but still a dramatic superhero showdown.
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2021,6/10,"That's the whole story. You could have already guessed it from the title, but I didn't and I want my money back."
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2018,5/10,"I am Korean and come on. The Koreans in this movie couldn't speak Korean. The casino was in Chinese style. Not Korean. I know this is Hollywood production and no American will know the difference but there also are millions of Koreans watching this movie. Is it too much to ask?The story was very unconvincing and predictable. They had Vibranium and superior technology for thousands of years, chose not to share it and hide inside the mountain? Not even try to conquer outside of Wakanda? Why? Are they trying to say black people are dumb?Ancient Wakanda tradition to challenge for throne but they use UFC yield rule? Not fight till death? And once they lose, they don't accept? Didn't die and didn't yield so it doesn't count? What kind of tradition is this? That's like going to hospital in the middle of boxing match and come back to fight again.Lastly, there has to be better black actors than these. Come on. They were just reading book. There's no young black actor to replace Danzel Washington and Will Smith?"
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,7/10,"I would never have expected for ""Black Panther"", out of all superheroes, to be so engaging and thought-provoking as this film was. Ryan Coogler is known for being a smart director, but here he completely breaks the usual scheme of simple, one-dimensional characters siding for good against evil and creates some of the most unique heroes ever made for the cinema screen. Killmonger, a barely known villain, is elevated to a complex personality, filled with rage and vengeance, and it's not unreasonable to actually understand his points. After all, he does nothing legally wrong, but he's overthrown for a supposed greater good. Now, this is what a great protagonist-antagonist interaction is about. 
Every actor gives their best, especially the lead, Boseman: the accent invented for Wakandans is so unique, and he manages to play beautifully with words through it.On the cons notes, there still are a couple, which doesn't let ""Black Panther"" enter the masterpiece zone: 
1) The gags are forced, a problem many MCU movies share. Producers should understand that laughter is not a necessity all the time, and there can be a Marvel movie where the public just doesn't laugh. The result in a movie like this one is a huge cringe-effect when jokes are evidently juxtaposed for such goal. There are a couple decent ones, but they are exceptions.
2) The other problem virtually all Marvel movies share, the inevitable bombastic, over-predictable final fight. In particular, I found the CIA operative an uninspired addition to the cast in this section, as well as the sudden atonement of W'Kabi."
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2020,1/10,"Black panther is an awful film, it just won some oscars because of its political propaganda"
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2019,10/10,"This is a great film but I think the hype affected people's feeling towards it. When something get much hyped, it is extra critically reviewed and analysed."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther leaps off the screen in a dazzling adventure with a decidedly unique Afro-futuristic vibe. Director Ryan Coogler may have started out with independent dramas but his style feels at home within the MCU.Set not long after CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, the film follows T'Challa, the newly christened king of Wakanda as he combats evil forces from outside and from within his own nation.From a visual standpoint, BLACK PANTHER has one of the most beautifully rendered superhero worlds since the cosmic setting in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The city and landscape of Wakanda are artistically stylized as one might expect from an advanced African metropolis. The costumes and props seem practical within the MCU universe. Amazon warriors, prosthetic cannons, battle rhinos, and combat by waterfall don't seem out of place in this continuity. The nearly all-black supporting cast is mostly strong. Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are both excellent as the villains; Jordan is especially great and perhaps the best and intimidating MCU villain since Ultron. Lupita Nyong'o is that rare capable love interest that you don't see often in comic book movies. In fact, all the female characters are strong, resilient, and play a role in the plot. Given the comparatively darker tone, both Leticia Wright and Martin Freeman lighten the mood as Black Panther's sister and CIA contact respectfully so.What's interesting is its tone and subject matter. Unafraid to incorporate politics into its plot, BLACK PANTHER boasts the usual stuff like action and spectacle, but its timely message of inclusiveness and altruism versus hatred and revenge ring so true for the present day. It's bold for a blockbuster, especially a superhero movie to proudly embrace the creativeness with an African setting and all black cast. Even rarer is the maturity to call attention to pressing social issues but condemn militant retribution as more radical elements often call for. Yes it addresses racism and other problems suffered by black people. There is already a backlash against the movie because of this. But it's conscious enough to not take the stance that means 'white people are evil' or 'black people should riot or take over'. For heaven's sake, the main antagonist Killmonger (Jordan) is an embittered black nationalist whose actions are condemned in favor of more peaceful measures. One would think the internet would be happy that an SJW is the villain but whatever. Sporting high tech gadgets, a wide cast of memorable characters, a kickass soundtrack, and even social commentary to boot, BLACK PANTHER starts the year 2018 right."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2019,10/10,"Black Panther is one of those movies that, years from now, everyone will look back at and ask ""how did this not win all the awards?"" It's intricate, filled with such a world, and remains entertaining all the same.Writing/Direction: Ryan Coogler, man. Yes. The dude really knows how to make a movie. From his directional touch that really pulls us into the world of Wakanda to the writing that creates such vivid characters that really go to their full potential, Ryan Coogler has created a masterpiece not only as a superhero movie, but as a general film.Performances: Chadwick Boseman IS T'challa and is practically perfect in his casting. He's great, no denying it. The thing that intrigued me, however, is how he seemed a bit outplayed by his supporting ensemble. No offense to Chadwick, but there's a lot more at play than the lead in this film and I really appreciate that. The women of Wakanda are especially badass. Lupita, Danai, and Letita shine as Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively. They're fantastic female characters who have fantastic performers behind them. I could say some stuff about Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis, who both give off appealing enough performances, Angela Basset, who practically plays herself (very well I might add), the formidable and capable Winston Duke, and Daniel Kalluya, who continues to hold his own. However, I firmly believe none of them hold a candle to Michael B. Jordan's performance as the central villain, Erik Killmonger. He gains our sympathy throughout the film while still being a fairly intimidating villain with complex motives and reasoning that makes the viewer (and T'challa) think. He gives a performance that puts him at the top of the Marvel villain list (not quite at the top of all CBM villains, I mean, Heath Ledger amiright?).I still insist on praising just about every aspect of this film. Tell me you haven't listened to Ludwig Goranssen's killer soundtrack and it hasn't gotten stuck in your head. Tell me you weren't mesmerized by the production design that made Wakanda so palatable. Tell me you weren't impressed by the beautiful costumes, well-choreographed fights, and awesome cinematography that was shown throughout. (The only thing that holds merit is some CGI issues, but even then, consider their challenge and look at the beautiful establishing shots of Wakanda and tell me that's not some beautifully rendered CGI.)Black Panther is a fully realized world with vibrant characters and an engrossing tale and serves as a new standard for filmmaking. (10/10)"
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,8/10,Loved it...ppl just dont get it...whatever I loved it
BLACK PANTHER,26 July 2019,2/10,"While I didn't hate it, it certainly had nothing worthy of the 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings it got, or being nominated for 6 Oscars including best picture. Anyone with an ounce of integrity watched this and said meh. It is definitely not a stand out MCU film, There are far better and far more engaging. It works best as a stand alone as nothing within it really impacts on the MCU in any meaningful way.I found the CGI in parts to be laughably bad, especially the fight between the two Black Panthers towards the end. There was some very cringey lines and nonsensical plot threads but overall it works. There were parts that were purely inserted political statements and a super hero action film is hardly the place for Hollywood to try and make some grand social statement but that doesn't seem to stop them these days. Acting was fine for the most part.All in all it was thoroughly forgettable and I can't imagine me going back for a second watch. If you haven't seen it yet go in with low expectations as the critics are so out of touch on this one. No film could achieve the lofty heights their reviews would lead you to expect."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"I guess if you like the other typical Marvel material then I guess you'll like this. The Marvel movies of today are mostly just cartoons for adults, and Black Panther isn't really any different. At various points in the movie I was able to call what was going to happen, play by play. ""Here comes another PG13, CGI action sequence"".In terms of all of political hub-bub, I'm not really going to comment on that except to say I'm not sure why *anyone* is pretending like there has never been a movie starring a black dude before. Who knows.Aside from the dumb jokes and derivative visual effects, director Ryan Coogler was also cool enough to make sure to shoot all of the fight scenes with shaky cam, a la every movie from 2005-2009. Like I said, it's not for me, but if you happen to like the newer batch of Marvel movies, then knock yourself out."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is about King T'challa returning home to mourn his fathers death and become the new ruler of Wakanda. But the king first has to take care of obstacles, mainly his fathers nemesis, and a challenger for the throne.This film is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed), the other writer is Joe Robert Cole (American Crime Story). It stars Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) as the titular Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) as the villainess Erik Killmonger and Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) as Black Panthers love interest Nakia.This film is outstanding to look at, the visual effects for the film are great expecially the backgrounds of Wakanda. the direction is fantastic aswell, with director Ryan Coogler using long takes and gorgeous landscape shots. The score by Ludwig Goransson (Creed) is fantastic as well. What I love most about Black Panther though is that it is unlike any other marvel movie, focusing on the characters more than action and comedy makes it stand out from other marvel movies. Which makes it more memorable. The cast is great, the stand outs are Martin Freeman (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) as Everett K. Ross and Letitia Wright (The Commuter) as Black Panthers sister Shuri.I loved this film, in my opinion this is the best Marvel movie yet.10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,27 December 2018,8/10,Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories -- and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2020,5/10,"I love the MCU, but, there have been one or two movies that are much weaker than the rest; the first Captain America movie and The Incredible Hulk weren't that great and now add Black Panther.
It could have been so great, but, it lost me when we're told that it was hidden from the rest of the world. Pre spy satellite days you could have got away with that premise, but, not today. I was expecting them to explain how they have a shield over the main city to hide it from satellites, but, the writers clearly expected us to swallow the idea that it was not visible, for goodness sake, they can spot Kim Jong Un's train sitting on a siding in satellite photos. There was a total lack of logic regarding the premise of Wakanda being hidden from the rest of the world. By the way, Erik flew a plane into Wakanda without any problem, but, no else had done it before? Come on.
That aside, Chadwick Boseman is just so bland. I didn't warm to him in Civil War and I thought they could round out the character better in his own movie, I was wrong. The female characters were strong, which was one of the few pluses. The costume design was outstanding.
At the end of the day, it is entertaining, but, a best film Oscar nomination? No, especially considering movies like Thor:Ragnarok and Captain Marvel are many times better and not even got a hint of an Oscar nomination.
I'm not telling anyone not to watch it, but, don't listen to the professional critics as this time their praise for this movie was undeserved."
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2019,9/10,"Black Panther has become such a contentious issue on the internet. Many people seem to be butt-hurt that it got an Oscar nomination and most people find it overrated. I swear I sometimes think overblown media hype can ruin a perfectly good movie. And I want to preface my review by saying this: if you're white and you did not like the movie that's perfectly fine I do not think you're racist. And if you're black and you did not like the movie, I don't think you're an uncle tom. Yes, as a black man I enjoy seeing myself on-screen that's a given.But I'm still going to talk about it as a movie because this is my review. I want to start with the positives: I love the world-building of Wakanda it's fascinating for me to see an African nation unfettered by European Imperialism. And Ryan Coogler gets a lot of mileage out of playing with the Afro futurism aspects of Wakanda. You get a sense that each African tribe in Wakanda has their own history and culture, which adds a lot of texture to the movie. On the character side, you have T'Challa and Suri who have a great dynamic as brother and sister.Suri is essentially Black Panther's Q designing his gadgets for his various missions. The film also addresses the isolationism of Wakanda and T'Challa debates with his colleagues about whether Wakanda should open its borders to countries in need. In terms of the villain the film also shines with the character of Killmonger. Killmonger is essentially a tragic Magneto figure that's been twisted by racism and turned into a monster. And I appreciate that the film doesn't shy away from the systemic racism Killmonger endured in America. However, if I find any fault with the film is that Killmonger didn't get any kind of redemption arc, he's just vanquished like any other MCU villain and that's a shame. I would have love to see T'Challa and Killmonger as allies in the sequel. There's also some spotty CGI in the last battle between Black Panther and Killmonger. For the life of me, I don't understand how a 200 million dollar blockbuster has CGI that looks like a cut-scene from a PS2 game. But small quibbles aside, Black Panther is a remarkable achievement in cinema, it made a cultural statement and was entertaining at the same time which is no easy feat."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Every time I think Marvel has produced a great movie the studio outdoes itself. With its latest release, 'Black Panther', it reaches unimaginable heights. I felt extremely proud watching this movie. It changes the conversation and gives us a new hero, a relatable hero. Heroes aren't defined by a certain race or culture and Black Panther embraces its roots while telling a captivating story. Exhilarating, emotional, and impactful- this one is a game changer.We were introduced to T'Challa, Black Panther, in 'Captain America: Civil War' a couple of years ago. His strength and conviction stood out then and I looked forward to seeing his story. After his father's untimely demise T'Challa takes the throne of Wakanda, a mysterious and isolated country in Africa that is years ahead of the rest of the world. Black Panther works as an origin story, a thriller, a social narrative, and a family saga all rolled into one. There's immense depth and a strong voice leading the film. The action is sharp and eye popping. There's grit and wit in equal measure and it doesn't shy away from hurtful truths. It's exactly what you want from a superhero movie and so much more.Director Ryan Coogler has shown Wakanda and its people with tremendous admiration. The characters are fully fleshed out and unapologetically black. Their pride is envy worthy. It's deeply gratifying to be able to identify with a character on screen. But an entire nation? It was unheard of before this film. The backbone of the movie, a compelling screenplay, plays out wonderfully on screen and is both moving and amusing. There's never a dull moment with these characters. And what beautiful characters!Chadwick Boseman leads the pack with his terrific portrayal of T'Challa- a man overcoming obstacles, a king trying to find his way, and a hero who has barely scratched the surface. The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Michael B. Jordan brings the right amount of menace and angst to his character creating a villain you want to root for. Another highlight of the movie, or I should say its strongest attribute, is the powerful women. Warriors, intellectuals, leaders, and spies. Each one stronger than the king, each one deserving of her own movie. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright are perfect. I am in awe.Representation matters. We hear it, we say it, and now we see it in action. Never again will a person of color have to wonder what it would be like to look like their heroes. As an avid movie watcher I'm filled with joy. Black Panther is an experience to be treasured. This panther comes at you claws out and rearing to go. Wakanda forever!

BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2020,7/10,This was not even close to the best marvel movie. It had a decent stotybut very ordinary. The technologyaspect was cool but this kinda character falling to rise back up has been done so much. It was not as good as winter soldier or doctor strange.
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2018,3/10,"I think the Marvel writers think that a strong story is unnecessary if this is anything to go by. I am so bored of CGI and such weak stories, and am shocked that so many people seem to rate this movie highly."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"Firstly I've got to hand it to Marvel. They have not only created one of the most impressive shared universes ever established in cinema history but they consistently keep bringing quality movies to the masses year after year. Not all have been earth shattering masterpieces but almost all have been of above average quality and always entertaining. Without beating around the bush, Black Panther is yet another great addition to this shared Marvel universe and has just enough character and style of its own to make it stand out from the others. The element of Black Panther I absolutely loved was the overarching story and the motivations behind all the characters. Never have I been more closely connected with each and every character in a Marvel film as I did in this one. To fully understand why they were doing what they were doing and what was driving them. Refreshingly even the main villain had a genuine reason for his actions and at times even made me question why I was so against him and routing for the other guys. This mash-up of motives and emotions really set Black panther apart from the rest. Not only that but the acting is of some of the highest quality there is. Stand out performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. This guy just demanded your attention and completely owned every scene he was in. He balanced the dislike you felt for him perfectly and I found myself flitting from hatred to understanding numerous times throughout, by far one of my favourite villains in a Marvel film in a long time. Chadwick Boseman returns as the main protagonist after we first met him in 2016's Captain America Civil War and I was excited to see him again, although his performance didn't blow me away and he seemed to lack that special something that I get from the other MCU players. Now I mentioned I loved the story and the message it brings with it however I did feel the plot itself was quite predictable and clich√©, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect to happen, happens. As great as the special effects are and as fun as some of the character scenes are, nothing is very memorable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the entire film that made me sit forward in my seat or really get my pulse going. To put it in context, I got that tingly excitement within the run time of the latest infinity war trailer, but not once through the 2h 14min runtime of Black Panther. As mentioned in a few other Marvel origin stories, the lack of emotion from me as a viewer is possibly linked to the fact we already know T'Challa (Black Panther) will appear in the next movie and is likely to get a number of sequels of his own... No amount of death fake outs will have that emotional tug on me the creators are so desperately trying to make me feel. This is perhaps something impossible to avoid when you have a universe such as this but it undoubtedly takes away any kind of worry you may have for the main superhero. One element the movie excels in is in its special effects. The majority of the film takes place in the fiction city of Wakanda and its mighty impressive, with its own unique mash-up of a technically advanced civilisation that still holds onto its ancient culture. The costumes, makeup, and excellent original soundtrack is something to behold. So as the plot plays out rather passively with little in the shape of memorable moments, Black Panther does bring with it a wonderful message of a world coming together and touches on a number of things that are quite prominent in today's current political climate. Marvel should be applauded for bringing together such a rich and diverse cast and creating a wonderfully unique world within its ever expanding universe. It expertly manages to establish the soul of T'Challa, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, and sets him up perfectly going into Avengers Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2018,10/10,"I loved this movie, because of the amazing story,the character, the villain and because it was awesome. The villain - Killmonger was well planned and was cool. This movie broke many records, so that just proves of how well it was made."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2020,3/10,"It's not that good, in fact it's pretty bad. The CGI was terrible at some points and the story was pretty lackluster."
BLACK PANTHER,11 December 2018,8/10,The acting was brilliant and the CGI was reasonably good. The sound track was great and the storyline became very clear part way through the movie. It was full of plot twists and unexpected actions which were good. The plot in general was also fairly strong and the script wasn't poor. Great for the family and once into it the story line is easy to follow for younger audiences. It had its comical elements along with its sad ones so I would recommend watching this movie!
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2019,8/10,"Watched this film on IMAX 3d screen. It was spectacularly splendid...ohh the visual effects!!! T'chala aka the Black Panther was amazing, so was the rest of Wakanda. Had heard a lot about this movie and its maddening collection records, so decided to go experience it at the right place. Wakanda is one of the places where the infinity war will take place...can't wait"
BLACK PANTHER,12 November 2021,8/10,"This was a great movie, story is great, music was also nice, it's like a modern day superhero action theme but with cultural instruments added, the style was pretty different and the all the Wakanden things were great black panther was also nice and killmonger was a great villain, some of the cgi was a little off, and one of the big fight scenes looked more like a ps4 game than a modern day MCU movie. Just overall a pretty decent movie with some great aspect's to it."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2019,1/10,"After finally watching the movie I'm incredibly disappointed. I don't understand how this is so highly praised by both critics and audiences.I cringed throughout most of the movie. Let's leave aside all the plot holes and other nonsense. I found the portrayal of black people in this movie downright insulting.The movie is desperately trying to be PC. But the superior black Wakandan race in the movie is insanely stereotypical. I mean, skip all the weird nonsense about this superior, warrior, genius race of black people hiding all their superior tech from the ""colonizers"" and others.From the accents to the dancing it's revoltingly insultinging towards black people. It's like some white dude thought of the most stereotypical stuff he could imagine about black people. Then watched a few documentaries about remote African tribes and mixed them all together. I was waiting for them to start yelling ""UGA BUGA"" it was insane. The only reason why this movie isn't slammed into the ground for being incredibly tackles, is because the black people in this imaginary country are basically a superior race. But for some reason they still fight with spears, have stereotypical accents, bones trough their noses and plates trough their lips, as if they are some backward tribe. Why don't they have guns? Why the accents? No other group of people in these super hero movies have such accents. Thor doesn't speak with a stereotypical Norse accent and his people aren't all white. Why do they base their king on who is the strongest? Why do they constantly do weird stereotypical dances with literally everything. Every time they all meet everyone starts to shake their body while making weird noises, barking etc.
OK.. Humor me for a second. Imagine if they make a movie about an Asian hero and call it ""yellow tiger"". The hero comes from a superior Asian race and their culture is a mix of the most stereotyped parts of all kinds of different Asian peoples and they all speak ""Engrish"" with a heavy ""Asian"" accent, walk around in straw hats, bow after every sentence etc etc. Can you imagine how insulting that would be for Asians?
Also movie takes this weird American idea of ""black people"" like all black people are the same ethnicity / group. Eventhough, like Europeans, Asians, MENA people's they are all different people with different cultures, traditions, languages and values.
I cringed trough every second of this movie. They could have made the Wakandans distinctly African without having to resort to dumb stereotypes.HO and this one part was INSANE. The Wakandans don't want to help other black Africans or humans in general (but they emphasize black people). Because they don't want refugees and don't want their country to become ""like anywhere else in the world"" (paraphrasing). So much for multi culturalism, humanism and helping those less fortunate."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"SPOILERS BELOW!Very few movies give me the thrill of discovery. Fewer still give me a sense of wonder or touch my heart. Black Panther ticked all my boxes. I throughly enjoyed this movie. True, there was a lot of hype going in. Marvel worked the numbers and made sure every person on earth with an Internet connection had access to snippets of the movie and trailers were released to keep the momentum going. I feared that this over exposure would work to the film's detriment. When the release date was announced, I thought, ""cute. release it during Black History Month. heavy handed much?"" I went in prepared to be disappointed. I was NOT disappointed. The level of excitement within the Black community where I live was high. Sure, we had Blade but that was over ten years ago. There was Spawn but, no reflection on Michael Jai White, who wants to identify with demon reject from Hell? I mean, really?? Other superheros of color? Don't think so. Sure, sidekick roles aplenty but nothing uniquely ours. I got to the theater in Vicksburg, Mississippi and was surprised at the lines waiting to get tickets. I bought my ticket on-line in anticipation of this very thing but the number of people waiting was more than I thought would be in attendance. Oh, and some people came dressed in their best Afrocentric garb. How cool was that?Black Panther is more than a superhero origin flick. It is a genre bashing tour-de-force. It is indeed an origin story but it also includes some spy elements. There's some royal family hijinks and socio-political commentary. None of it is too heavy handed to get in the way of a rollicking good time.a Chadwick Boseman is on point as the titular character. We find him just as he is taking on the mantle of King of Wakanda and Protector The Black Panther. He survives a challenge by one of the leaders of a border tribe. But doesn't have time to settle into his role before he is challenged, again, by the long lost son of his uncle. A cousin he never knew he had. So the sins of the father are now visited upon the son. Michael B. Jordan wears the role of villain well. His Killmonger is filled with a justifiable rage. He challenges and 'kills' T'Challa' to secure the throne of Wakanda and the title of Black Panther. That's when his vision for Wakanda takes a turn for the worse. The supporting male actors led by Forest Whittaker are fully formed individuals with their own stories that weave into the tapestry that is Wakanda.My favorite characters were the Dora Milaje. These fierce warriors are the body guards of the king. These characters were not based on myth. They actually have historic counterparts. The Mino were the all female regiment in what is not Benin. Westerners called them the Dahomey Amazons. And that's the other thing that the movie does. It gives us...all of us of African descent...something to be proud of besides animated lions and CGI gorillas. It allows us to be proud of the diversity of the Mother Continent without pandering or caricatures. This is not Congo, or Tarzan. The Africans are not bumbling sidekicks. They are front and center and they kick ass! The Dora Milaje have a vital part to play in the movie. They are not arm candy and need no one to rescue them. They are led by General Okoye portrayed by The Walking Dead's Dania Gurira. The Dora Milaje were introduced in Captain America: Civil War. Actress Florence Kasumba's one line (Move or you will be moved.) spoken with quiet authority piqued my interest. T'Challa's sister, Shuri, is a tech genius. She creates all his suits, weapons, gadgets and other items using the mineral vibranium that is only found in Wakanda. Angela Bassett is the queen mother.The action sequences are astounding. Ryan Coogler knows how to shoot action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The casino fight was awesome. Two women fought numerous assailants. It's the first time I've seen a wig used as a weapon. Although, to be fair, Okoye was tired of it before the butt kicking started.Black Panther has it all. There's humor, heartache, pathos, action, action, cool tech, warmth...something for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it on the big screen. You will not regret it. I'm going back to get another dose of all that Wakandan goodness. Join me."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is a solid portrayal of a deep comic book character and one of the better Marvel films, utilizing exciting direction from the always proficient Ryan Coogler and pronounced acting from Boseman, B. Jordan (the best in the film by far), Nyong'o, Serkis, and Gurira. My major cons with the film included the overuse of CGI and jump-cut action, both expected staples for modern Marvel films, alongside the 2+ hour run time felt which grew tedious by the third act. Definently worth the watch before Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,7/10,"Marvel has scored another hit at the box office, as well as among movie critics. I read some reviews before seeing the movie and was surprised at the wide range of ratings. Going in I was willing to give it a ""7"" going in, just because it is Marvel. I haven't seen a bad Marvel movie yet. Black Panther was no exception, yet it possessed a strange dualism. On the one hand, the movie was superbly made, cleverly written, possessing great cinematography, exciting special effects, top-notch acting by all the principals and several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. I would not be surprised if Black Panther received Oscar nominations for more than special effects.On the other side I felt, as a Conservative, that Coogler and Cole were intent on lecturing me from their Leftist-Globalist political ideology. There were subtle but obvious jabs at the Trump Administration. I suppose we should give T'Challa some slack since he is so new at governing. He (indeed the entire MCU) ignores the threat of Radical Islam and he hasn't considered what he would do if millions of illegal immigrants showed up at the gates of Wakanda for their slice of the pie. Killmonger did offer a valid reality check that as soon as the world became aware of Wakanda's scientific advancements, other powers would want to come and take it away from them.Wakanda, of course, is a fantasy. While it seeks to reflect African culture and succeeds in various ways, it fails to represent the diversity of the continent of Africa. Many times in the movie speech patterns, idiomatic expressions and mannerisms reflect black culture in America rather than Africa. One aspect that is accurate is inter-tribal competition, which in the history of Africa resulted in internecine warfare. Africans have not historically manifested the philosophy of ""one tribe."" ""White people"" are presented in the film as colonizers (which Everett Ross rejects), but ignored is the fact that Christian missionaries brought medicine, hospitals, schools and improved agriculture. Yes, white people engaged in the horrific slave trade, but conversely white people ended it. White people have given over and over for the good of Africa and Africa is the better for it.Frankly, I liked Black Panther better in Captain America: Civil War where he wasn't preaching at us. I wonder if he will try his Liberal ideology on Thanos. Nah. Thanos does not believe in sharing the wealth."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2019,5/10,It was OK. Not really worth the price of a theater ticket. Probably wouldn't watch it again...
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2021,6/10,"The storytelling is well-done, the visual effects are top-notch as well as the costume design! The acting was convincing and it was an all-in-all refreshing and entertaining offer from Marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 December 2018,1/10,I watched this at the theaters and glad to say i wasn't the only one sleeping sad to say but the movie did give me one of the best naps I've had in a long time..
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2020,7/10,"This movie has one of the best villains of Marvel. He is compelling, his morals are in check, and the hero even turns over to his side in the end. It has great performances, but the effects are perhaps the worst in any Marvel movie and it looked like a PS3 videogame at the end"
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,10/10,"I liked very much how African culture was represented (music, speech, folklore) and I am looking forward to see more movies of this type. All the cast and crew was great. Also, RIP Chadwick Boseman. Your were a good actor and you deserve to go in heaven with dignity."
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2018,8/10,"I really enjoyed this movie... it was well worth the price of the tickets.
It took me a few minutes to come down off the high from the graphics, story line, acting... everything!
I will be getting this one for my own personal movie collection and watch it a bunch times over!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 October 2018,1/10,The worst acting I've ever seen. It's like an Ed Wood movie without the charm.
BLACK PANTHER,14 July 2019,1/10,"Utter Garbage from the very poor CGI at times to the awful acting, were the official critics payed off?"
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2019,6/10,"""Black Panther"" relies on it's cool title character and somewhat interesting fight scenes in order to reach success.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The script is poorly written, simply put. The pacing is terrible and the story is uninteresting. Give it a few decades when Marvel has completely lost its control of the general populous, and nobody will be talking about this film. Its very foundation is problematic. It was supposed to be a fantastic film raising up Black Americans (and black culture in general). However, it made the main villain a Black American. This is a serious issue for a film that is supposed to be inclusive and bring people together. It does have a cast of mostly Black actors, which is fantastic, but as far as storytelling goes I think the Black community deserved a much better film. And Marvel fans in general deserved a better film. Ryan Coogler completely missed the mark on this one. *Cinematography/Editing: The film looks a little bit too digital, as do most Marvel films. This causes me to get taken out of the film a bit. It feels more like a video one would find on YouTube, and not a film coming from a massive studio. I'm not sure how much say cinematographer Rachel Morrison had over the look of the film, but it is not her best work. It all feels a little cheap and gimmicky. The editing is sub-par. Action sequences that are not CGI are full of quick cuts which doesn't allow us to see much action actually happening. There is one long-take fight scene but it looks very sloppy. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is incredibly lacking and cringe-worthy. Many lines produced a large number of eye rolls. ""What are those!?!"" comes to mind. The acting was less than impressive. Boseman doesn't have enough charisma to lead a film. Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman phone in their performances, as does Michael B. Jordan. Jordan's performance feels terribly flat and unemotional. The rest of the actors are not very talented. Although Forest Whitaker does relatively well for his part. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is fine, although I personally found it to be uninteresting and did not add much to the film. The Academy Award was grossly undeserved. The sound design was quite awful. Lots of cheap sounds and much of the film felt empty in terms of audio. *Production Design/Special Effects: Again, terrible decision by the Academy to award this film. The sets, costumes, and practical effects are not bad by any means, but they feel incredibly ordinary. They are not very dynamic or original. Many of the sets (especially CGI sets) felt incredibly bland and uninteresting to look at. As far as CGI, this film looked terrible and there is no getting around it.*Conclusion: ""Black Panther"" may be a decent film to pass the time if you want something to watch, but it is by no means life changing. It is one of the worst Marvel films and leaves much to be desired."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Amazing film! I don't really know the difference between DC and Marvel, so I don't have a bias there.This film was superb!!! This was the first time I was excited to see in film...in recent memory. I would recommend it to those who like action, those who like comics and to those who want to see African characters portrayed in a positive light...for once!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 August 2018,5/10,"The graphics were gorgeous but the dialog was very banal. I actual preferred Black Lightning the tv series for its richer characters. BTW, our guide pointed out that panthers are not indigenous to Africa, although Panthera Leo is the scientific name for the lion."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,2/10,"I will not go into what's wrong with the movie too much, because it's pretty much everything. The storyline is all over the place, the acting is very cringy at times and mediocre at best. There are some good actors involved but the overly faked African accent just ruins it for them. So here's the real problem, this movie gets an average critic score of 88. Which is very high I mean critic scores on IMDB are never that high, especially for an action movie like this. Then I got to thinking why is it so high? The movie is clearly not that good..Is it because critics are afraid to score this low because they will be labeled a racist because it's an all black movie? That's really the only reason I can think of. So hence the title, a bad movie got a good score because of the way the world works today. And that to me, is the sadest thing about it all. (I would score 1 out of 10 but I gave 2 because they had nice Lexus cars)"
BLACK PANTHER,11 November 2019,1/10,The worst movie Marvel has put out. It's just boring and a hour too long. I actually walk out of the theater.
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,7/10,"Good not great. I think it's over hyped. Yes the world set up is fun and visually pleasing. Unfortunately though it's your standard Marvel intro movie. Following similar tropes is to be expected, sure! But overall? I expected a game changer and it was purely by the numbers"
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,8/10,"Has to be the best film I've seen for several months - perhaps a year. Let's be honest this isn't a classic of the magnitude of ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Citizen Kane"" BUT it's good fun, fast paced, well acted, well filmed, well edited. I love that the two token white people were not American but British. It's refreshing to have a film which paints Africa in a positive light and where Africans - at least African Americans - are the focus. Well done!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Okay so people have giving me a hard time for not liking this movie. It's not that I didn't like. It was an OKAY marvel movie. Just not a lot really happens. The plot is dull and predictable. The hype made it seem like it was going to be the best Marvel movie ever. That is false in my opinion - Thor Ragnorok and Guardians 2 were by far the best so far - full of action, humor, and good stories. Black Panther movie does not even do much for the cinematic universe as it all takes place in Wakanda. The end credit scenes do tie it in but that's it really. PROS :
-Good action scenes 
-Black Panther's sister (she is my new hero)CONS :
-Too Long
-Dull Plot - almost predictable
-Too much hype
-Lame villian choice (really Michael B Jordan as a threat ? )"
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2019,5/10,"Black Panther (2018), directed by Ryan Coogler and produced by Kevin Fiege, is based on a Marvel Comic character with the same name. I saw many critics love this movie: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 88 points in Metacritic and a fair 7.3 from IMDb (I think that's too low, is it?). It also was one of the best MCU movies I've ever seen.
There was Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan was the main antagonist, Killmonger, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia and Winston Duke as M'Baku. They acted good on the movie making the characters unforgettable, usually making funny jokes and I laughed for some time. Killmonger almost topped the greatest villain in the MCU but no, there's a few ones which were better like Thanos, Ultron or even Loki. He's just number 4 on my list. He's pretty badass though and made a better villain than Ulysses Klaue.
The acting suited the plot really well, and the Black Panther comic was well-chosen for the plot of the movie making both audiences and critics love it. Everything was awesome there.
I definately loved the action sequences. They were really EPIC with some Wakandan technology, usually made from Vibranium (especially the Black Panther suit). There were explosions everywhere which made the battle look more like a war. Though I really didn't like one stupid decision done in here, and that is T'Challa's father, T'Chaka's fault for abandoning the child, Killmonger but then I understood without that stupid decision, there wouldn't be a great villain in here and the movie couldn't get any better without that kind of villain. The CGI was definately good. Without CGI, there wouldn't be Wakanda, no vibranium, no high-tech gears and it may be the worst of MCU if they don't have CGI.
One of the best things about Black Panther was the Original Score. Thanks to Ludwig Goransson, we couldn't have a great Black Panther movie without him and he impressively deserved an Oscar for Best Original Score. The soundtrack made us feel about Wakanda, all its technology and the score was also suitable for the movie because of its Africaness (I made up that word Lol).
I would say that Black Panther's highly rated by audiences and critics for its role-credits and movie editings. They worked really hard for the movie and it was nominated for Oscars' Best Picture. In my opinion, Black Panther's one of the greatest MCU movies and it also deserved a high rating from me.
Points: 9.1/10"
BLACK PANTHER,17 September 2020,9/10,"I'm not gonna lie. According to me, this is the best single superhero Marvel movie till date. This movie is serious and have little less humour compared to other Marvel movies. That's why most of the audience is little disappointed.
The African culture is shown beautifully in the movie. Action sequences are also good. Ryan Coogler has done great job in directing this film. Overall it's a worth watching movie.
Rest in Peace Chadwick Boseman.
Wakanda Forever"
BLACK PANTHER,25 July 2020,,"Yikes. Compare the VFX in this to the VFX of Venom, then go look at the reviews between the two and tell me that racism wasn't involved. A lot of fragile viewers just don't like that a strong cast of black people made their own superhero movie.Yes, the VFX has some weak moments, but overall there isn't anything more ""recycled"" here than there is in any other superhero movie.It's very good. Not 10/10 good, but anything to offset the losers who not only felt obliged to write their empty opinions of this movie, but also downvote all of the positive reviews beyond the negative ones."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"This movie is a counterpoint to Thor: Ragnarok in the MCU. It's basically the same plot: a new king must secure his succession to the throne, and must fight challengers along the way. But when Thor is light and funny (and excellent in that regard), Black Panther is serious and surprisingly tragic. In each moment in this movie, the stakes are high, and the marvelous cinematography and incredible music are great to introduce us in the kingdom of Wakanda, and its magical ways and exotic costumes. As a superhero movie, it's more deep, tragic and reflexive than usual. Really the characters are forced to face difficult questions, which the audience will find in a real moral dilemma to answer. This is not just the case of a stock villain trying to ""take over whatever"". There is a deep context in all the decisions the characters must face, and the movie is not trying to evade any of those questions.Thor: Ragnarok was a celebration of fun and good times in a superhero movie. Black Panther was a reflexive introspection of the themes of supeheroes and violence. Both movies excelled in their settings, so both movies deserve the ""really remarkable"" score.10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,10/10,"""Black Panther"" is one of the best films of the year in my opinion! The all-star cast is superb and Chadwick Boseman is the perfect fit for the role of T'Challa, otherwise known as the ""Black Panther."" The film itself is also visually stunning as well. Aside from tackling real world issues that relate to oppression, the film also follows T'Challa as he works his way to the throne in a fictional third world country known as ""Wakanda"" which is based in Africa. Meanwhile, he also works with CIA agent Everett Ross and a few of his natives to try and stop the villainous Ulysses Klaue from stealing any more Vibranium whilst trying to get an ancient artifact back from him that Klaue and his thugs stole from a British museum earlier in the film.Klaue ends up ultimately betrayed and murdered by Erik Killmonger, son of N'Jobu, so that he (Erik) could challenge T'Challa for the throne back in Wakanda. Killmonger ends up defeating T'Challa and throws him down a waterfall. Fearing that T'Challa has died, the natives of Wakanda reluctantly crown Killmonger as their new king. Killmonger's reign is short lived, though, as we find out later in the film that T'Challa has been saved by one of his natives. Later in the film, we see that T'Challa is mostly covered in a snow / ice like material and it is this material that revives him. T'Challa and some of his natives then develop a plan to overthrow Killmonger. A massive battle commences and this puts both T'Challa and some of his natives briefly at odds with one another as who to protect and who to defend since Killmonger was just crowned the new king of Wakanda. Quickly seeing Killmonger as ""too hateful"" however the natives eventually turn on him and start defending T'Challa once again. Killmonger later dies in front of T'Challa. T'Challa himself is then rightfully reinstated as king of Wakanda. Just as the film ends, we see that T'Challa is in California with one of his natives. They are standing in front of the same building that his father and uncle were once in (it's basically like an apartment complex and was featured in the beginning of the film). T'Challa then mentions that has plans to turn it into a wellness center for Wakanda natives. The film itself then draws to a close shortly after that. Lastly, Bucky Barnes from the Avengers is also shown at the very end credits sequence and is referred to as the ""White Wolf."" Stan Lee also has his traditional cameo in this film as well. In summary, this is a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone. Once this releases to Blu-Ray, I will definitely be picking it up! No matter if you're a fan of the Marvel films or not, this film is definitely worth your time and money!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2019,4/10,"Late to the party, I watched this Best Picture contender on dvd, which means that a lot of the visual WOWness went to waste. Knowing that I still say that the overall image quality was bland, impressive only when presenting some great visions such as Wakanda city.Not being overwhelmed by the visual bombardment, it was easier to focus on what was actually said and what was actually happening. And I was disappointed. Interesting social commentary went largely undeveloped. Content-WISE, ""Black Panther"" is a kid's movie, and not particalularly refined at that. Dialogue was stock and characters largely cardboard.I was very disappointed, to my surprise, of the cast. Chadwick Boseman, in particular. He is a tremendously gifted actor, but took T'Challa so seriously, that it became stilted. His slow reading of the lines alone made any resonance on the comical register impossible. Michael B. Jordan fared much better, but the character motivations for him were a bit confusing. Andy Serkis did a very good job with his ridiculous character. In the end, Martin Freeman was for the umpteenth time the best actor in a movie he appears in, without really getting his due share of the raves.Coogler directs fluently, but, for example, the inauguration challenge fight was noticeably clunky. Also, this being a Marvel movie, most of what you see on the screen is actually CGI, or CGI enhanced (those rhinos really don't work). So you're watching an animation, basically. And it doesn't look that good. And, this being a Disney production, the lack of blood is incredible. There is a scene, where a person's throat is slit with a sword, and not a drop of blood is seen. If you can't show blood, don't shoot such scenes.I honestly don't quite know what to say about ""Black Panther"", I was so much anticipating a better and more different movie. ""BlacKKKlansman"" is a far, far better movie about similar themes. ""Black Panther"" needed a more experienced filmmaker to pull it through."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2021,3/10,"I think we know why this movie got it's high ratings but this was a major disappointment to me. I saw this movie once and was immediately bored and doing other stuff, so I gave it another try and it got my full attention.I like Boseman in general (RIP,) and had high hopes after Civil War when his character was intro'd and was really good. I mean if this was just another movie and not part of the MCU, I highly doubt it gets such great reviews and racks up as much money!The soundtrack was great and of course the graphics. Some of the fight scenes were good but actually not all, especially the end fight! I've seen reviews saying Killmonger is the best villain of all time in the MCU, are you frigging kidding me! His whole backstory is almost the same as Whiplash in Iron Man 2! And in the times we're in now, it's scary to think just how many people think exactly like him. The movie all around was very slow and unlike a lot of other MCU movies, it really acted on it's own and I actually like it when they tie other characters and stories to it (Winter Soldier end-credit doesn't count.) The political stance was not needed as well.So it gets a 3 probably for posthumous honor for Boseman, the Soundtrack, and being in the MCU in general"
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is one of the decent Marvel movies and I easily give it a 7 but that is a 7 that heavily leans on 6.
I think that the problem is the hype that was around this movie and how among some this title has become untouchable and if you show anything other than enthusiasm you are called some really nasty stuff.
However this film is not bad, or good, it is just decent.
I personally expected much more out of Chadwick Boseman in this film considering his prior films however it is unfortunate to see him almost devoid of all charisma and charm, the main villain Michael B Jordan is just really good in this film and made Chadwick look pretty weak in comparison as an actor, but in reality Michael was not the only one that was considerably more entertaining to watch than Chadwick in Black Panther.
The sound design is pretty good but the script needed more ironing out as it had a fair amount of lazy writing issues.
Another problem in my eyes is the special effects specially the CGI in the movie were pretty low quality in several places.
All in all I would give this movie a 7 mainly because of how good Miachael B Jordan was as Killmonger."
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,8/10,"Marvel seldom puts out bad films and as far as stand-alone features go, this is probably one of the best they have put out in a while. The film does a marvellous job bringing to life the fictional world of Wakandla, having put thought into every little detail and fans of the 'Black Panther' series of comics (which I am) will be thrilled; in ways of set work and art direction, I'll say this is Marvel's golden achievement. Casting is great as well with Chadwick Boseman returning to the screen as the titular 'Black Panther' or King T'Challa, after first being introduced in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', Chadwick was born to play this part, bringing heart to his character, facing a constant inner battle between his loyalties to his kingdom and his moral obligations to an outside world less fortunate. Side characters do a great job too, especially Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The sibling chemistry between these two characters are off the chart and is an actual true highlight of this film, you completely buy them as brother and sister, constantly on each other's cases, but: should anyone else dare... Both the main antagonists in this film do a great job as well, and that was quite refreshing too, as one place Marvel often has fallen short was in creating memorable villains. Michael B. Jordan stars as Erik Killmonger and Andy Serkis (for once not just appearing as a CGI character) as Ulysses Klaue; Jordan plays his character more straight, assassin like, but sells it well, creating sympathy and even some understanding for what we know is a truly evil character, Serkis takes a more comedic approach, basically playing the character as a fat South African who had one too many beers; both characters are completely different and sets two different tones for the film that actually makes the pacing work brilliantly as we switch over from the second to third act. Lastly I just want to make mention of the action as, after all, that is still why many people see these films: the action sequences in this film is great, but actually has it's best moments in the one-on-one battles when T'Challa has to defend his crown in tribal rituals. The fights are intense and beautifully choreographed. Really, there is nothing I can truly fault 'Black Panther' on; even somebody like me, who will openly admit that I have started finding the ever growing super hero genre to have become somewhat trying, will admit that this is about as fresh a film that has come from this genre since the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and it is most certainly a film I will happily recommend you go see on the big screen."
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2018,,"All these critical reviews... Sometimes you just have to let all that go and enjoy the ride.This film, however, is a derivative of Avatar. Same exact premise."
BLACK PANTHER,4 April 2018,6/10,"Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler is Marvel's latest film, and is marketed as being a unique take on the cinematic universe. And to a certain extent it is, in terms of setting and characters. But ultimately the action set pieces and story structure is basically exactly what we would expect. Black Panther sadly has many issues in my opinion. Firstly the pacing is slow and ultimately boring. The endless expository dialogue cannot be justified as something that is necessary for character development. In fact the characters were my second major issue. Killmonger's revenge story doesn't even pick up until halfway through the film. Yes they gave him a back story, but it's so basic I could describe it all in a sentence. His lack of development made it really hard to care in crucial moments, such as the climatic battle which didn't feel climatic due to the lack of emotional attachment I had to the characters. I never felt an authentic connection to the story because all we are given for our villain were forced emotional flashbacks. Furthermore, for a film with a $200 million budget the level of CGI was pretty unacceptable. It wasn't unbearable, but for the most part every CGI aspect was noticeably CGI. The animated scenery of Wakanda didn't blow me away in the slightest. The comedy in the film was so weak. Every joke was completely out of place. The film seemed scared to let scenes build in intensity. We didn't need a dumb joke about vegetarians to mess up the tone. Another issue was the lack of suspense and anticipation I felt throughout the entire runtime. Any life threatening scene for T'Challa became incredibly dull with zero emotional impact simply because I had just seen him in the Avenger's trailer literally right before the movie started. All in all, Black Panther is a perfectly enjoyable action film and I'm glad so many people felt satisfied by it. The movie presents such important ideas surrounding social justice and racial equality, although putting that aside and looking at the film I was very disappointed. By the end it was so predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in. So therefore I give Black Panther a"
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,9/10,"Marvel's latest entry in their ever-expanding cinematic universe follows directly after Captain America: Civil War, with Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa, a.k.a., Black Panther, preparing to take the throne of Wakanda after his father's tragic death. Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (and Joe Robert Cole), who is on a real hot streak after Fruitvale Station and Creed, Black Panther is the first superhero/comic book movie to feature a black lead since the Blade series (1998, 2002 & 2004), but more than that, this is a distinctively African story with a predominantly black cast. Something that's equally unique for a franchise film and a tentpole movie that's leading into Avengers: Infinity War. Whether Black Panther will prove to be significant enough to encourage more faith in diverse casts within the industry and audiences at large is yet to be seen, but I've every confidence that this will be a very popular and successful film. And it deserves to be. Black Panther is really terrific. Importantly, to some degree, Black Panther also works as a stand-alone film, being quite self-contained despite being part of a bigger world. Much like Wakanda, which is almost akin to an African Brigadoon; a place hidden in the jungle, unknown to outsiders, unseen, but magical within. This Utopia has been built on a rare metal that is more technologically advanced than anything else on earth, whilst a certain plant unique to the land is key to the royal bloodline and the power of Black Panther. This is a beautifully realised film, with a real cultural sensibility with a true identity established for Wakanda and its inhabitants. Every scene is brought vividly to life, from tribal rituals on the top of a waterfall to a city infrastructure, throne rooms and tech centres, and a nice diversion to Busan, where one of the film's villains, Andy Serkis' Klaue is being pursued. What's also evident is the enjoyment and commitment a truly excellent cast displays throughout. From Boseman, who plays T'Challa as an intelligent, sensitive, proud man, to a fierce Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyonga on assertive form, and a sparkling performance from Letitia Wright, who, is both T'Challa's sister and a Q-like master of arms and tech specialist. With palace intrigue abound, Black Panther finds ways to make T'Challa truly reflect his culture, which goes some way to counterbalance some of the typical - perhaps even expected - superhero movie tropes; absent fathers, flying machines, special costumes and a major battle at the climax. With the battle in question finding a different approach to the city under siege narrative that's been overdone in terms of mass destruction. There's strong support from Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Angela Bassett. Distinctive costume design, great music and a fine score. Plus well-paced moments of humour in a film that's smart, self-aware, ambitious enough to be individual within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a real pleasure from start to finish."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"There are some movies than mean more than just entertainment or insight in ones life. There are certain films that spark phenomenons for certain cultures in unexplainable ways while still maintaining the intent for enjoyment for others. Black Panther emerged from the Captain America: Civil War film and gave the audience only a feeling of what to expect from the land of Wakanda, but also brought the audience even more than one would expect from a Marvel movie.The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) as he takes the throne as king of Wakanda after the death of his father. As he returns home and settling within his position, he also comes across people who challenge his abilities as a king and the sins of his fathers past.Ryan Coogler as a director really delivers a gorgeous movie (his third film so far, Creed & Fruitvale Station) and stage Wakanda beautifully from the world building to the eclectic costume design. The characters motivations feel sharper than ever, and never fears making references that make the audiences laugh and snap their fingers. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is one of the few MCU villains that has a believable motivation but a shockingly raw reason to his plan that many might find themselves asking the same thing.While the cinematography can be really good at times, it can be shaky at moments as well. The very first fight scene takes place in the dark, and with the gunfire and fast cutting, it can be a little shaky on the eyes at times deciphering whats happening. Also the CGI in some points, particularly in a ""Coming to America"" style christening, I felt a little deja vu from old cutout characters from old video games. And while there's more than enough action to spare in this film, I could have used a little bit of space in between each action scene.Black Panther nonetheless is still a very rousing kind of superhero movie that takes on a couple interesting themes. There's excitement, and really challenges the power dynamic when the shoe is on the other foot. Find the biggest screen you can and be ready to take a trip that you may not want to come back from."
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,1/10,Now I don't wanna seem racist tho I live in America so I'm very likely to be one but this should have gone straight to BET. Not only that but these were the very worst actors. The only one that has any on screen presence is Michael B Jordan and he was only in it for like 2 minutes. They need to stop making marvel movies. These get worse and worse and I must blame all of you because you keep paying for this garbage
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"TL;DR
Stunning aestheticsCommitment to African culture and Afrofuturism is wonderful with terrific resultsA very colourful filmA refreshingly different feel for a superhero filmExciting, fast-paced and varied actionAs much comedy as you'd hope from a Marvel movieGreat performances with a strong supporting cast and one of Marvel's most compelling villainsBlack Panther is a special film in a number of ways. Not only is it the 18th Marvel film and the last one before the big third outing for the Avengers, but it's big for black culture and Afrofuturism, being the first big blockbuster superhero film featuring a black lead and, more importantly, a nearly all black cast (and crew). It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,,"4/4Every aspect of this film was absolutely spectacular. This is not only one of the absolute best superhero movies of all time, this is Marvel expanding it's audience beyond movie and comic-book enthusiasts. It is also catering to the African-American community. And seriously, I think we can all agree that it was about time for a black superhero. Am I right?Chadwick Boseman delivers a very convincing performance as T'Challa, never once was I in doubt of the native-African accent. Another MCU trademark (a good amount of movies can't seem to do this), the lead actor is truly the best actor. Also, they have a Grade-A director that brings out the performances tenfold. The one overall thing I felt lacking in this movie was the signature wit I've come to expect in a Marvel movie. The few jokes seemed to miss fire more than make contact, which is unfortunate, because the movie was so good otherwise.As far as the cinematography goes, it is the most color filled eye candy around. The special effects are the Segway to the plot. The colors have a realistic feel with a slightly surreal and other-worldly tint (Well after all, Wakunda is another world) It's an absolutely beautiful film.
However, the way they shot the beginning sequence in Oakland was irritating. It was a low-light rapid transition hat I totally missed into the jungles of Africa. However, it was revealed later through a flashback exactly what happened.The soundtrack is another revolution. Everything from genuine African vibes to compliment Wakunda and ""the challenges"", to The Weeknd for when T'Challa travels to Bangkok. Kendrick Lamar takes the mic in Oakland and teams up with SZA for a more poppy song in the credits. Flawless.In conclusion, this movie has an obviously presented message that doesn't dilute the movie. It's a movie about power... but it isn't. It's a film about people of different backgrounds pulling their talents together for the betterment of our world (as evidenced in the final cut scene in the credits). It's worth the $16 to see in the theatre, and they can count on me spending $30 more for the Blu-Ray/Digital Deluxe Combo Pack."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,6/10,"I can't say i loved it, but i did like it. A good ""Spin Off"" movie to a character who has an amazing back story and now has officially entered the Marvel Universe. The visual effects were good, fighting scenes weren't the best. The two best highlights were the performances of villain Michael B. Jordan and the surprise cameo of Martin Freeman (During the movie i kept quoting the office in my head)"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2019,10/10,"Black Panther My Review
(10/10)
This is by far the best Marvel movie ever. Impressively well-acted film. The difference with ""Black Panther"" is that, while observing the outlines of the traditional comic book arc, Coogler and his creative team have enlarged and revitalized it.
Drawing on elements from African history and tribal culture, as well as contemporary and forward-looking flourishes, ""Black Panther"" pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty, from the beadwork and textiles of spectacular costumes and warm, dazzlingly eye-catching production design to hairstyles, tattoos and scarifications that feel both ancient and novel.
The MCU not only needed this movie, but all of the United States needed this movie. For a superhero movie, ""Black Panther"" exceeds exceptions and is sure to leave its impact of being one of the best in its genre. Socially aware, aesthetically captivating and emotionally pulling, this movie is one that is sure to leave its mark as one of the best superhero movies of recent memory."
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2018,3/10,"Lots of action, but a lack of any serious depth to the plot. It's actually a simplistic plot. It's somewhat ironic that Wakanda is presented as the most advanced culture on Earth. But this ""advanced"" culture chooses its leader by ritual combat to the the death. That's hardly advanced or civilized. Such a nation would have inevitably descended into tyranny and war if their leaders were chosen this way. And that is what happens in the movie. There was such a tremendous amount of hype to this movie- perhaps more hype than for any movie before in history. The movie doesn't live up to the hype. Not even close. The CGI wasn't even that good. Some of the gushing reviews by ""professional"" critics were unbelievable. Were we watching the same movie? It's as if they felt obligated to love the movie because a lot of black people were in it. Over-all this is a movie that will enthrall children and people with the minds of children. Intelligent adults won't think that much of it. Many of them will lose track of what is happening fairly quickly. And not really care. After all, it's eye candy for the kids. So who cares if it lacks a serious plot?"
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,8/10,"As a self proclaimed movie buff I feel a little embarrassed to say that this was my first time ever watching a Marvel Motion picture. I have watched the Marvel shows on Netflix but nothing else. My initial thoughts are what a marvelous movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did. The more you get into this film, the better it gets. The beginning 1/3 of this movie was a bit generic, it seemed pretty ordinary until then but as soon as you get into the second half of this film the plot thickens and you are hooked. It had depth, it has dimension. It has a great message behind it. I loved the characters, the cinematography was amazing. This is a great film to watch if you're a sucker for science fiction and a bit of soul in it. Brilliant!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 June 2020,6/10,"Black Panther is smarter than the average superhero movie, though that's not saying much. Just when you think this might be an intriguing movie there is a deus ex machina moment, plot convenience, or a really over-long CGI fight scene to remind you that this is simply another Marvel movie sliding off the conveyor belt. The ending speech that re-explains the plot is especially annoying.There's a lot of inconsistencies. The suit can absorb a grenade with no noticeable impact yet he is blasted back by an RPG ten seconds later. Also for some reason the suit can redirect damage some moments but not others. Chalk that up to ""plot armor"" I guess.In or out of the suit he is impervious, which leads to the major problem with Black Panther: the main character. He has no arc and has no flaws, unless you count being too humble and trusting. It's an incredibly boring character. I was actually rooting for the bad guy if only to make the film interesting. This is one of those weird films where the bad guys all have more personality and complex motivations than the good guys.The royal family for first half of this movie is smug and unbearable, and for the second half are hypocrites defending a system they suddenly realize is horribly flawed, but only when it disadvantages them. But that is never explored. Their main motivation is revenge and to usurp the throne for the sake of ruling...exactly the motivation of the bad guy, except he actually has a nuanced backstory, charisma, and a philosophy he wants to put into practice."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Remove the social/political context within the film and it still shines through as an extremely well acted beautiful film from the costumes to the cinematography. Add the necessary social/political context and it becomes a film much needed for many reasons. Easily one of the best Marvel films I've seen and possibly sits at the top for above mentioned reasons. Weakest parts of the film were a couple of minor CGI action sequences and the unnecessary Martin Freeman character. Strongest parts was the rest of the action throughout, a fantastic cast who acted their roles perfectly and the solid storytelling. An excellent film from the combination of directing, writing, acting and special effects."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,7/10,"The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.The action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. While the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. In fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.The story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. This is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. In addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. Despite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.The movie does ask some thought provoking questions, but they're really not pursued. The one consequence shown in the movie isn't so much related to the questions the movie asks, but it is the result of a singular poor decision unrelated to the social and economic questions the movie asks."
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,8/10,"Introducing the newest member of the avengers roster, teaming up with some heroes, we watch the black panther.
Through all the expectations to the all the facts after seeing the movie, it all leads to the conclusion that Marvel didn't want to make their tipycal variant of the good ordered blockbuster, but give a chance for something else, so the people could see other new members of the crew of Marvel.
Well, that ended pretty well with the high ratings and box office.
Some people find it great and awesome. Others find it worst movie of Marvel.
I have other opinion. It is good. But it is not great. To make more simple to think it:
The story and all the acting and assembling the whole pieces of the movie producing and filming is all top. But in the final, maybe even in the early too, phase of the making of the movie, seem to be mistakes, which do not blow everything up fortunately. The montage and some of the scenes, were awfully cut or placed. This kinda takes part of the enjoy of the film. And that's what is weird for the Marvel movies. They always are well planned and carefully made untill the final realease.
But this does not make any troubles, because I'm sure Marvel had that plan. And they do not find those mistakes fatal. The phase is completed, and they are ready to get back on track for perfection."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"I went into BLACK PANTHER with high expectations and looking forward to a fresh and exciting new MCU franchise and for most of the film that was what I got. BLACK PANTHER began as a fun, new, superhero adventure romp with good acting, a fairly decent plot and brilliant visuals. Director Ryan Coogler, for the story of BLACK PANTHER has combined the old, tribal customs of Africa with fresh, new, brilliant technology and a mother load of vibraniam to create a fascinating MCU world. Wakanda is an amazingly colourful world brought to life with the great visual effects and natural scenery. It's looks almost like an African version of Coruscant from STAR WARS. The casting for the most part in this film is brilliant and almost every member is on great form and doing their uttermost. Boseman is obviously the main highlight in this film and gives a very convincing performance as T'Challa. We only caught a small glimpse of his true talent as Black Panther in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film we get a much more thorough and fascinating look at the character with Boseman playing all his characteristics and emotions brilliantly and becoming a real hero we can care about. He's brilliantly complex and multi-layered and a very fun character to spend time with. The rest of the cast is on top form with the likes of Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and several others. They gave real life to the characters and made them fun and interesting. There was one rather silly performance: Michael B. Jordan as the movie's main villain Erik Killmonger. It's not really his fault, it's more the writing. Killmonger as a character and as a villain is completely bland and two-dimensional. Jordan tries his best to save the role and make it convincing, but turns the part into more of a shouting act. On the other hand, it's disappointing that the great Andy Serkis is only made a MINOR villain as Ulysses Klaue. His character is dynamic, fun and really pops so it's a shame that he's ""offed"" so early.Now, onto one of the good things but also the problem of this film: the plot. To start, it's fun, action-packed and very entertaining. Coogler choreographs really brilliant action scenes that feel almost like something out of THE MATRIX at some points. It's a great ride with fairly fun characters and that's all great until we get into the 3rd ACT. The finale is possibly one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen and takes a real dump on the whole movie! It's so lazy and stupid and goes WAY beyond the far-fetched antics of the beginning with laser ships, giant rhinos and a VERY disappointing sci-fi battle on the planes. I'm not just saying this because it's set in Africa and involves big cats but the ending is THE LION KING on acid and not in a good way. The whole final battle revolves around Killmonger's plan and it's just SO silly and pointless and frankly something one would expect from the Red Skull. Danai Gurira as Okoye leads her warriors against the villains on the plains and it quickly turns into pure spear porn. The sins of this ending were just SO terrible and it was impossible to overlook them, and this sadly dragged the film down terribly and made it a convoluted, silly, sci-fi mishmash that ruined a perfectly good movie premise. This was a real disappointment when I had such hopes for this movie and had enjoyed it so far.Here's what I say: enjoy Black Panther's role in CIVIL WAR and leave it at that!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,5/10,"There are things we know.¬∞ The technologically advanced show their power by fighting. (Though really their most impressive feat is containing a rhinoceros in a rickety wood rail fence.)¬∞ Powerful female warriors are all tall, thin, striking, and beautifully dressed.¬∞ Bullets bounce off magic unitards. (Of course we've known this since the first Superman comics were printed. Well, I guess I didn't know it quite that far back, since that was before I was born back in the Middle Ages.)I understand why it was popular: the social shift, whose importance I don't dispute. But otherwise I saw little to recommend it; that social shift deserves better -- deserves real characters and drama, not poor comics. At least a third of the movie is spent in fights (seemed like more ... they felt interminable), which drew far more on CGI than on choreography. The plot is shallow and uninventive. Yes, few things in art are truly new, but this hardly has any new slants. I look at the long list of quotes from the movie on IMDb and don't see a single one that I'd call interesting.Stereotypes abound (see above) -- I've probably forgotten some in the days since I saw it. Vibranium bears an eerie resemblance to the magic lozenge that W S Gilbert wanted to use as a plot device and which his equally famous collaborator rejected. I found it insulting that Wakandans' success was basically credited to an accident of place rather than to their skills and ingenuity.In stories *about* the movie, much is made of African tribes, African history. I did not sense much of that in the actual movie though. Mostly lots of fights and individual posturing. Very little sense of any community. To the extent that tribal customs and dress were represented, they were so subsumed to the action as to be no more than background, and obscured background at that.Oh, Africa? AFAICT, not a single frame was shot in Africa. Studio work was all done in or near Atlanta GA. The ""British museum"" scene was shot in the High Museum in Atlanta, and the ""Oakland"" basketball court was in Atlanta. They went to the expense and logistics of spending a lot of time filming in South Korea -- scenes which were almost entirely fights. The dramatic waterfall, scene of fights that seem to go on forever, is in Argentina. Africa is represented by three continents, but Africa is not one of them.The soundtrack is resolutely late Romantic European style, with a few splashes of late 20th century American popular and general movie-score music. If there's anything in it that sounds African, I don't recall it, and don't hear it in the soundtrack sampler on IMDb. Isle of Dogs has more that sounds African. (The soundtrack sampler seems to consist only of the parts by Ludwig G√∂ransson, and there are other soundtrack credits, so perhaps some are more apt. I do hear a bit of kalimba in one of the G√∂ransson samples ... but the string orchestra accompaniment wipes out the African effect.)OK, it was a superhero movie. I don't watch those -- this was my first ever -- so I didn't really expect much. It lived up to my low expectations but did not exceed them. I don't doubt that (as widely reviewed) it's better than all the other superhero movies, but that's a low hurdle in my book. I recognize that the black cast is an important innovation in this genre and understand why that excited many people, but the genre lags movies in general. I won't say I was bored during it, but in looking back, I'd rather I had spent my time watching something else."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Like most movies, there are plenty of things to like about Black Panther, and plenty of things to dislike.LIKE:
1. It's Marvel. Even a middling MCU venture is still worth the price of admission.
2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The ""Q"" of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it, if and when you have the time. Just bear in mind it's nowhere as good as the public was led to believe."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,2/10,"After three attempts of watching this movie, i could not get past 40 minutes, it's just bad movie. Total waste of CGI"
BLACK PANTHER,4 January 2019,1/10,"This movie was so boring and drawn out I couldn't get through half of it. I tried twice, because I kept hearing people on tv say it was so good. I thought I would get used to the Jamaican accent, like I did with Braveheart 's accent after a while, but it was just horrific."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is your average superhero movie with the mainly black cast being the only risk taken.1. Standard high energy visuals with a mildly creative twist
2. Some incredibly predictable plot devices, most notably a) hero falls off a cliff into a river and doesn't die - epic comeback to follow and b) powerful group refuses to help and then shows up in the final battle to save the day
3. Poorly developed, almost placeholder romantic relationships
4. Black and white (forgive the pun) bad guys with the depth of tissue paperSad really because lurking just a few adventurous decisions away was one of the great superhero movies of all time.Enjoyable but ultimately too safe."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Amazing movie. Contains great fight scenes. Cool special effects. Great character development and casting. This is one of the best Marvel films and my second favorite after Thor Ragnarok.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,I loved this movie. Nice Visual Effects and CGI. It was the best Marvel movie I had seen along with Thor:Ragnarok. Why the hate? The film had a great plot and nice character development. It was great to have a real superhero in action. Well done Chadwick Boseman for being Black Panther.WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!
BLACK PANTHER,8 June 2021,9/10,"After a folktale-like prologue that recounts the history of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, BLACK PANTHER opens with a flashback to 1992, when a younger T'Chaka (Atandwa Kani) makes a surprise visit to Oakland, California, to confront a rogue Wakandan spy. Back in the present, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is preparing for his coronation day, which includes a potential challenge -- through ritual combat -- from any of Wakanda's five tribes, as well as a sacred ceremony in which he officially becomes the nation's Black Panther. After T'Challa takes the throne, intelligence surfaces that notorious arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) has stolen a vibranium artifact from the British Museum. T'Challa takes his top warrior -- head of the royal guard General Okoye (Danai Gurira) -- and his former love, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), a Wakandan spy, to attempt to capture Klaue (one of the few outsiders who knows the truth about how much vibranium -- the most valuable metal on Earth -- is available in Wakanda). But CIA operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and Klaue's mysterious young ally (Michael B. Jordan) complicate the mission. It turns out that the mystery man is a former SEAL who has a very personal score to settle with T'Challa and the Wakandans.Ryan Coogler's masterful superhero drama is unlike any other, featuring outstanding acting, breathtaking art direction, fascinating royal intrigue, memorable action sequences, and surprising depth. It's that depth -- of character, of storyline, of relevancy -- that makes Black Panther shine, as Boseman's T'Challa takes the mantle of king with enormous uncertainty about whether to share Wakanda's resources with the world. With the exception of his second-in-command W'Kabi (Kaluuya), T'Challa surrounds himself with an inner circle of influential women: Okoye, Nakia, his mother (Bassett), and his genius younger sister, scientist/tech inventor Shuri (Letitia Wright). Each of them contributes much to the story, with Gurira's spear-wielding Okoye the movie's clear scene-stealer, Wright the clever comic relief, and Nyong'o offering a wee bit of romance. Even the central villain, as played by frequent Coogler collaborator Jordan, is well-rounded and humanized, with the actor doing great work opposite the equally nuanced Boseman.There's so much to appreciate in Black Panther, from its pulsing score, which features a soundtrack overseen by award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar, to the mesmerizing cinematography courtesy of DP Rachel Morrison, gorgeous tribal costumes, and vibrant production design. There's not as much laugh-aloud banter as viewers may have come to expect from Marvel movies, but the beats of humor that are here, usually thanks to plucky Shuri or mountain-tribe leader M'Baku (Winston Duke), are extra funny. Ultimately the film's success comes down to the thoughtful, compelling storytelling from director Coogler and writer Joe Robert Cole, as interpreted by a terrific cast of actors. This isn't just another highly entertaining but formulaic superhero story; it's also poignant and powerful and earns its place toward the top of Marvel's films. (Be sure to watch all the way through the credits for a couple of extra tidbits!)"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"It seems that critics just love to throw big numbers to every superhero films last year. Logan, just a sad film with a way more interesting characters. everybody's getting old and dying. overall, a slighly above average superhero film. Wonder Woman, same case. interesting background story, but i was wishing more, more complexity that could have been showcased because the character was interesting enough. Thor: Ragnarok, i felt like i was watching different film. the whole film seems like a parody of the previous installments, which means a parody of bad films. And now, Black Panther. I'm not saying that this film is far from cheese and cheap thrill, and i'm not saying that the plot has improved from any other hollywood or superhero films. The film is a perfect marriage between great concept and great value.the background story of the film is more interesting than most of MCU films or story. one of the villain said that Wakanda is the real El Dorado. it is, but the place were kept by people with higher moral value and great understanding of virtue. They were not only deserve to keep the treasure and knowledge from the land, but also protect it from bad people. they were not drowned in it but maintaining it. their leader is the main character, the Black Panther.the film has two villain. the first one is a colonial type that seek power and fortune for himself. and the second one is more complex than the first one. he's a very angry person, and for reasons, has the right to be. his actions was very logic and has a great purpose. but what is a great purpose if you have a better one. that's the Wakanda people's code of ethic. peace. the value of philosopher. no wonder that they got to rule that El Dorado.there are several MCU films that i liked, the others i disliked, and Three that i loved. they are:
Iron Man. great plot and a superb characterCaptain America: Civil War, Epic sequences and a great story, also a beautiful tragedyBlack Panther: great concept and great moral valueand i'm hoping there will be others to follow"
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2019,7/10,"This movie was really enjoyable first and foremost. I finished watching it with a feeling of ""wow this was awesome"".
The CGI was pretty, the world crafted with it compelling and nice, the characters all had depth and somewhat of an arc. It took care to be generally enjoyable for everyone no matter which characters you found most interesting and nice.
This would easily have been a 9/10 despite the somewhat corporate overpolished aspect of things.However there were some glaring problems:
-Without spoiling anything the climactic fight scene is .... very lackluster, as others have pointed out. Fields and a cheaply rendered underground place? Did the CGI budget run out?
-Connected to this and all major fight scenes, while some african style music was included in other places, the fight scenes sorely acked them. Some unique music in those places could have enhanced this whole thing massively, but instead we just got the same old orchestral stuff, instead of some wakandan music enhanced.
-On the other side of things the whole white man as ""colonizers"" thing has been pushed a bit too much and it's incredibly cringe-y.
-Furthermore like with all avengers movies the good guys kill too many people. Additionally in this one they are defending a government style which - while admittedly it has worked for them - is really really nonsensical.So all in all a nigh perfect movie hampered by blunders that are too big to ignore."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,1/10,"...because this is exactly the case when you need precisely ZERO stars. There is no story in this ""movie"". Nada. Acting? Remember your congested nose from a cold, allergy, sinus infectio etc etc, when you have anosmia? That feeling of frustration when you can't enjoy your favorite dish because you can't really smell or taste it? Similar feeling from the ""acting"" in this ""movie"". 
Yeah, well...CGI. But you can't really entertain anyone nowadays with abundance of CGI. Total insult of the viewers. Absolute boring, bleak failure."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,3/10,"I am addicted to movies and the truth is I will normally find something good in almost any of them, but this one we could not even finish watching. It was just boring.
My wife is haitian and when i asked her if she wanted to see the rest of the movie she replied with a definitive ""No"".
Boring."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,6/10,"I went into this movie not having seen the trailers and not expecting much, which I find generally is the best way to fully enjoy a movie, sadly this movie delivered on my expectations.
A pretty generic storyline, stretched to over 2 hours and missing any real depth. I thought Ant-Man was quite weak for a Marvel movie, but its humour saved it, this one however was ever weaker and just not funny at all. If this is the standard of MCU movies to come, I think they best just give up now.
It isn't terrible, but if people keep praising things that aren't good, all because they believe it stands for something else, then we will keep getting sub-standard productions.
So let's be honest, this movie is average at best, even my 6 rating is probably a tad too high."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,4/10,"This movie isn't even that good. It's just another superhero movie with the same plot and same action as any superhero movie. Nothing new, and nothing original. Sure it can be entertaining, but this movie was just not good."
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,9/10,"As much as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a consistently good track record with each entry that has scored good rating even it has its flaws and error yet Black Panther truly soars as a unique superhero film that blends well with artistic styles, great action as well a great story that takes inspiration and similarities from the Shakespeare's Hamlet as well elements from The Lion King and its political narrative from the underrated The Last Samurai. Clearly, the screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole was truly a great story and the most unique and intriguing pieces of cinema. Even Ryan Coogler's sensible, intense, stylistic and realistic direction and storytelling which draws its similarities to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins as well Ryan Coogler's aesthetics to his previous films such as Fruitvale Station and Creed truly makes this film unique and compelling.What makes Black Panther one of the best films of 2018 was the great, compelling and memorable performances from the ensemble cast which singles out Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Guirira, and Letitia Wright as one of the major stand-outs. This is also a major milestone for cinema to featured black actors and actresses as the main cast which signals a good step in a right direction for representation and diversity as well creating a cultural phenomenon just like what Wonder Woman has achieved for in its major representation for women. Even the breathtaking cinematography, production and costume designs also makes it a great experience and a feast to the eyes.Just like every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther also had its flaws, mostly the CGI effects which was noticeable and has its issues on pacing but nevertheless Black Panther will be no doubt serve in its place as one of the greatest superhero films in cinema history alongside The Dark Knight, Superman (1978 film), and Wonder Woman and has also further transcended the superhero genre in a whole new level as well cemented its cultural and iconic legacy."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"The film has action in it, but its not only about fighting. There are bad characters, who are indeed not entirely evil. There are good characters, who are not without mistakes and weaknesses. Besides I loved the storyline, the characters, the acting, and loved the music. I do not give a damn about the colour of the actors skin in any of the films. It is an awesome film, thats all"
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,3/10,"I looked up Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDb ratings, and they indicate good signs for this movie. However, this came out to be extremely terrible, confusing, poorly developed and full of plot holes.First, they introduce us into a new world, new culture, technically an unknown universe to begin with. But then it quickly moves to actions and stuffs that made me feel completely lost in this Wakanda. Overhyped, I think. They brought all these festivities and vibes all over and forgot that we haven't been around to get any of it. The characters and drives into movies were also unfully developed. Also, one of the male lead's arrival was only discovered after halfway through the movie, that made it unfocused.Unlike any other Marvel, I didn't like the actions at all. They seem so fake, unrealistic and old -- like a false mixtape of a bunch of details from different movies. I was expecting great cultural and action experience, not this crampy hot mess. Is it just me feeling that the only reason critics gave high ratings on this one is that they would be called racist for not doing so? I do not get it."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2020,6/10,"I think this movie is out of standard, and it is another piece of chess piece with enlarged layout. The action scenes and plot highlights are very limited. Some political ambitions are inserted in the middle, but is actually quite bring.
However, professional judges have rated this film very high, and I may not know the highlights."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2019,2/10,"I really wanted to really like Black Panther but honestly after watching black panther 2 times I can't honestly say I don't get the hype this movie is overrated.the CGI was very inconsistent sometimes it was good sometimes it was bad but my main 2 problems with this movie is that the storyline was so slow it was boring and 2nd the main character black panther himself was so boring he had 0 personality yet he was surrounded by entertaining characters with bold personalities that out shined black panther like shuri and okoye they were such strong badass characters and the villain killmonger was really good some positives is that the soundtrack in the movie was great and the costume design was great the characters looked amazing
Overall I found this movie slow paced with a boring main"
BLACK PANTHER,13 January 2019,7/10,Hmmmm it's one of those watchable films more so than the avenger films so not that bad but forgettable so no damage done
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,3/10,"The plot was pretty snooze worthy if you ask me. Do yourself a favor and watch a good movie like The Cloverfield Paradox. I could not sit thru Black Panther again as it had very few actual action set pieces. The car chase was by far the best scene in the movie but sadly that was pretty much the climax of the film. The ""BIG"" action set piece was just boring with a clich√© army set to fight itself because the kid with a chip on his shoulder his whole life makes his way back into the tribe. I also found the main Black Panther fight amongst the bad/good guy also boring. I could easily watch Iron Man again over this and Man of Steel. The story line is so dang simple but yet dragged out for a long time because the bad guy at first isn't really the bad, bad... guy. I found myself wishing I had watched the origin of the 1990 Black Panther instead which they hinted upon in the beginning as I think that would have been far more interesting but it wouldn't actual put BP into the new Avengers films. It just doesn't make much sense that they were fighting Ultron but BP was no where to be seen even though they seem to know everything that is going on... I also drove to the biggest IMAX in South Florida at the Museum of Science and the trailers had more bass than the movie itself. I felt like I wish Jurrasic World was playing instead. Oh well. I hope Infinity Wars makes up for this dreck."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,8/10,However it makes a lot of money but it's not that great that they talk about it I think they exaggerate it but anyway I give it eight
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,8/10,"This movie was great! I actually quite liked the political messaging, and I found myself feeling what it was like to be treated as a minority for the first time - it was a really interesting and funny experience having a majority black cast and a ""token white guy"" instead of the reverse! The special effects were also very good, and the costumes quite creative. I think they overdid the ""challenge for the crown"", but the rest of the film was solid, and Wakanda is beautiful.I can definitely recommend this movie and am happy I saw it, though it might not be for you if you're white and squeamish about race or getting pulled out of your comfort zone."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,,"Black Panther (2018, Ryan Coogler)We first saw the African superhero 'Black Panther' in Captain America: Civil War and now we see him on his home turf and find out about the origins and history of the royal hero. The film itself is very afrocentric with a great and mostly black cast including Czhadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett as well as a a host of lesser known young talent. I was surprised to feel shades of a James Bond style adventure for the first act before it moved to something else but I did enjoy that while it lasted.One of the many things I like about this film is the tone as it deals with some pretty relevant and serious racial subject matter with respect and class. Also, where as many of the more recent Marvel films have gone for a more slapstick and one-liners approach, this film uses a more natural humour that does not take you out of the film but enhances it. It has a strong script that fleshes out a lot of the characters and makes their motivations believable and clear even when in unbelievable settings. At no stage are anyone's actions leaving you scratching your head and it is the strength of the script, characters and acting that helps one overlook the films few shortcomings.Where the film falters is in the action sequences and cgi. A lot of the special effects look unfinished or as if they might've been done ten or more years ago. The wardrobe design is excellent but some of the vehicle design could have been better. The worst offender for me though was the combat sequences which were often dark, overly edited and shaky. I was surprised at this because the director's boxing work on his film Creed (2015) was some of the best I have seen but here it was a mess. However the belief in the characters and what they are fighting for can still make you invested in these scenes despite their unpleasant presentation.All in all, I think this was a home-run for Marvel, yet again doing a great job with one of their lesser known comic book properties. I expect this film to do big business world wide and should please most as it feels like a real film, with real characters and stakes and not just disposable popcorn entertainment. It is a shame some of the special effects feel so rushed but I guess deadlines have to be met to keep the MCU juggernaut moving along and quality control will suffer here and there.7-7.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,6/10,"The Black Panther is written to be to pander too many different types of people, and in the end impresses no one and draws a 'meh' from everyone.In a nutshell, the movie is the story of the 'black panther' becoming king and learning that 'heavy lies the head that wears the crown' in the process.It is a comic book movie and seems to be written for kids. The characters lack depth. There is a fair bit of hyperbole and even over-acting in some scenes, which might appeal to the younger audience.There are several plot holes and some attempts to conceal plot holes are ill explained and contrived for the sake of subsequent action scenes. So, it seems the writers made and attempt to create a coherent narrative but did not do a good job of it.If the movie kept itself to a simple comic action movie fanfare, then it would be fine. Unfortunately, the movie delves into mature territory of race issues and falls woefully short of reasonable treatment of this serious topic.Implicit in the movie is the confrontation between the politically left-wing 'black panther' and his right-wing cousin. As the movie progresses, the black panther becomes a politically centrist (essentially Obama) and the antagonist becomes ultra right-wing (almost Trump). Consequently, Black Panther could also have been called Obama vs. Trump. The Republican audience in US would call the writers of this movie as 'snowflakes' for the movie is clearly biased in favor of the left-wing 'black panther'. The humor in the movie came from the confrontation between Gholum (Andy Serkis) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) as they were both after 'Precious Ring' (Vibranium metal) which gives great power for global conquest. Martin Freeman also plays the 'token white friend' in the movie where the joke is the inversion of the 'token black friend', but Martin Freeman's character has to be schooled in movie logic that 'token friend' has no meaningful dialogue.Overall, Black Panther could and should have been much better than it was. It had the obligation to make a bold statement without the need to pander to people's prejudices. That after all is what art is!!"
BLACK PANTHER,3 April 2018,10/10,"This was a great movie. I rank it among my top favorite Marvel movies, which include the first Avengers and the first Guardians of the Galaxy movies.An interesting, original story that keep me engaged the whole time. One thing that really impressed me was how all the fighting was made very meaningful. Often with these movies I get bored with the fight scenes. So tedious. You know who will win, just get it over with. However, somehow with this movie I cared about each of the fights, and I was on the edge of my seat.It was very interesting to see an all-black (mostly) cast, and to see the African theme. I was impressed with the depth and meta aspect too - it presents two possible ways to address injustice - which path will these people choose? Great lessons here, besides just action and adventure.For such a great movie, how to explain all the user ratings of 1, 2 and 3? It certainly doesn't deserve those. I leave it to you to imagine why some of these people are rating it so artificially low."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"I can see why Kevin Feige thought this was the best MCU film yet. It got style, it got action, it got drama, it got heart and boy does it tear you up in the end. The only MCU villain I have teared up for. This movie is amazing and it portrays what a perfectly written villain and support characters look in a film. I can't wait for a sequel. And yes, Okoye may as well be the best fighter in the MCU. With those spear throwing skills, she would've easily killed doomsday without breaking a sweat. Lol."
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2018,3/10,"I only have one complaint with this movie. The ""bad"" guy blaming everyone for his troubles. His father, whom he was seeking revenge, was a thief and was dealt with. What was there to get revenge for? Could someone, just once, point out that fact?"
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2019,9/10,"The critical acclaim is well deserved. It may not be a perfection or the best Marvel movie ever, but it is arguably the most well rounded and mature Marvel movie yet. Definitely top 5 when it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, arguably top 3."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,4/10,"The movie had a very weak plot and compensated for the lack of plot with violence. It's just a typical ""Disney has no creativity and resorts to turning stuff that was popular in the 1960s into movies"".I missed a good 30 minutes of the movie because I fell asleep from boredom. 
 The stuff I woke up to felt like a fanfiction of the Iliad. Move the Iliad from Africa to Greece and get rid of the Trojan Horse, give it some super high tech equipment and that was pretty much this movie.I would've given it a worse rating, but there was a hot man shirtless throughout most of it, so that made it more enjoyable. Plus I also saw Red Sparrow, and it would have been an insult to humanity to give your typical Disney, superhero, plotless, violence a rating as low as a movie that's just brutal violence towards women.Also, how is something violent only rated PG-13? I've seen less violent movies that were rated R."
BLACK PANTHER,9 July 2019,2/10,Mediocre movie that got overhyped. Not worth all the praise that it got.
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,"I experienced movie in 3D and images are not so impressive but if I compare to DC's CGI level, this movie is better than justice league. However, Black Panter is best cricticized marvel movie by critics I think it so exaggerated and these reviews shows us crictics are not so reliable to determine how a movie is good. I think this movie is like Thor 3, Marvel tried little bit different thing and shows another civilization and place like we see in Thor 3 also politics is involved intensely.
Generally, I liked the cast especially chadwick boseman, Michael B.jordan Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis(I wish we could see Andy Serkis much more). Action sequences is not as efficient as like in Russo brother's movies but there is afew prominent action scenes but I think there should be much more action scenes. Hoewever, villains are most strong side of the film, there is one big plot hole why T'challa's father didn't bring Killmonger to the Wakanda or kill him too? to sum up, for me this movie an average superhero movie and definitley I woulldn't count this movie as top moives in MCU, If I would sort movies this movie could be barely in top 10 in MCU. I give 6 out of 10 for the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2018,10/10,"I just finished this and absolutely loved it! Every single person did such an awesome job. But let me say, Michael did such a good job with his character he blew my mind! Wow.. just wow. I was sad when it ended. Such a good story line. Every emotion u have, u will use it in this movie. I hope there is a sequel."
BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2021,1/10,"If you're binging the Marvel series, skip this one, just go the emd credits, you will have missed nothing important.This was an awful watch. I couldn't bring myself to watch this one again. I watched Captain marvel again even though that was as s#it, but this just isn't marvel.The movie doesn't feel quality, from the script to the direction to everything.This movie should had been made in native African language as a documentry and nothing more."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is the latest movie from Marvel Universe based on the eponymous character. The movie is already a big hit across the globe. Team OI reviews the movie & tells you whether the movie is worth the hype.
we wish to inform our readers that, we are not die hard Marvel fans. We went to the movie with no expectations as such. But we were curious to learn as to why the world is going gaga about this movie.The movie starts off with the story of how the Black Panther came into existence several centuries back. We are told that vibranium is the source of all the power of Wakanda. Wakanda is the Black Panther's kingdom in Africa. While Wakanda is advanced in terms of technology, they prefer to be isolated from the world. They decide to pose as a third world nation. King T'Chaka accuses his brother N'Jobu of assisting Ulysses Klaue & kills him. Post the death of King T'Chaka, his son - T'Challa returns to Wakanda to lay claim to the throne. Post becoming King & being bestowed with the powers of the Black Panther, King T'Challa unsuccessfully tries to nab Ulysses Klaue.
We are later informed that N'Jobu fell in love with an American woman. They had a kid together, Erik A.K.A The killmonger, comes to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa & lay claim to the throne. Does he succeed? Does Wakanda attack the world & end up ruling it as per Killmonger's plans? Watch the movie to find out.
Director Ryan Coogler must be credited for portraying Africans like never before. African culture has been brilliantly showcased in the movie. Africans across the globe are sure to be proud of this movie. The two duels involving T'Challa are excellently shot. This story moves at a brisk pace. One need not be an ardent Marvel or Black panther comics fan to enjoy the movie. Chadwick Boseman is excellent in his role as the Black Panther. He has set the benchmark in terms of portraying the superhero. He has perfected the African accent to suit the character. Michael B. Jordan as The Kilmonger is bad ass. His menacing looks & superb acting makes you hate him. There are several known African Americans in the movie. Martin Freeman who plays CIA agent Everett K Ross is good in his role. ever Forrest Whittaker(Zuri) adds weight to the supporting cast. The soundtrack is one of the best we have heard for the longest time. The music will haunt you for days or probably weeks.
There are no flaws in the movie whatsoever.
Go watch the movie without contemplating any further. This movie is a treat for people of all ages."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,5/10,"Standard Marvel moving nothing great about the film. The plot was nearly the same as the Lion King. Father Dies, Son has to step up but is challenged by family member, and fight with friends help to regain rightful throne. Also throw in love interest that's always loved him and dream like sequence with deceased father "" Remember"" .
Would have been better had the fit in James Earl Jones some how? Definitely not on par with The Avengers (2012) or any of the three Thor movies or three Captain America films. People were literally snoring in my theatre on a Friday night during 2nd weekend."
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,5/10,"Ok film, but not the watershed moment that it's been represented as. Nearly fell asleep. Btw why wasn't Lupita in Infinity War?"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,2/10,It could be great. It could be fun. It's stereotypical and insulting. Great cast though...
BLACK PANTHER,30 June 2019,5/10,"Good...but overhyped
Story was good..so was the ending...but the climax fight was just horrible
Why would they turn it into a game fight"
BLACK PANTHER,6 October 2020,10/10,"Chadwick Boseman will always be true legend, inspired millions around the world. One of my favorite actors and people out there, rest in peace to this legend."
BLACK PANTHER,1 May 2019,6/10,"I'll be perfectly honest, Black Panther is a good superhero movie in it's own right, but is it Oscar worthy? Maybe, maybe not.It has good actors, a decent story and very impressive visual stylings but the CGI is really clunky in some places and the pacing really does tend to fall off in places, plus some of the jokes fall flat in this.The main thing that really saves this movie is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan, he was once the Human Torch in Fan4stic but that movie failed miserably in 2015, now he has redeemed himself as one of the best Marvel movie villains, so compelling and so wonderfully performed. This guy deserves an Oscar for certain!But I want to keep this brief as I don't want to be too controversial as I know that this film is really beloved by millions of people around the world and has a real cultural significance on the entire world.It's not a movie that I want to rewatch over and over again but I do like the character of Black Panther and Chadwick Boseman plays him really well."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2020,8/10,"First of all I have to question the worthiness of this film being Oscar nominated for best picture. It is a Marvel film. They are designed and adored for their entertainment value, which is fantastic - their critical acclaim less so. I think the only reason Black Panther reached these wavering heights during awards season was because of its attempts to scratch the surface on some social and racial themes, but the message is weak and never really makes any sort of impact. Other than that slight criticism however I rate this as a really enjoyable watch and another great addition to the MCU.As a Walking Dead fan I loved Danai Gurira's role in this film, playing the part of the strong female warrior as brilliantly as always. Daniel Kaluuya was wasted somewhat, he's excellent in Get Out and deserved a bigger role here, and there's something a bit shallow about Martin Freeman's CIA man Everett Ross, who I'm not particularly excited to see more of in Marvel films to come. The standout performance comes from Andy Serkis, who we rarely see on screen without the guise of motion capture animation - after watching him portray Ulysses Klaue in Black Panther you'll be asking yourself the same question I did... why not?! He is fantastic as Klaue. It's a shame the writers cut his screen time short and opted to lead the plot down the Lion King path, as I believe he could've made for a better primary antagonist.An honourable mention must be made to the soundtrack, which rivals that of Guardians of the Galaxy for the MCU's no.1 spot (and that's no mean feat). Overall the cast and writing do just about enough to make Black Panther another classic Marvel hit."
BLACK PANTHER,12 December 2020,8/10,"While I absolutely give this movie a positive review, I think it's one of the most overrated MCU movies. I just don't understand people hailing as one of the best films in the MCU. I'm not saying there's necessarily anything wrong with it, it's just not as great as some claim. With that out of the way, here are some positives! The score is amazing and it even won an Academy Award for this very reason. Also, Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan shine in this and it's one of their best performances, ever! Letitia Wright as Shuri is also very entertaining and she's one of my favorite MCU characters. Overall, this was a very good and rewatchable movie."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"The real star in the movie ""Black Panther"", as I took it, should have been Wakanda. You have this super-powerful but cloaked little technology empire inmidst of Africa. Sure this movie is about Black Panther but it is also a lot about questions like those: should Wakanda be isolated since this worked, or open up its technology to other countries? Should it help out expat Wakandans or weaker countries or refugees? Unfortunately, this movie fails to really sell those points. The characters talk about it, but fail to show it. On the pro-side of ""Black Panther"", there is mainly the stellar cast. Chadwick Boseman, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyongo, Martin Freeman, Serkis, all great actors. The discovery here is Letitia Wright as T'challas bubbly sister. The movie plays it pretty straight and thats unfortunate. There is nothing really bad about the plot except that Killmongers story does at parts not fit perfectly in. 
But as hard they tried to sell Wakanda as amazing place, its somehow unimaginative especially when this movie is pitted back to back with Thor 3. It never comes to live the same way as the Grandmasters Junkyard/gladiator planet. They fall short also to sell Killmonger as villain. Its a tragic character, he has his birthright and his life was taken away by the ""good guys"". But they miss the opportunity to give him he more leverage; he longs to see Wakanda but when gets there he just does run-off-the-mill evil villainry. It would be much more interesting if this was a guy who would be actually hard to fight for Black Panther. Also, Serkis has the time of his life playing a wacko gangster and he gives a scene-chewing performance in the style of guys like Christopher Walken or Nicholas Cage which makes Michael B. Anthony almost look bland in comparison. Surely, Black Panther suffers a bit from Marvel oversaturation. The origin story was a bit similar to Thor I; the action scenes don't offer much new against the amazing fights in ""Winter Soldier""; and even the stakes are not so high, there is no ""aliens or a super weapon"" are destroying the world. It says something if even the typical Marvel spoilers in the end credits are relatively un-revealing."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"Black Panther did garner many whistles with its brief appearance in Civil War. MCU left no stone unturned in investing above $200 m in the film which is huge considering its not as popular as other super heroes. But last few months it has generated so much hype that, the box office estimates have gone over the roofs.The same hype made me crazy enough to not able to contain my excitement and subsequently find out what the fuss is all about. Strangely, even when the film is done I am still asking the same question. Black Panther starts off with one of the most important scenes of the film that becomes the fulcrum on which it develops its plot post mid-way. The story without spoilers is basically about a precious metal, Vibranium which is the root reason of the secret city, Wakanda's technological advancement and power. It is about whether it should be available to the people around the world for other countries' problems and if yes, who gets to decide the right people who should lay hands on the massive power. And if no, then is it really right to continue its use for the selfish well-being of Wakanda alone?
Keeping all the hype aside (Rotten Tomatoes' 97% score, Box Office), I found the film strictly just ""good"". The characters are well developed, Wakanda city has been beautifully realized and the conventional Marvel wit adds to the charm of the whole. But the film never really takes off to build enough tension to keep us engrossingly glued. It is more of an exhibition of the tribes of Africa and their rich persevered culture. It also makes clear statements of racist atrocities and its payback, whether it is Killmonger screaming his lungs on how T'Challa should use the power of Vibranium for ""their people"" or the frequent use of ""these Americans"" in a form of their subjugation to the Wakandians. With past few Marvel films showing an individualistic innovative style of action, this film fails to offer anything that impresses you beyond the anchoring use of claws. More than the Black Panther or Killmonger, it is Andy Serkins' Ulysses Klaue that steals away your attention with captivating screen presence of a chilled maniac. Unfortunately, the appearance is limited to brief after which Killmonger takes over. Killmonger played by Michael Jordan feels like an immature street punk hip-hopping away his dialogues. When he starts talking, all you feel like saying is, ""You just lack some knuckle slaps when you were growing up"". His motivation is without depth or understanding, its too outlined to generate any taste for the villain. Even T'Challa, whether he played a king or even a super hero, always felt like a character who is undergoing a 2 month course with his shrink for confidence issues. The music shifts gears in discontinued forms from rap beats to African tribal and the usual loud score for action sequences.Overall, the film is an entertaining pass time for the well etched characters and the relationships among them, some unexpected comical expressions that was very subtly fit into the writing and a refreshing change from the usual we have been coming across."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2019,1/10,"If you like wasting your time and don't mind watching garbage then this is the movie for you. Boring, predictable, over hyped and poor acting are the main ingredients of this useless drivel. This definitely does not compare to other Marvel movies.I'm not going to go into the PC bull that is portrayed in this movie, but if you don't like PC garbage in movies then this movie will sorely disappoint. I like movies that are motivated to entertain and tell an interesting story! As soon as I get a wiff of political nonsense, my bull**** sensor goes off and I start to dread what I'm watching.The only positive thing I can say about this piece of garbage is that the special effects are nice looking and was done well - but no matter how good it was this movie still deserves a solid 1 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,10/10,"If you just love a good movie with a bit comedy, this is perfect. I did not wasted my money because I enjoyed every piece of the movie. WELL DONE. if you don't like it that's your business, there will always be GOOD and BAD on earth. #FAN"
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,4/10,"I am surprised the average star rate is as high as it is.
I just felt they made this movie for the sake of it. Nothing novel about it.
No comedy intertwined
Martin Freeman hopelessly out of character
I never really got the feeling that I cared for what they were actually fighting for.All a bit - Meh! with good visuals really.Oh well, at least they can wedge in another character to the Marvels Universe."
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2019,8/10,"Black Panther is a superhero movie with great emotional depth. Deep themes and exciting action. Its puts the black panther on the map for bad ass superheroes. It's a tale about redemption and maybe this is just because of Michael b Jordan but I saw themes from creed 2 or even rocky 3. Michael b Jordan does fine, his character is great but I dont think hes the best fit for a villian. The directing is the best highlight of the film, I am a big fan of Coogler and this helped his case even more so. Martin Freeman does great like always, and so does Danai Gurira and Boseman of course. Some jokes dont really work, but theres not really much else to complain about. The music is great too. It's about as good as the first iron man, and a tad worse than the winter soldier. 80%"
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,8/10,"Long Live The King! Whatever I say about the movie will be a little. Definitely ""Black Panther"" takes its place as one of the strongest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast is probably the best in a Marvel solo movie. ""Black Panther"" shows an unseen part of the MCU - Wakanda, their tribes, secrets and their way of life.Indeed, one of the strongest features of the film is the acting of everyone in this movie. I can't say only one name, but Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira, Angela Basset, Letita Wright and Forest Whitaker are just some of the best characters in this movie.The story is really strong, which makes the movie so good. Michael B. Jordan played the role of Erik Killmonger brutally. After the movie ends, the villain gets stuck in your mind, just because you understand his motivation and is presented perfectly, in two words ""memorable villain"". If you have not become Chadwick Boseman's fan in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" it's inevitable now! T'Challla must lead his people, be king and hero at the same time, which is a heavy burden.Every scene between him and his sister Shuri is a pleasure. She is only 16 years old, but her intellect can be compared to that of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.Special attention should be paid to every action scene. Movements and choreography are just unparalleled. You will make sure you see Black Panther, Killmonger and Okoye in action.The colors in this movie are unique! The effects are great, except in some in some places in the final battle.The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is great. After the end of the movie, you will want to listen the songs of the album.The movie introduces us the story of Wakanda in depth and gives us many new characters, all of whom are great.In the future, ""Black Panther"" will be one of the often watched Marvel movies, as T'Challa is a person who easily gains the audience's sympathy, and you will not have passion to see him in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience, watch the movie as soon as possible!"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,10/10,"Beyond being one of the most culturally impactful films of recent history, it's both fun and thought provoking. Most of the characters are multi-dimensional and richly developed. T'Challa, the king of Wakanda and the Black Panther fights to decide what is the right path for his people. Shuri, his sister is a genius teen who still dresses and acts like a teenager. Eric (Killmonger) Stevens is a villain who we can empathize with while rooting for his demise. Nakia, T'Challa's Ex, shows that a fierce warrior can be compassionate and socially responsible. Too many great characters with great potential to say how many will spawn other efforts.
Costuming and sets are world class but the story is truly compelling for a Marvel based hero."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,6/10,I loved Ceed so had high hopes. It delivered what it had too with good action a good message but nothing more substantial. At times I felt I was watching an episode from Stsr Trek the original series with creeky sets and all. One scene in the casino seemed to be straight from Skyfall. Coogler is a talent but not sure his vision suited this genre. Nothing new but solid enough especially if your a 14 year old.
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,5/10,"Is this a sociopolitical movie that everyone loves about? Or is it a superhero movie? This movie tried to be both and it was bad at it. The cultural and musical part about it was the best. But really that's it. You won't be surprised about anything. And it tries to give a simple villain. Ryan Coogler made other movies feel fresh, but this felt like a list on what to do."
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2019,7/10,Black Panther Introduces you to the world of Wakanda really well and the Characters are great and the villain is phenomenal. What the movie does not do right is the CGI and the pacing in the 1st Act. 8/10 B+
BLACK PANTHER,29 December 2018,7/10,The movie was decent but is not special as everyone says it is.
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2020,8/10,"Advanced science and technology, double enjoyable of sight and hearing,young sister very cool,she is my favorite character, it's represented woman smart, man can do, also woman can!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,4/10,"I like comic-book movies as I read a lot of Marvel and DC comics when I was a child but I had mixed expectations of Black Panther. Mostly because I didn't read much of his comics and the character did not interest me much.However the movie had great reviews and smashed a lot of box office records and Marvel movies have a good quality on average. But Black Panther I have to say was well below that average.The action scenes were bland and not on par with other Marvel/DC movies and the CGI, which there is a lot of, was surprisingly mediocre. The story was bland and didn't make much sense to me. Something about some metal with magical properties giving both enhanced super powers and technology and they managed to somehow hide that from the rest of the world by isolating and hiding a whole country? I mean in a world like Marvel where you have SHIELD and other super-spy organisations, none of them could figure out this high tech country? No, that is just nonsense, even for a comic book movie.The characters were not that very interesting either. You have more than the usual dose of feminism with super smart and super strong female characters, none of which had much depth and were there just because they were women. The villain in the movie did show some promise but they didn't really explore him much and the hero, Black Panther, I can't say had neither the flare of Tony Stark nor the heart of Peter Parker. He was just another bland character in a bland movie with bland actors."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,10/10,"Wow! What an amazing film! Just everything; from the story, to the acting,
the cinematogrophy, the camerawork, the special effects.. everything felt like
a beautiful piece of art.Acting 10/10: The cast does an amazing job doing their roles. Michael B. Jordan.. I cant say enough good things about this character. He's relatable, yet so so menacing... an actual threat for not T'challa or the world perse, but the goal of T'challa.. to his actual legacy. The women were amazing and empowering, showing they can also love and choose to be warriors(not because they cant come out of wakanda.........). Cinematogrophy/VFX 9/10: Beautiful. Seriously beautiful. There are some iffy moments in the action scenes especially at the end were every tiny detail is CGI. The movements are very gracious and quick, which make for wonky image sometimes. Story 10/10: This story is AIRTIGHT. For me it was kind of a perfect. Everything wove in perfectly. Every storybit had a pay off. The scenes served the story and not the other way around, which results in a rewarding film and is very rare. I think I only saw that in maybe civil war, winter soldier and the dark knight. All in All, I cant stop loving this film. It is perfect for me. Yes I complained about the wonky CGI sometimes, but thats because you can't have zero negatives in a review right? I would give it a 10/10,, because i will watch it much more in the theatres."
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2021,7/10,Test....eu estou apenas fazendo um teste para saber quanto ei preciso escrever aqui. N√£o sei ao certo mas assisti o filme e √© muito bom. Infelizmente o excelente ator faleceu jovem em decorr√™ncia de um c√¢ncer. Era casado e tinha filhos. N√£o o conhecia muito bem como ator mas √© talentoso e muito profissional. N√£o sei mais o que escrever.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"I've read many of the reviews already posted, and I'm really surprised of the wide range of opinions. I truly feel like some who are giving it a poor rating wanted to dislike it from the beginning. Having said that, I admit I was looking forward to this movie for sometime, but I wasn't expecting it to live up to the hype. 
I think this is one of the best Marvel movies they have ever made. Visually it was stunning. The action was top notch. But beyond all that, I thought the story was great and well written. Michael B. Jordan stole the show and was convincing in his anger and thirst for revenge. 
Overall, I loved it and thought that everyone involved did a great job. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater and I'll probably buy it down the road."
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2021,5/10,"This could of been the greatest marvel movie of them all , and it parts it is . It tackles the historical fight for black freedom & equality amongst all men. The Xhosa is fantastic, John Kani was a welcome sight too.But poor Chadwick is forced to play the earnest young king while all around appear to believe that they are in an American sit com pretending to be a James Bond film.Andy serkis & Chadwick Boseman are excellent as is Martin Freeman but that's about it.Apparently Tony stark isn't the smartest person alive either , seemingly it's a wakandian teen reject from an alternative universe Cosby showOh dear , he could of been brilliant but wasn't."
BLACK PANTHER,8 August 2020,4/10,"Black panther/characters were great in Civil War and Infinity War/End Game. But this movie wasn't great. Shuri is the only good part. I'm watching because I watched the whole series again now that End Game and Far From Home are done, but apart from that I wouldn't watch it for fun. Overdone plot, Unlyse's Klau is a better character than Kilmonger. Was not a fan of Michael B Jordan's character. Also, armored rhinos coming up from the ground?! Wouldn't it have made more sense to have... you know, black panthers?"
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,7/10,"T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) plans to succeed the throne from his dead father, but new and old enemies challenge his position as a new leader in Wakanda. To make things worse, Wakanda adopts isolationist tactics to hide a precious metal called Vibranium that makes this African country technologically superior. Can T'Challa continue to rule this country from outsiders (and insiders too) and keep Vibranium from the world?Chadwick Boseman triumphs as T'Challa; his portrayal isn't as transformative as his previous works (Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and Thurgood Marshall), but it's intelligent and competent. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett provide great comic relief and a substantial amount of substance and power in this movie. Michael B. Jordan plays a strong villain with a valid reason. The director, Ryan Coogler, emphasizes his concerns and priorities ranging from isolationism, oppression, aiding strangers, and acceptance of African and African-American experiences. Also, there's some sick beats in this movie (da-dum da-dum DOOM WUBWUBWUB WOMP tshh).Pacing structure is odd (or does the film have a structural problem in Act One). By odd, I mean, the first act of the film (so the first thirty minutes) relies on a lot foreshadowing and world-building which is a hindrance. Mainly, a hindrance because these narrative elements complicate the plot. It's great to watch a Marvel movie with a complex plot, but it removes the fun and becomes serious (that may confuse the family friendly demographic, specifically children).Additionally, the film drags in the middle and the end. In the end, CGI consumes the fight scenes making the film less intense and becomes hard to cheer for a character in a CGI suit that fights less like a human and more akin to a cartoon. Finally, some moments feel similar to ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" (maybe I'm the only person who experienced that feeling). Although I have objections, their minor and finicky, shouldn't thwart a satisfying movie experience."
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,4/10,"I used to collect and read some of the Black Panther comics in the 80's. I don't remember them being full of racist and historically fictitious diatribe, which is basically what this movie is. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it's just kind of pathetic. The movie keeps harping on the ideas that Africa would somehow be a world leader, if not for the evil white colonialists, as if anyone in their right mind actually believes that. The villain makes comments about how everything was stolen from Africa by a white women's ""ancestors"". The uncle says how the black people of planet earth are ""unfairly"" policed and incarcerated..i.e. ""Dundu Nuffin"". The black sister calls the white CIA agent a ""colonizer"", as if he is somehow responsible for the actions of people hundreds, if not thousands, of years before he was born. The most hypocritical line in the movie then follows, when the wife of Black Panther tells him ""you can't let your fathers mistakes define who you are""...yet this whole movie tries to define all of the white characters as ""oppressors"" and ""colonizers"", because of what their ancestors supposedly did. So why doesn't Wakanda use their special mineral to take over the world? Because they are peaceful and respectful people, and it's not their way....as if Africa is not a war torn continent that has been murdering and enslaving it's own people for the entirety of written history. This movie is nothing but a trite and disappointing political smear job from start to finish. Sad."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"A common thread in Marvel films has been how past actions, before the hero has his power, come back around to present consequences. Black Panther is no exception. In the same way that Tony Stark's behavior when he was a party boy caused him problems many years later, T'Challa's fathers decisions from his youth have reprecussions on his son's, and country's, future.Wakanda presents itself as practically a utopia, as its citizens have built incredibly upon its supply of Vibranium and the skills of its warrior kings. We see T'Challa ascend the throne, as we expected after the events of Civil War, and the challenges that come along with such a role.While Chadwick Boseman is a strong, capable lead who creates a sympathetic and intriguing lead character, the true stars of this film for my money are Shuri and Killmonger. Shuri isn't just the wiseguy support character that so many of the people that provide technical help to a hero is. She is a strong, vital woman in her own right who makes a difference in multiple ways, and is a pleasure to see appear on screen. Nakia and Okoye can also make these claims; they are also much stronger than many female characters are allowed to be, even within the MCU, and they too light up the screen and provide great support to the story.
Killmonger has been receiving a great deal of praise as the best MCU villain to date, and it's hard to disagree. His history is replete with violence and intellect, and he has found a way to combine those two to become a powerful force when he goes to settle his grudge. He speaks intelligently, with conviction, and with firm and complex ideas about what he intends to do. He does this all while initially seeming like an average American. Michael B. Jordan as such turns in easily the best performance of a villain this side of Loki, and elevates the film each time he is on screen.This is a more serious film from start to finish than most Marvel films lately; it is grounded, and while still flashing that trademark wit, and fun action set pieces that we've come to expect, its true strength is found between the lines with well-written characters and an interesting plot that can keep even the most casual Marvel fan transfixed.Now is the time to talk about the cultural impact of this movie. The convention of films with primarily African-American cast members being unreliable in box office terms is surely shattered now. This film has helped show those that would claim to be experts that it doesn't matter what color the skin of the cast is, if the movie is good, people will see it.There is so much black culture evident in the threads of this film, from its opening to its closing scenes, and even at least one of the post-credit scenes. The inescapable nature of trying to improve their lot in the world, and what role they should take, is woven throughout, and presents numerous conflicts that only serve to make the film as a whole even better. Ryan Coogler deserves all the praise he is getting for creating such a thematically strong film that transcends its genre while still managing to be a great part of it.Infinity War is coming soon, and following it and Avengers 4, it is sure that T'Challa and Wakanda will be a huge part of the next phase of the MCU. I, for one, am eager to see how things shake out, and will be ready to plant my butt in a seat for Black Panther 2, whenever it happens."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"This film defied the expectations of the superhero film. Intimate, yet grande. Personal yet universal. This film was fantastic and nearly without flaw. As usual a pro's and con's list.Cons -Ryan Coogler is inexperienced when it comes to CGI so it's acceptable that his first mega budget feature film would have some dodgy CGI and this really only comes into the third act.The kiss between Nakia and T'Challa was iffy.And literally that is it, everything else about this film was brilliant.Pros -Chadwick Boseman is the King of Wakanda. He is brilliant, conflicted, nuanced and powerful both physically and emotionally. A King was born in Civil War and he has kept that title.Michael B Jordan was also very good (though not as good as everyone has claimed) in his role. You understand his motives and his scenes with his father were seriously emotional.Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were impeccable as Nakia and Okoye. Both had great scenes, fantastic dialogue and it was great too see two powerful women of colour in leading roles.Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke were also in respectable roles. Kaluuya working very well with what he was given and Duke rising through the scenes he shared with strong A listers.Angela Bassett and Letita Wright were great as T'Challa's family. Bassett wasn't really given much to do but was very realistic within the more emotional scenes. Wright was also very entertaining to watch and the future implications for her character are very exciting. Yet another star is born.Forest Whitaker, Sterling K Brown, John Kani, Seth Carr, Denzel Whitaker and Atandwa Kani were among my favourites. They all brought raw emotion, gravitas and pure empathy for their characters. Brilliant work.Finally, Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman were given less to do but were solid within their roles. I just can't help but feel Serkis was a little wasted in the MCU but still nevertheless very entertaining and always fun to watch.Side note it was great too see Alex R Hibbert (Little from Moonlight) in a small role.Wakanda is so beautiful and glorious to watch as is the action that unfolds within.The humour was perfect and in the right places. Very pleased it was not overbearing.The opening was breathtaking and had me on edge.Some of the dialogue such as Killmonger's final line were completely riveting.The entire spiritual side of this film was so beautiful and emotional it was so glorious to see this side of a superhero and it made for some genuine raw emotion.The costumes were brilliant as were the weapons and the cultural tribes of Wakanda.The social commentary was the most important and honestly breathtaking parts of the film. The way it was current and fresh was just so right and Coogler has really made this film his own. The commentary on certain events just felt so right to include within this film.Overall this film was just so damn good. The racial / social commentary was so relevant, the action sequences were so exciting, the cast are all on point and most importantly this film is both so intimate yet grande in regards to the MCU. The entire cast and of course Ryan Coogler should be commended for showcasing the beautiful world of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,7/10,"It almost goes without saying with most superhero movies coming out as of late that if you go into it expecting the next Citizen Kane or 12 Angry Men, you'll be disappointed. However with Black Panther if you go into it looking for a fun, energetic action romp you likely will not leave disappointed.If you follow the logic of ""a movie is only as good as it's villain"" as many do, I think you'll be quite pleased with Michael B. Jordan and his portrayal of Killmonger. He truly seems as though he invested himself into the character and it might be one of the best performances he's given throughout his career so far. He had believable motives, intriguing development and the story took turns with his character that caught me by surprise.While Chadwick Boseman pails in comparison to Michael B. Jordan, his performance is certainly nothing to shake a stick at. He gives about the best performance he can since his character dialogue has a lot of monotone, stern delivery as you would expect from a superhero we are supposed to expect a leadership figure from. Talking about the story, some may find it predictable as it is definitely possible to draw a lot of similarities to past stories like The Lion King, but I think that there is still turns that plenty of the audience won't see coming.Going to the visuals, I would consider them absolutely stunning. Wakanda is a beautiful place and the production team brought it to life with ease. We are taken through a few different set pieces that kept the film flowing and has no trouble maintaining your attention.A couple of my biggest gripes would be that some characters that we are lead to believe carry an important weight to the story are inexplicably absent for a large portion of the movie, which did leave me wondering for a couple portions of the film. Another is the way some scenes are lit or just too dark to see anything, unfortunately. Something I noticed but it didn't impede my viewing experience too much to make a bigger complaint of. All in all, I recommend checking this one out if you're a superhero movie fan, but if you despise superhero movies and are sick of seeing them come out, this one probably won't change your mind."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"When i first heard about this movie I was not that excited. Marvel has been spitting out sequels that have been pretty trash the last few years. But I went in without knowing much about the characters, story, or plot. I saw one trailer and that was it. This movie stunned me. It's probabbly one of the best Marvel movies to come out. The action sequences alone were stunning. Michael B Jordan is such a good villain although I'm hesitant if they come out with a second one, because Marvel has a problem with villains."
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,2/10,"They made their money, good for them. This movie is mediocre at best. But let's be honest, Thor 1&2 were pretty bad too and have a solid rating of 7,0 on Imdb. So this movie was not the worst ever, it was just bad. But because of the black cast we must hype it and say it's sooo great. It's not. Now many give it 1 star, because they hate the hype about such a poorly written movie that didn't offer something new or exciting. That's what you get for all the false advertisement and the paid critics. Shame on every critic out there."
BLACK PANTHER,11 February 2019,10/10,"Black Panther is one of the best movie I've ever seen. It was released in 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler. It was 2h15 long.This movie is a perfect mixture of action, adventure, sci-fi and fantasy. The cast is very judicious because the actors who play in this film are famous: Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman - who is the main character -, Winston Duke, Lupita, Letitia Wright...The plot is very original and it shows African culture in Wakanda. Flying cars, virtual reality, big rhinoceros, incredible costumes and arms are present during the film.The special effects are very realistic and amazing, we can see they worked hard for this movie.The soundtrack corresponds very well to the action.My favourite moment is when T'Challa, T'Chaka's son, eats the heart grass and sees his father who is dead in the ancestor world.During a ritual combat, N'Jadaka, cousin of T'Challa - king of Wakanda - pushes T'Challa from the top of the clif. Everbody thinks he is dead. N'Jadaka becomes the king.Shuri, the sister of T'Challa, her mother, Nakia and Ross go see M'Baku, the king of the Jabari tribe to give one heart grass but a fisherman has found T'Challa and he brought him to M'Baku. Nakia and Shuri's mother give the flower and he wakes up.Watch the movie to know the end!To me, this movie is rated 10 out of 10 stars."
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,6/10,"How does this get a 7.4 on IMDb with most hated reviews? The movie has so many plot holes, lame characters. I'll give some points for a few cool scenes like the car scene. Otherwise, what happened?"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"So I saw this movie last night and I must say it was AMAZING!! I loved the way this movie looked, it was stunning. Chadwick Boseman was amazing as was Micheal B. Jordan, They both are amazing actors. The story was great also, My only real issue with this movie was basically Andy Serkis character.But seriously AMAZING film, and definitely in my list of Favorite Marvel Movies"
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,5/10,"Archie (WhatsApp friend ;)) is very serious about films. Besides Bob, she is my other source of information on the latest movie releases. My movie plans revolve around Archie's seasoned critique. She is the 'recommender of movies', 'maker of plans' and 'booker of tickets' (sometimes gets the theatre wrong but you can't hold that against the Maker) and despite all this, I went ahead and watched the Black Panther even when Archie said that the movie was just average. Could she be wrong? The movie has been setting milestones and is apparently the highest grossing superhero movie.
Though I like the DC comic superheroes better, I prefer watching the Marvel movies. So when Shugz and Hershey asked me if I wanted to watch the movie, I tagged along. 
30 minutes into the movie, I looked at Hershey who looked super engrossed. I waited for 5 more minutes and then hesitatingly asked her if she could understand what was happening. ""Not a clue (or should I say Klaue :D)""she said. 
(NO SPOILERS) Here is the storyline of the movie (I shall refrain from calling it the Plot because the movie lacks one!): The film begins with the 'birth' (figuratively) of the Black Panther and the coming together of the Jabari Tribe to form 'Wakanda'- a nation that portrays itself as a Third World Country to the world, that irrationally refuses foreign aid but is in fact years ahead of its counterparts in technology and refrains from aiding other countries despite having the capacity to do so. 
The source of this technological advancement is Vibranium, a metal available exclusively in Wakanda, that is used in almost everything - fidget spinner like flying saucer, kinetic energy absorbing 'panthersuit', running trains to healing broken vertebrae and turning otherwise gentle rhinos to beasts of war. 
The vibranium falls into the wrong hands, an illegal arms-dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and King T'Chaka's brother (Sterling Brown) is accused of having helped him steal it. 
Post T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) inherits the throne. He is accompanied by his side-kicks, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of his army of bodyguards and his ex-lover, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o)
Klaue steals a Wakandan artefact made of Vibranium from a museum with help from Erik Stevens (Michael Jordan) and plans on selling it to a CIA operative, Everett Ross (Martin Freeman). T'Challa along with Okoye and Nakia head to South Korea to extract the Vibranium before it's sold and also bring back Klaue to Wakanda for justice. The plan goes awry with Klaue escaping, only to be killed later by Erik Stevens.
Erik goes to Wakanda with Klaue's corpse and gains the support of a tribe there and defeats T'Challa in the ritualistic fight for the throne. Skipping the why's and the how's as that would reveal the ""plot"" (for lack of a better word), the story follows with attempts made to restore the rightful heir to the throne. 
Here is why I was disappointed with the movie:
1. Did you see Forest Whitaker mentioned in the storyline above? Well, guess what, he's there in the movie. The movie has an ensemble of brilliant actors but unfortunately they either lack sufficient screen time (Brown and Whitaker) or they aren't ideally suited for the characters being portrayed by them (Freeman and Nyong'o).
2. Many may disagree but Boseman hasn't done complete justice to the role of Black Panther. The character just seems so 'ordinary', there are no quirks that set him apart. 
3. The movie is a hotchpotch of plots. The story seems to have been written along the way, in an attempt to include all that is required to make a Blockbuster Superhero film and then some more.
4. While the actor (Jordan) portraying the role of the villain has made a good attempt, the character of the villain itself is not well-etched. All superhero movies need a Super Villain and Eric Stevens is not intimidating enough. 
5. The dialogues lack in creative ingenuity.
The only time the audience hooted was when Stan Lee made his cameo appearance. 
Thankfully I hear it's a non-sequel movie. It goes to show that the makers of the film too didn't have much confidence in it."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,3/10,"Good things first:
The actors are beautiful and talented. The cast give fantastic performances with the exception of the guy who plays the main baddy who does a so-so job.The CGI is obnoxiously overused, but it looks pretty cool. Similarly the design of the aircraft and the underground part of the city looked super cool.The bad:
Very little in this movie makes sense. The plot is stupid and so many important details were overlooked. For example, why do the super-advanced people fight exclusively with melee weapons? Also, why do they have super advanced weapons and fighter/bomber planes and why do the average citizenry seem to know military tactics (they form a phalanx during the final fight) if they've never been in a single war ever and have only ever hidden from the world???? Why does Black Panther simply have a special suit and magic metal claws? This is supposed to be part of the Marvel universe so Ironman and the Hulk exist in this. What could this guy contribute? He could contribute super advanced and nearly indestructible weaponry (guns/drones/satellites) based on the magic metal. Instead, he's just a tribal cliche in a catsuit... meow.Moreover, there were some REALLY good concepts that were brought up, but never fully examined. For example there were ideas of family, heritage, identity, geopolitics, race and more that were never really examined. Even the main baddy's motivation could have made for a really great story with a REALLY dark twist at the end, but, instead we got the Disney rated G ending which didn't even make any sense."
BLACK PANTHER,1 December 2019,8/10,ü§ß I like to confuse foreigners by making them think wakanda is real
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,7/10,"I had heard that Black Panther was supposed to be excellent so I was excited to see it. I think I can understand, having a movie about Africa that ISN'T about slavery, genocide, apartheid, AIDS, war lords, or child soldiers is kind of unheard of ... and in that light this film is awesome. I applaud the long list of strong female characters present in this film. And they got the freaking A-List for this film, the acting talent was unimpeachable. My issue with this film is the story: they used such a generic and overly used storyline which was DEEPLY disappointing. The plot is just a superhero version of the Lion King which we all know got its plot from Hamlet. It made me feel like a movie I'd already seen 15 times before and that really bummed me out.Meanwhile the film is populated with all these interesting characters and a new country and culture that we never find out much about. Who are the Dora Milaje? How did it come to be that Wakanda is protected by a group of badass bald females? What's with the hand to hand combat to determine the next king? What's the significance of the masks? Why does that mountain tribe worship Hanuman (whose roots are Hindu)? Why is the mountain tribe all trouble-making? What's the deal with the Wakandan spy missions all over the world? What's with the lip tattoos? Why do they glow like that? How do they get them? Are they hereditary or what?Or how about just more history on the relationships between the primary cast? What's the story between T'Challa and Nakia? Was Shuri born a child prodigy or was she trained to be head of technology? What's the deal between Okoye and W'Kabi? Are they lovers? Married? What? And what's T'Challa's relationship with W'Kabi? Did they grow up together? Are they best friends? We're told extremely little about any of these people and we're just supposed to infer everything based on a few random interactions.So I was left not feeling very much for these characters as they jump from action scene to action scene to action scene to ... yawn. Plus, there was nothing new to the action sequences ... and it's just all been done before so many times I got bored. THEN, add to that, I'm not even sure WHEN this movie is supposed to be taking place. During Civil War? After Civil War? Because if it's during Civil War ... like after the father was killed and before Bucky was brought to Wakanda ... then it blows the big is-T'Challa-dead part of the film because we know he has to live to go after Bucky. If it's after Civil War then why did they say in Civil War that T'Challa was king? It's sloppy stuff like this that makes me crazy.And lastly, the film felt tonally off from the other films ... and not in a good way like Thor Ragnarok. It's like this film couldn't decide what tone to take, so it was part storytelling/fantastic/mythology ... then part gritty/urban/dark ... then part glossy/tech-heavy/action flick. If it had just picked ONE of those and stuck with it I probably would've loved it but instead it was a mishmash and didn't do any of them well and left the whole thing feeling off.I give it a 7 because I didn't really dislike the film, and for me even a so-so Marvel film is still way better than most movies Hollywood makes today. But I was disappointed. I wanted better and it's a shame that this film didn't get a richer, unique story to do credit to the acting talent and overall opportunity that existed in the making of this film."
BLACK PANTHER,17 August 2018,8/10,"Wow wow wow ! What I am really seeing on the first few pages of the review thread of this film. So many negative reviews and most of them coming from a viewpoint that the film has been overrated by critics. Seriously ! when you buy a ticket, you never really ask a critic for consideration. Sometimes you enjoy even the worst movie in theater. Judging on the basis of Critics's opinions seems dumb and totally childish. Anyways this is my opinion. I recently watched the film and to be really frank, had not really bothered about the reviews. I would have watched anyway even if they were negative.Like all Marvel Superhero films, Black Panther follows the traditional route of Good Vs Evil but with style and substance. It's not a flawless film. The pace dips many times in between and the editing could have been crisper. The CGI also looks unimpressive at many places. But this film truly belongs to its actors. Each and everyone of them is an absolute marvel on Screen.However, the two actors although very good and performed extremely well didn't leave a lasting Impression I was expecting throughout. Chadwik Boseman (Black Panther) and Letitia Wright (Shuri). The latter's performance has been applauded like crazy and I found her overrated. Don't even understand how she's given more Importance that Okoye and Nokia who were far better etched characters than her. Anyways Micheal Jordan is simply superb as KillMonger. Hope he now has understood that he suits the image of a larger than life supervillian than playing a dumb Johnny Storm in fantastic four series. I also felt they could have avoided Morgan Freeman's Ross character as he barely has much to do. The action sequences, fights are another highlight. The choreography is simply stunning. For me the stars of the show are Danai Gurira as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. Both are extemely brilliant actresses. For the previous, she has such a commanding presence on screen and her dialogue delivery is top-notch. Although she remains tough, she comes alive even in small emotional bits. The Latter nailed the part of Nakia with great balance of vulnerability and emotions. Both the characters stay with you even after the screening has concluded. I really enjoyed the film, although this is not a perfect film by all means, but its a deeply satisfying superhero experience."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,7/10,Chadwick is just great as are the three supporting ladies. The rest of it is unrealistic pretentious balony. How did this make that much $$$.
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,10/10,"This is Wakanda! Don't let us catch you slippin' up! I previously did a review for this movie but it somehow didn't show, so this will be a simplistic yet simple review. This movie was a very well done project. The cinematography and colors are what captured my attention. The acting is good of course, how could it not be with an All-star cast of great actors. Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, and Forest Whitaker are in this movie! The lesser known actors are amazing as well. The music is good, the villain is one of the best, and the story is a nee take on Black Panther's origin. Ryan Coogler is turning into a true visionary, and Chadwick Boseman has played so many iconic Black characters! Good job to all of the cast and crew for a stellar performance! It is quite a journey!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,1/10,"So I've decided to fill my only remaining gap in the MCU franchise, and oh my God, this wreck of a movie is the new absolute low not just for superhero flicks, but for cinema in general.It's just horrible in every conceivable way. The plot is disjointed and stupid, with unbearably tedious dialogues and painfully poor acting. Listening to the dialogues is especially repulsive thanks to the African accents the cast is using, so prepare to hear things like ""pentha (panther)"" and ""teeknoludgee (technology)"". Chadwick Boseman especially excels at this, delivering a performance that perfectly mimics a speech impediment and an astute case of autism. Every other actor is just as cringeworthy, except for Michael B. Jordan (partially) and Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman, coincidentally the only two white actors in this garbage. But the veteran actors' serviceable performances cannot pull this trash out of the abyss.The setting for the movie is also unimaginably ridiculous - apparently there is a technologically advanced African nation hidden in plain sight. However, despite being so advanced, it selfilshly offers no aid to its neighbors, honors ridiculous savage traditions and has its soldiers armed with spears and swords. Thanks, but even a talking raccoon breaks the suspension of disbelief less than this. If ludicrous colorful costumes weren't enough to annihilate the visual aesthetics of the movie, it's also filled with old video game-quality CGI that makes your bleed, so obviously it stands out.But wait, it's an action movie, right, perhaps there are some thrills to be had? Well no Sir, because about 90% of action sequences are done with the same cheap CGI while the remaining 10% are horrendously choreographed with slow unrealistic motions during fights.To add to all this bedlam this film allows itself racist phrases like ""Great, another white boy to heal"". The fact that this mucus gained over a billion at the box office is disgusting and shows how far both Disney and the herds called ""general audiences"" have fallen."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2021,1/10,"Wow I'm baffled at the money this made.... I could not wait til it was over, glad I saw it for free!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 June 2019,9/10,"Black Panther is really good. The story is great, the characters are well written, and Kilmonger is my third favorite MCU villain behind Loki and Thanos. I liked how serious this film actually was as well. However some of the CGI particularly toward the final battle looks HORRIBLE. Some of the CGI looks almost as bad if not worse than the CGI in Justice League. And I didn't like the ""what are those"" joke. But overall, Black Panther is another great MCU film."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,1/10,"It is not necessary to describe anything. This movie was a total nonsense, appalling acting and the worst Marvel movie ever. Nothing absolutely nothing made any sense. The jokes were atrocious, the characters ridiculous. It is simply an insult to the basic instincts and whoever rated this movie more than 4 seriousky need medical attention... immediately. It is clear that the high rankings here are totally paid for. Lame."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,8/10,"Such a full filling aspiration, an achievement of one culture to have and to use it in a positive way, unlike those that sad it for bad. This movie shows how one tribe can live, prosper, and provide if need be. Those that did not understand do not understand culture and it's way of life!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"I liked Black Panther in the Civil War and was excited about this movie. I hoped to see some amazing adventure and action by Black Panther in this movie but what I got was a family power struggle for the throne of a kingdom/country. Many action scenes and a big part of the storyline doesn't even involve the Black Panther with all his powers and abilities. That was a bit disappointing. At the end, I remained thirsty for some Black Panther action involving his powers and abilities. The movie is good in what it's trying to show but I disliked the acting by the mostly Black cast in this movie. That doesn't mean I don't like Black actors; I have admired many times acting by Black actors/actresses. I don't know. Even Daniel Kaluuya whom I liked and appreciated so much in Get Out, seemed like a novice actor in this movie.The end credit video song is awesome in my view and it's worth purchasing the whole movie ticket for. I am not talking about just the song but also the picturization and the way it's perfectly fits and harmonizes with the whole movie."
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2019,10/10,"I watched this film for the first time last night with my husband and we both were blown away:
A. Beautifully filmed
B. Fantastic Story
C. A lot of very strong female characters. THANK YOU
D. Unique, refreshing, funny, exciting, and very moving.
E. Excellent acting. Michael B. Jordon and Leticia Wright were standouts in a truly stellar cast.
F. The first ""Marvel"" film we have seen in a long time that actually made sense. We did not feel like we needed a set of storyboards to help us figure out who all the characters were like the Avengers Films (we stopped after the second one).
H. I would have loved to have seen on the big screen and my husband and I each each bought the Blu ray dvd at the same time and said hey lets watch Black Panther. LOL.
I. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but there are a lot of very negative reviews from the last two months that mention politics, politically driven, and political correctness. We saw none of that: we clearly saw a message of PEACE, FAIRNESS, and INCLUSION.
J. WE LOVED the fantastic world that was created in Wakanda.
K. Thank you Ryan Coogler for doing such a tremendous job with your direction."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2019,8/10,The story is brilliantly borrowed from the comic books. It has a certain flair to it that most single hero stories don't. The visuals are stunning and the music score is on another level.Great movie!!
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,Simply put the special effects were pretty good at times but nothing we haven't seen before. The story was very weak. Some of the character development was good but not enough to save the story. There was no big racial message in it or anything like that. There were some small innuendo's but very limited.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,4/10,"Some people might fight this film enjoyable, like kids maybe? but as I watched it in the cinema, even they were bored most of the time. Could this be my reason for walking out ..well maybe, after all nobody likes noisy people around them whether or large or small whilst trying to pay attention to something, but I can certainly say it wasn't my only reason for walking out. Maybe teenagers are the target audience, or adults gripping to childhood.This among other Marvel and DC releases was as I suspected it would be; An over-animated mess without much sense other than to showboat over-priced CGI, over-done sound effects and over-compensated actors. The only decent aspect in all of this was the incredible wide angle scenic shots that could only look better if I were not to be in a cinema, but in nature properly being in these landscapes myself.There are some neat ideas in the film, but if they're only made tangible by the before-mentioned budget, then this indicates a lack of imagination in viewers since a lot of these ideas like magnetic railways could be made far more common place if only we put our money to better use rather than it going to an over-inflated box office for people to sit in a cinema grazing on fat, salt and sugar to take their mind away from the job and bills they hate so much. This film, not unlike 90% of others gives us a glimpse of what is possible by working together, not without question, but with care & dignity ..unlike the current modalities that have such a grapple hold on our Earth at the moment."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,3/10,"SPOILER: I was told this movie was amazing and Killmonger was a great villain. Killmonger was boring and laughable. He is supposed to be this intelligent black ops soldier but for some reason he just screams out what are supposed to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" phrases and never really says anything of substance. The acting for Killmonger is awful and the actor seems to have just read the lines while he was drunk as their is nothing convincing about the character. Pull anyone off the street and they could rattle off Killmonger's lines in the exact same way: lifeless. What is up with the bad accent? Barely any of the actors are good enough to do this ""African"" accent but they insist on it and it's confusing. Why would a country in Africa that isolates itself and despises colonizers speak only English? They wouldn't. They would speak their own language. The filmmakers should have had the actors speak a native language or speak their regular English with no accent. You can barely understand anything said in that joke of an accent but at least it provides one of the few laughs. Also, in the middle of Africa their is a random snow mountain that is minutes from warm Wakanda? Supposedly the director thought that having an African tribe in the jungle was ""too logical"" or something so he decided to put them on a freezing mountain. That kind of decision making is evident throughout. The director tried to spice things up without realizing the idiocy of it. The director gets in their own way again and again and it's sad because this could have been done well."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,9/10,"While Black Panther is a film that was over-hyped, I do think a majority of its hype was met with excellence. We're looking at a Marvel movie that didn't have its stereotypical humor filled roots and instead, went for a more serious story with breathtaking world-building and a cast that delivers.While this isn't a perfect film, I had very little qualms with it. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was a single joke that felt entirely out of place (you know exactly what I'm talking about, if you've seen it). Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I can't wait to see it again when it comes out on Blu-ray."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,6/10,"Perhaps I am one of the rare breeds who did not see the Movie, at the theatre that is. I don't like crowds. But I did buy the digital movie release of it with the Bonus content. First I will say I will always be proud of the Black Director, Black Producer and the Black Cast. Art, Television, Film, Theatre and Books have always been my first love. This is what I liked about the film. Beautiful Black People on screen from all over the globe. The love T'Challa has for his father, family and country. Some enchanting footage of T'Challa communicating with his deceased father. The portrayal of science, technology, engineering and math. Great costumes by Ruth Carter, great acting by Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, and of course some great music.Although I wanted to really Love Black Panther, it was a bit boring and just okay. In my opinion there was no stellar acting and no great moment in the film. I actually fell asleep on it a few times before I was actually able to watch the whole movie. T'Challa and Nakia had no chemistry exhibited on screen despite the scenes of T'Challa looking at Nakia adoringly or at least an attempt to portray adoringly. It fell flat. The so called jokes were not funny. Shuri playing jokes and laughing at her brother T'Challa were clearly meant to show the friendly sibling banter between brother and sister. I found the jokes mediocre at best. I've seen interviews where Chadwick Boseman explains the way he portrayed T'Challa based upon T'Challa's family background and how T'Challa would carry and conduct himself based on these things. I'll say I agree with his sentiment's. Boseman was chosen for the part and he brought to it what he thought was best. I've seen several of his other movies and the man definitely can act. I've also seen comments about Kilmonger portrayed by Michael B. Jordan being the hero and liked much better than T'Challa. After seeing the movie I can't say I agree with this as I found it to be a bit boring and just ok. I've also seen a few Michael B. Jordan interviews indicating what he did to prepare for the role of Kilmonger. Again Michael B Jordan was given the role of Kilmonger and portrayed him as he saw fit as an professional actor. A movie has so much that goes into constructing it, before, during and after it's made. In
this regard Black Panther is a Winner with stellar backing, support, and marketing. A box office success and I'm happy for them."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,8/10,"Yup. You heard me. I'm not a Marvel Fan. I don't watch movies about superheroes. This is the first Marvel movie I've seen since Green Lantern. And I personally was entertained. Especially the scene with that car scene. However, I would had given this a 10/10, but the accents are just plain bad.If you're a Marvel fan, you'll probably be dissapointed in this one. If you aren't a Marvel fan, I recommend you go see it."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2019,2/10,"This is shining example of trying to promote a black superhero from a point that constantly screams raceisiom.
Just stop please, it has a bad story and worse acting."
BLACK PANTHER,4 November 2019,2/10,"The only two good things in this movie are the CGI & fight scenes, everything else were bad."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2020,6/10,"Firstly let me say this movie is fantastic for what it achieves and for that it fully deserves praise. The problem is once you look beyond that it's really not a great movie and probably one of the weakest in the MCU (along with the first two Thor).The plot itself is very unoriginal, the action scenes much more limited versus other Marvel films and most noticeably there is little humour - often a staple within this universe. I also found myself finding very little chemistry between the main characters but that may just be my take.Overall it's not terrible but lacks a lot of what makes Matvel great once you scratch beneath the surface."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"I came into the theater with high expectations for Black Panther, given it was directed by one of my favorite young and rising directors, Ryan Coogler. Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station and Creed, has proven to be an excellent director for portraying drama and character studies in contemporary settings. With Black Panther, though I had high expectations, I also didn't know what to expect; was Coogler going to do a drama or was he going to stray from his style to fit Marvel Studios' aesthetic?The answer is both, and the result is a unique film that at times feels like a Coogler film and, at other times, feels like a Marvel Studios fantasy.I overall enjoyed Black Panther; it fell short on some aspects in terms of being both a superhero film and a sociopolitical drama, but still manages to hit all the marks.The characters are well-written and lovable, simple as that. A superhero film is only as good as its villain, and Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger is sure to be in the books as one of the stronger Marvel villains in the MCU. The film invests its story into fleshing out the emotional drama and perspective that Killmonger uses to justify his antagonistic actions; for the first time in a long time in the MCU, we sympathize with the ""villain,"" and his viewpoints touches on the social commentary in which the film finds its strengths. Letitia Wright as Shuri also stole the show, both serving as tasteful comedy relief and as a strong supporting character to Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa.The social commentary of this film, which is what I was most looking forward to, is excellent. It's not very explicit and takes some thinking to dissect, and frankly I could spend hours analyzing the metaphors this film produces that connect the fantastic themes present in Wakanda to our real-world issues of marginalization and how the world perceives Third World Countries. Instead, I will say that the social commentary is used as a means to advance the film's plot and retain the central themes; it's like any good Marvel movie that poses a moral question (Winter Soldier, Civil War), only this time it feels more contemporary and more relevant than ever. The themes touch on the power of countries and what responsibility they bear to the world, and particularly focuses on the marginalization and historical oppression of African Americans and poses the question on what can be done to resolve this continuous issue in our society. It's very compelling and is a story that must be told, making Black Panther an excellent addition to Ryan Coogler's dramatic filmography.That said, this film does try to balance between being a dramatic social discussion and a fantastic superhero film, and ultimately that becomes the reason why this film fell flat on certain moments. The action is derivative, CGI-laden, and boring, and this was disappointing given that Creed had simply phenomenal fight sequences and choreography. I will say that the action in Black Panther has the same emotional background and payoff that the fighting in Creed had, but Coogler is still trying to find his footing on how to direct a superhero action sequence, and I think he tried a bit too hard on appealing to comic book fans on this one when it came to the action (too many cutaways, not enough careful focus or emphasis on skilled combat, etc.). There were definitely some action moments I loved (at one point we had a one-shot moment again a la Creed), but there wasn't enough. The film is also grounded in fantasy; few scenes take place in contemporary cities, which I was hoping for more of, but, ultimately, that's personal preference. Wakanda's scenes feel somewhat like the scenes of Asgard in the Thor franchise, so the fantasy aspects can be a bit tiring. To each their own.Overall, Black Panther is definitely the best Marvel film in a while (since, arguably, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) but is certainly not the best. Although riddled with superhero cliches and dialogue, Black Panther's compelling social commentary, strong characters, and an all-around excellent cast make it an excellent addition to both Coogler's filmography as well as the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther may not be the first leading African American star in a superhero movie but it by far one of the most impactful and memorable ones to ever come out and exist. Black Panther picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War following Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) and the rise of a new king and the struggles that come from the responsibilities of it. Performance wise everyone did a flawless job, between the accents of the Wakanda people to the beautiful, Blade Runner like city designed to the artistic fight scenes and tightly written dialogue creates a movie worth watching. Every character, even Stan Lee with his famous cameo, just come off with such power and leaves the viewers with such impact and lots to think about from each line of dialogue delivered. Both Boseman and Jordan make the ranks of fans and critics favorite characters in the MCU to date along side with the array of supporting actors (Freeman, Gurira, Nyong'o, Whitaker, Kaluuya, and Serkis). Action wise this movie is visually stunning. With Coogler transferring his use of beautiful follow cams from Creed and using the same Cinematographers from Creed and Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle to choreograph the fights and film them so flawlessly and beautifully makes Black Panther one of the best action movies of the year by far. Special Effects look beautiful with the Kinetic Suits and the Vibranium infused weapons used by the Wakanda warriors and Boseman. Each site of the city gets more and more beautiful with its subtle yet so appealing to the eyes. By far my favorite was the kinetic energy used when the Black Panther suit was charged up. Ryan Coogler gave it his all with Black Panther and didn't hold back a single bit with is beautifully written film that was directed so perfectly. I was a fan when I saw his work with Jordan on Fruitvale Station back in 2014 and loved his work even more with yet again Jordan in Creed and how Coogler has cemented himself in with the MCU as being one of the best directors working to date. My overall Score for the film has to be a 9.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"This movie entertained me for two hours and exactly that was my expectation. Marvel movies arent doing anything spectacularly cool anymore, but they deliver on action and effects. I feel though, as that CGI could use another leap forward in technology. I am starting to get too used to it and spotting it is getting easier and easier and that just takes one out of the immersion.About the ""controversy"": I think those groups that hype the movie for their black background are equally annoying as those that bash it for the overhype. But good for Marvel both groups generate more attention for the movie. Well done, folks!Overall: I had fun eating popcorn to this"
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2018,8/10,"An easy watch, would highly recommend, doesn't warrant any bad reviews."
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2019,5/10,"There is no denying that Black Panther is an extremely important film, being a mainstream superhero movie with a mostly black cast that has good things to say. However, this does not excuse it from the major problems it contains.I have never been so thoroughly able to predict the plot of a movie before. This is not to say that most Marvel movies don't have predictable plots, but with this one, it is more blatantly obvious than any other in the series. It is also not aided by the fact that it has a boring protagonist in a movie where every other character is more interesting than he is. Because he has no real enticement as the lead, it quickly reveals the other problems more readily than other Marvel movies as you are paying more attention to them.The only part of this film that really deserves the praise it got is Killmonger. He is a great villain, the most interesting character in the movie, and has some really worthy things to say. But he cannot save the entire movie, which is so generally mediocre. It's no doubt an important movie, but that does not mean it doesn't have problems."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is a great movie with an excellent storyline. Each is entitled to their own opinion, but I am curious regarding the real agenda of those who are rating it with low scores. The movie is no more political or controversial than any other movie shown in a theater over the last half century. The dialog is often thought provoking and may generate some discussion because it acknowledges some of the world's social issues. It is action-packed and mostly family friendly. The fight scenes are typical for super hero films and the CGI is pretty good. Women and many other minorities have significant screen time and major roles in the development of the plot. The lead actors stars give the supporting cast room to share the spotlight. I highly recommend all DC and Marvel fans to see this movie and incorporate it into the debates and discussions about super heroes and villains. I expect many of these stars to show up again on the silver screen soon."
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2019,3/10,"Deep down within Black Panther lies a great movie with a great message. Emphasis on the deep down, cause what we actually got is one of the most disappointing MCU movies ever. Where to begin with this! I'll start with the few things i liked. The score is nothing great and i personally much prefer original scores to just songs pilled together but still it's better than regular MCU ones. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Killmonger (easily the best performance in the movie) and the directing and scenary is preety good and the costumes are nice as well (i much prefered the Civil War suit but whatever)! However, the negative outweigh the positive by a lot! The plot is as generic as humanly possible. Nothing more than *evil relative takes throne, hero takes it back* . Nothing new, nothing interesting and as predictable as possible (unless there was a person who thought Black Panther actually died midway through the movie)(also plot makes zero sense at all but its a Marvel movie so I'll allow it). Acting apart from Jordan is just ok, and some characters are extremely annoying (looking at you Shuri). The humour is also extremely mediocre and tries to pull off jokes that would have been considered funny 2 years ago (ahem, what are those) and i personally didn't laugh once. But those are just nitpicks compared to the 3 main problems! 1. Black Panther is too overpowered. He already was bulletproof, super strong, super fast and an expert martial artist. Did you really have to include the whole blast thing? That problem is prevalent with a lot of heroes but when he is so overpowered any sense of suspense is immediately lost. 2. The CGI is shockingly bad! One of the worst of all MCU movies! Like it certainly has some very nice shots but his animated suit is very poorly animated and the car chase and especially the final battle are hilariously bad in terms of CGI (literally looking like a PS2 game at times!). 3. Speaking of the final battle, the action is quite possibly the worst in any MCU film. Apart from the ok waterfall fight scenes, the first one is too dark to see anything, the car chase is ridiculous at best and the final battle is embarrassingly bad, in terms of logic, CGI, suspense... it fails at everything (once again a mediocre hero vs villain with exact samw powers final fight)! All in all this movie is a mess and it feels like it briefly took Marvel back to the early MCU. Unfortunately disappointing is the best i can say about it. 3/10 (Keep in mind i rate this movie solely as what i like and dislike about it as a movie! I am not reviewing it for its cultural effect or anything else in this review)"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,3/10,"A pattern is shown in the marvel movies now. all heros are getting an iron man suit but made for the hero they are, spider man get a spider suit full with tech, Black panther does too and they are just like iron man but with a other abilities.I am getting fed up with these movies. When we read these magazines it was for the great stories, now its just senseless action with no brainer script, its made for kids who are about enter the puberty, for them these movies are amazing, But marvel is truly and utterly destroying their good rep with junk like this."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"For far too long, Marvel Studios' PR department has been waging a sustained assault on us patrons' psyche with over-the-top promotional material, ranging from comic conventions, merchandising, endless trailers/previews and cultural references. Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: ""It is tough for a good man to be a leader"". And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table. As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2019,4/10,"Andy Sirkis is really good and the lead actor who plays black panther is also very good but man, the screenplay sucks. It's so boring. Also they may have been better off having an African director (not American) as it is cringe watching this almost racist depiction of what Americans think Africa should be like."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,8/10,"This is the part where the pasty white guy says something dangerously close to: ""There's no way I could be racist. I have a black friend.""So growing up in Brooklyn, some of my better friends have lived their lives constantly effected by the remnants of institutionalized racism and racism in general. And denying that racism has infected all walks of life, including Hollywood, and continues to do so, is to be perpetuating a fallacy. You need to have some bulletproof blinders on in order to believe anything else. Under-representation of black culture and whitewashing is an easily traceable pattern in Hollywood. Multiple black actors is a rare sight in a film, unless the film is about sports or slavery. I agree that the overly PC culture we live in can go too far in it's demands for ""social justice"" and in it's outrage where it isn't truly warranted, but facts are facts and the annoying nature of some ""SJWs"" doesn't alter said facts.Now, as a middle class white man who grew up seeing racial injustice but never truly living through it, I found the idea of a Marvel super hero movie set in Africa and consisting nearly entirely of black main and supporting actors refreshing and interesting. However, for my friends it was far more than that. It was a source of pride and extreme emotional investment. Even now just looking at their Facebook wall you would see the positive impact that the very existence of this film has on their lives and continues to do so. And that's a beautiful thing. I want every movie I watch to have that effect on me and am thrilled when a movie, even one I don't personally like, has that effect on anyone.However, that emotional impact, those Facebook posts, the glowing reviews and everything else surrounding this film's release, as happy as it made me for people I care about, is the exact reason I waited a little bit to watch it. Because this movie had all the hype in the universe, and hype culture is a terrible thing with no true benefit to any moviegoer. If you hype yourself into thinking a movie's going to be a 10, and it's a 9, you will be disappointed. If you go in thinking it will be a 5, and it's a 6, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I had to go back into ""5"" mode before I decided to see this.So I managed to go into this film with weathered expectations and a constant mind to the things I typically don't like about Marvel films, instead of the hype. Even though I love the idea of this film and am happy that it's an overwhelming triumph financially, none of it mattered to me if it didn't succeed as a film on it's own merits.It did.The movie has the three main problems that I have with all Marvel movies: too long, CGI porn and containing bad one liners that take the drama away from a scene. However this movie was one of the lesser offenders in the MCU in those regards. There's only one or two of the lame drama-cutting jokes (and although this joke wasn't of that variety, any ""what are those"" jokes deserve to rot in the deepest circle of hell). To boot, although the movie felt a tiny bit long, looking back I can't think of any particular thing that could have been cut. I originally thought the Oakland stuff could have been cut, but they paid that stuff off in a big way at the end. I originally though the ""challenge"" scene didn't need to be there, but it served as a lesson in a Wakandan culture and provided context to later events, so no problem there. Ultimately I can't complain too much about the length. And it's a Marvel movie so CGI porn is CGI porn and it's there and there can't be much done about it. However the warrior culture and natural backdrops of Wakanda make for much more clear and enjoyable battle scenes overall.The story here is simple but effective: T'Challa is a new King after the death of his father. With the changing landscape of the world, the discovery of a stolen artifact and the eventual arrival of Killmonger, he is emburdened with the question of whether Wakanda's technology should be shared with the world, a new threat and the realization of his father's greatest failing. The movie is paced well, makes sense, is greatly performed, the score is excellent and best of all the isolationist nature of Wakanda meant the film wasn't burdened with gratuitous references to other Marvel movies, much like how the setting of Wonder Woman worked in it's favor.I knew Chadwick Boseman was a great actor and an excellent Black Panther after his previous turn as him in Civil War, but whether he could carry the main duties in a film was yet to be seen, and he was great here. Emotional yet powerful, serious yet charismatic, and believable. He has great chemistry with all of his co-stars and really fits the bill as a leading man. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger continues to check marks on his rise to superstardom, creating something as rare as a unicorn: a compelling villain in a Marvel movie. His upbringing is laid bare and it makes his pain, anger and motivation completely understandable. He isn't trying to take over Wakanda because ""I'm the antagonist""; he's doing so because he wants both revenge on the world, and in his own mind, to save it. In the context of the film, you definitely feel for him. Also as a child raised in Oakland California in the 90s, his juxtaposition with the African people of Wakanda makes for an intriguing contrast.The supporting cast members are all noteworthy in their own right. I especially enjoyed Letitia Wright as Shuri. She was the funniest castmember, often quick with a one-liner that lands, and never obnoxiously so save for that ""what are those"" travesty. She never felt like a caricature or a stock ""funny"" character. Just a witty character with a sense of humor. Later in the film, when she had to be serious, she was.In the end, even ignoring the poison to balanced expectations that is hype culture, what you have with Black Panther it a well-paced, well-acted and well-told story and a bona-fide standout among Marvel movies, limiting the little annoyances that plague most of them. If there is an extra emotional element to you personally, even better."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,5/10,"This is not a good film. The plot is dull and predictable. The fight scenes are all over the place. Almost, but not quite, as bad as Daredevil"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"I left the theater with mixed feelings. Although the special effects were great, the story was just another cookie cutter Marvel version of yet another superhero with really no fresh ideas or design. On top of that, the action was just average or the same to any other previous Marvel movies. I'm sorry but it didn't blow me out of the water. The hype was just that, all hype. Even Michael B. Jordan could not save this movie from the dull and monotonous of the plot. And I wanted to like this movie so much! But it failed in so many ways. I left feeling so disappointed!"
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,4/10,"I wanted to love this movie but left the theater feeling ""meh"". It started out promising and lively but then got boring in the middle. Just something about it wasn't as exciting towards the middle to end of movie. Unfortunately, most of it was surprisingly predictable as well. The bad guy didn't sell it for me either. I was confused as to whether he was supposed to be fearsome or admirable, or both, but I felt neither. I guess he was supposed to elicit some type of empathy from the audience or something, but his story was sort of weak and didn't seem the least bit genuine. So in essence, wanted to love this movie but don't."
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,10/10,"This movie is everything you want it to be. Great cast, great story line, great cinematography and great action! Black Panther is by far the best Marvel movie made to date. Everyone has their own personal perception on how they believe a movie should be put together but remember, everyone has an opinion and that's all they are. Don't take the hype from me, check it out yourself!"
BLACK PANTHER,21 August 2018,10/10,"Black panther is the most amazing mcu film yet as teaches the audience about culture,honor, helping others."
BLACK PANTHER,4 February 2019,1/10,"I was so looking forward to it, so maybe this is why the disappointment seemed greater. The story is quite interesting, long lost child seeks to reclaim the throne, but the rest is a mess. The mixture of technology and traditon is simply stupid, all combat scenes are beyond ridiculous, and the acting, especially all the fake accents, is nauseating, especially after seeing the actors in other roles, in which they were great (the little sister, for instance, she is unwatchable in Black Panther but really good in Top Boy). All in all, waste of time and need not to be watched in order to understand the whole series"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Ever since I was a kid and watched Marvel animated shows on Saturday mornings, one of my favorite Marvel Superheroes on The Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes was Black Panther.For a long time after the success of The Avengers in 2012,I waited to see what the live action movie theater version of Black Panther would look like on the big screen.And in 2016 when the movie Captain America:Civil War was released,Black Panther made his first onscreen appearance and he was played by one of my favorite actors; Chadwick Boseman. And just like the avengers animated show,Black Panther was one of my favorite characters in the movie. And I am glad I saw the movie Black Panther during the opening weekend,because the movie helped make the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also introduced really cool characters in the movie, like Okoye played by Danai Gurira,M'Baku played by Winston Duke, Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o,Shuri played by Letitia Wright, and N'Jadaka/Eric"" Killmonger"" Stevens played by Michael B. Jordan."
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2018,5/10,"I really had high hopes considering the media coverage and IMDb rating.
I rate it 5 stars for the anti racism message but in terms of acting and story line, it is a 2 star for me."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,3/10,"No need jto watch just another time media tries to give out a helping hand to some that cant achieve on there own. There are great black actors we have seen time and time again. Marvel should try them, because these were not worth the hype. I would of fired the casting director for who they chose or fired the screen writer for now writing a better screen play that the actors could follow."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,4/10,"This movie might deserve more than a 4 (probably not) but I'm harsh because of the 7.8 it clearly doesn't deserve.The movie was a bland origin hero story. It had so much more potential, they decided to play it safe. Acting and cast: I thought the cast was pretty interesting! I do like the king, his ""evil"" cousin and some other people (that guy who played in black mirror, bike episode), they seem to have potential and charisma. Buuuut they had horrible lines and flat one sided roles. A good thing this movie did is open our eyes on some actors that will rise in the future. But probably not in a Black panther 2, marvel isn't good at that (Iron man 2 ewwww... Thor 2 yurk...)CGI and effects: well, there goes your expectations. Since Iron man 1, I've always been shocked by how realistic the CGI looks. Even in the avengers, Iron man and his buddy look so real and physically present. In this movie, it's gone. The CGI is on a DC movie level (I love DC but their CGI.... urrr). Every shot smells green screen, every fight and flying ship scene looks like a game cinematic. Very bad. 
Again, so much potential from African landscapes... wasted behind an obvious green screen for 2h straight.Music... is forgettable. I remember the first time I heard the avenger's theme. Well, I will never remember the soundtrack of this movie. Plot and dialogues. Zero surprises. Good guy, bad guy, bad guy kicks good guy's ass, good guy get his powers back and win the second fight.. the end. Clearly the movie was over hyped by the black cast thing. The movie is, literally just Thor, but black. Don't believe me? Okay, hear this: the prince of a hidden kingdom has to prove he is worthy of his superpowers in order to become king and has to fight his evil sibling. Black Panther or Thor?"
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2018,6/10,"Everyone was talking about this movie being the second coming of Jesus, that cinema would never be the same but all I saw was a typical Marvel movie, nothing more. However was enjoyable (like most marvel movies) and would recommend people to watch"
BLACK PANTHER,2 September 2018,2/10,"Honestly, I can't believe the amount of hype surrounding this movie.. I absolutely hated every second watching this with its headache-inducing CGI, awful story, terrible acting and uninteresting characters.. the only reason I continued watching it to the end was because the events are usually connected across other MCU movies, it was like a pill I had to swallow.."
BLACK PANTHER,23 July 2018,2/10,"I am a big Marvel fan, but to my regret it is the first time I have to say that this was a horrible movie. It started promising but turned out to be a disappointment. I think Marvel is trying to become political correct. Don't do that!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 January 2019,5/10,This is like a black comedy without the comedy. Instead of comedy it's action. It's like where's Walley but without Walley. Instead of Walley there's Martin Freeman.
BLACK PANTHER,4 January 2020,5/10,"Boring story with no logic or intelligence, nice visuals"
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,6/10,Overall its a bit disappointing and the story isn't very believable. The lead villlian is a bit of a caricature who lacks any real motivation other than being a resentful child with daddy issues. One of the most annoying aspects for me is that the fight choreography is generally quite poor. Unforigiveable for a film like this! Super quick editing and super close camera work make fight scenes impossible to follow. The final 'big fight scene' between the 2 panthers is just by the numbers genericness and quite possibly completely CGI. The actresses/characters who play the tough and loyal General and Black panthers technological genius sister are the most interesting and unique in the film. While the actor who plays the Black Panther just about carries it off. One of the most interesting aspect of the film is the idea of Wakanda. A futuristic city hidden in the middle of Africa. Its a nice idea and kind of joyous celebration of African culture and uniqueness. Though one might object to the fairly incongruent mash of traditional tribal stereotypes and futuristic technology. It's not overly believable. But it is a sci-fi fantasy after all. Overall I'd say it's one of the weaker Marvel superhero films but still entertaining enough if you can forgive some of the sillier African stereotypes.
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2019,4/10,An overrated movie from critics with cheap set-design and minor plot to follow. Good for younger audiences that like only action but fails to deliver in many aspects...
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,8/10,"Great science fiction plus marvel movie in one. Very meaningful with epic theme of truth only prevails and even family comes next to justice. liked it a lot. Even though majority of the actors where non white there was no indication of any type of racial discourse, tension or indifference. True to the utopic theme of the 1st part of this trilogy. Cannot wait for the next two releases and more. came out feeling my money's worth and soul cleared and calm."
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2018,3/10,"Hollywood continuing to do nothing for Black inclusion within society.
Why couldn't they just make a black super hero movie without sprinkling a good amount of anti-white racism in.
Hollywood thinking that the only way to embrace black culture is to bow to the old chip on the shoulder mentality far too prevalent within the black communities of the USA. A good opportunity missed I feel.
3 Stars for the eye candy."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,5/10,"I have no idea how modern cinematography works. This movie made a goddamn fortune on bad script, bad CGI, bad directing, bad acting... I mean, I'm so lost in contemporary cinematography right now. Are the people dumb who watch this or what...I just don't get it. I like Marvel, and their movies are sometimes fun to relax and all that, with no brain action on the viewer, but damn some of their movies are really rubbish. I managed to watch 40 minutes of this movie, thats 30 min too much in my honest opinion.
You can tell if a movie will be good in the first 10 min.
I found this one to be ridiculous, i actually giggled at couple scenes that are supposed to be dramatic... I don't know.. Maybe it's me."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2018,1/10,"What. Did. I. Just. Waste. My. Time. On????? Macbeth but with no acting. It's a shame, it had potential. It alarms me that it was so popular...did teens just see it over and over? Or are people just so stupid now that they think this is quality?"
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2019,10/10,One of the best Super Hero Films. Without a Doubt amazing.Haters are just pathetic.
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,4/10,"The critics seem to rave about this so I gave it a go. To start with it seemed not to bad at all, but after 40 long minutes I lost interest in the characters and got bored with the all action but limited storyline. I only laste 20 minutes with kingsman 2 so this was a slight improvement.
Aimed at 13 year olds as most of this genre usually are."
BLACK PANTHER,29 December 2018,8/10,"Few predicted the level to which Marvel's Black Panther would become a cultural phenomenon. Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the MCU received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, as well as breaking an impressive $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Perhaps key to the success of Black Panther is the way that it thrills both fans of the superhero flick but also transcends the usual bounds of the genre, in its characters, design and themes. This is a film that subverts the typical Marvel formula, something which is long overdue.
Chadwick Boseman comfortably leads the film as the eponymous hero, venerable monarch by day and suit-sporting vigilante by night. T'Challa rules the nation of Wakanda, a futuristic and technologically advanced utopia shielded by a mask as a third-world nation. T'Challa's ex-lover, Nakia (played on expected brilliant form by Lupita Nyong'o) fights the case for Wakanda's moral duty to share the truth of their wealth; this is one of many surprisingly complex questions which weave their way satisfyingly into the narrative. Taking this even further is the film's villain, Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan isolated from the kingdom, calling for a revolution by black people against their oppressors. Michael B. Jordan is a charismatic villain, wonderful shades of humanity embedded within his performance, providing a fitting and scarily relatable foe for the Black Panther. A spunky ensemble (though prone to spouting exposition) completes the mix, Letitia Wright's Shuri acting as the Q to T'Challa's Bond and Martin Freeman delightfully Watson-esque as an obliging CIA agent.
For the most part, Black Panther is a stunning movie to witness, embracing its Afro-futurism with a colourful and vibrant design. The film feels very much buried in its cultural roots, which gives some understanding to the film's significance. Ludwig Goransson provides a luscious and innovative score and rap numbers courtesy of Kendrick Lamar complement the action.
The action sequences in the movie are also riveting; ""I never freeze"" pronounces T'Challa coolly in an early scene... and neither does the film itself. Pace never lags in relentless and sharp action sequences, gripping the audiences to their seats and, at some points, providing a strong emotional pay-off. The final act is certainly where the film is at its most disappointing, descending into an increasingly loud and banal CGI-fest, which, whilst not uncommon in a Marvel flick, is certainly beneath the calibre of Black Panther. Visual effects are also dodgy at certain instances, oddly plasticky and unfinished-looking. For the most part, however, Black Panther delivers soundly for popcorn moviegoers, never allowing its themes and cultural statements to overtake the pure entertainment.
One only has to see Black Panther to understand the reasons behind its sensation and the whisper of Oscars floating around. Ryan Coogler has crafted a visually staggering blockbuster, which manages to tell an engrossing story, with plenty of popcorn thrills, yet also a remarkably deep cultural message that boasts great relevance. Black Panther is without a doubt one of the most exciting and inventive Marvel outings yet."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2019,1/10,"This is a movie you will like watching it the first time because everyone else is jumping on the band wagon. Many months later, your subconscious tells you this movie was completely overrated and a complete and utter waste of time. Watch it once, but it lacks the charm of other Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,2 August 2018,8/10,"The origin story of the prince of Wakanda absolutely reach the hype of the franchise.Very good combination of the modern and traditional, good plot, nice action and awesome villains(Michael B.Jordan was impressive and Andy Serkis was so cool).It has a lot of CGI effects, but the film screenplay and the plot was so goodwritten, so it was a very good start for the Black panther and his introduce in MCU was absolutely successful."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2019,4/10,"You can praise this film however much you want for it's predominantly black cast and behind the scenes crew which is definitely good for films to have, there is not enough black representation in the film industry. However judging the film on the basis of film criticism Black Panther really starts to fall apart.The biggest problem with this film isn't that it's too long, no, just that it's exciting sequences (primarily the action scenes) are spread throughout the runtime very poorly which leads to the film coming off as slow and boring. This is a very common issue within many films, however it is usually fixed by making the plot and characters engaging to watch. This is where Black Panther fails, none of the characters resonated to me very well, the villain's story is much more compelling then hero's story. It is worth mentioning though that the action sequences were by far the most entertaining sections of the film specifically the one set in South-Korea which was the peak of the film in my opinion.At some points Black Panther's CGI was brilliant and helped massively to expand the world however at other times the CGI was laughable which was best displayed in the final action sequence which looked awful. In summary the ratio of good and bad aspects of this film seems unbalanced which concludes me to say I do not recommend this film."
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2019,7/10,"I very nearly didn't watch this, because it had been so hyped for being the first all-black super-hero movie. I simply assumed it was being given high ratings by the black audience just out of loyalty, but I was wrong. It was refreshingly good, and very unusual. For a change it had some story and characters you could feel some sympathy with and, for a wonder, fight sequences that weren't just there to make fodder for the spin off video games. Ironically, I found it a bit racist, with its overly 'happy peasants in their wonderful country' vibe. Why should an African culture evolve to still keep peasant farmers and straw huts when every other culture that gets technological advances leaves that behind? Also, just taking spears and other primitive weapons and making them advanced also smacked of racism (they'd be far more likely to just adopt and advance guns) but these little quibbles aside I enjoyed it. I even teared up when the villain died - that NEVER happens in super-hero movies simply because the villain never really has complexity or anything to sympathise with. Great turn from Andy Serkis too and all the leads did their job well. Overall, it held my interest and I enjoyed it, and I don't often say that about a Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2021,9/10,"Now, I do not understand the hate on this movie. It had a brilliant soundtrack, and Michael B. Jordan's villain was downright incredible. I think killmonger gives the joker a run for his money, all thanks to Jordan's incredible performance. The other performances range from good to okay, but Marvel beautifully managed to provide a good message with brilliant storytelling. It's a solid, fun, entertaining action movie, and I will always come back to this one to watch again."
BLACK PANTHER,19 September 2021,7/10,"I really liked this movie! The sense of family, the action & the fact that it talked about real issues in our world today while keeping a sense of fiction."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,3/10,"This film made tons of money, was praised by a lot of people so I was expecting another home run from Marvel, but boy was I wrong. I am a big fan of Marvels work, always catch their films, and am usually entertained everytime, but this film didn't deliver as I hoped.The main character Black Panther doesn't have many likeable traits, charisma or anything fun about him, he seems very dull and by the books. The best part about this film was Andy Serkis, should of gotten more screen time. Black Panthers sister was good as well, a funny charismatic character.The film is rushed, has average fight scenes, very limited humor, no drama and overall a bust.Do not recommend. A lot of IMDBs bad reviews on this are correct, should of listened."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,9/10,"After my sixth, or maybe it is my seventh viewing of Black Panther, I am finally ready to review it (Don't judge me-I tend to demonstrate compulsive behavior towards the movies I love). So if you have not seen it, I will not spoil it for you, but I also won't hold back my enthusiasm for the first big-budget film with actors predominately of African descent and Marvel's first Black black superhero.
When Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of Black Panther debuted in Captain America: Civil War, I knew something special was on the horizon from Marvel, but I did not know just how special it would be as a film. The fandemonium had reached epic levels: people were dressing up for the movie, there were social media campaigns to bring kids to the theaters in groups, and my community was creating all kinds of badass dance challenges on YouTube to celebrate the film's release. So part of the reason I needed to see it so many times was to ensure that the hype and enthusiasm I was experiencing in my community had not robbed me of the experience of appreciating all the craftsmanship that went into this movie. Marvel intended for it to be big-thus the $200 million dollar investment-but they could have never anticipated a reaction like this. I also needed to be sure this film stood up under scrutiny after multiple viewings because I knew I was already on a cultural high that would bias my review. So by my fourth viewing, the hype had waned for me, and now I was evaluating Black Panther for what it was-one of Marvel's most poignant and influential films in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Yes, some people still don't know what that is.The film opens with a bedtime storytelling of the history of Wakanda that catches the audience up to speed on everything in less than two minutes. Can someone please share this storytelling method with every studio exec who feels the urge to bore us to death with more origin stories? Please, and thank-you. The film picks up right after the events of Civil War with T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) seeking out his ex who's on an undercover operation saving hostages, only to use the opportunity to invite her to his coronation as king. How smooth is that? Using your inauguration to get the girl. Well, the funny part is, as fierce as T'Challa is on the battlefield, he is softer than a marshmallow soaking in hot chocolate around the woman he loves, i.e., Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o). It is little weaknesses like this that help establish T'Challa's humanity and his impending burdens as king. As said in the multitude of trailers, he is ""a good man, with a good heart, and it is hard for a good man to be king."" Moreover, T'Challa will learn that lesson the hard way. When an old Wakandan adversary-Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up with an unknown black-ops soldier named Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), everything accelerates into a battle for the throne and the fate of society at large. As a Michael B. Jordan fan, seeing him decked out in tribal scaring and challenging everything T'Challa stood for, much in the way Malcolm X challenged Martin Luther King-was a cinematic feast like no other. Jordan's portrayal of the controversial Killmonger character manages to not only seduce you intellectually and but enthrall you emotionally. And Jordan's performance places Killmonger-a terrible character in comics-among the best on-screen villians in the MCU.Black Panther is that rare superhero movie that manages to take on challenging social themes of race, the diaspora of black Americans, immigration, isolationism, and retribution for oppression, all without isolating any particular group. It manages to be both provocative and smart about its messaging without becoming condescending and heavy-handed. As an action film, Black Panther plays more like a spy film than a comic-book movie, much in the same manner as Captain America: Winter Soldier worked more on the level with a Jason Bourne-like thriller. What Black Panther lacks in bombastic action, it more than makes up for it with strong story-telling, establishing a beautiful new cinematic world, savvy action sequences, and phenomenal performances. Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Winston Duke as the compelling and hilarious M'Baku, and Letitia Wright as Shuri (the scene-stealing tech-guru of Wakanda that'll give Tony Stark a run for his money) all manage to provide depth and heart to this fictional world in a way that takes most films multiple sequels to achieve. Black Panther's attributes far outweigh its occasionally choppy CGI and accelerated third act which is my only complaints. Ryan Coogler manages to create such a compelling world that this 2-hr and 20-minute film (which is long by any action film standard) never quite feels long enough. Wakanda is such a marvel to look at that you will want to explore it beyond the capital city, rural areas, and marketplace settings we are limited too. Maybe Avengers: Infinity War will give us a bigger bite of the Wakanda pie before Thanos arrives.Black Panther works as a standalone film-connected to the larger MCU by Agent Ross, Klaue and a surprise character in the post-credit scene. A compelling script is what happens when the MCU grows up and recognizes that there is a bigger world out there. It is diverse. It is beautiful. Moreover, it is full of engaging human stories waiting to be wrapped in the blanket of fantasy to tell the type of universal stories that only good science fiction can tell. Black Panther takes the MCU into new territory: a world where heroes can emerge from parts of the world that are often ignored in America. It also takes the MCU in a much smarter direction without ever losing what made the MCU so special in the first place-fun and fantasy. If anything, Ryan Coogler's fantastic direction of Black Panther has just expanded the world, much in the way King T'Challa hopes to-eliminating the day where a black superhero is a rare event."
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,4/10,"This movie is terribly cliche, predictable and downright boring."
BLACK PANTHER,6 February 2019,3/10,I am 71 years old so maybe Hollywood has just passed me by but I cannot remember the last movie I saw that disappointed me as much as this one. The plot was arguably impossible to follow. there seemed to be no heroic figures and the futility of all of the battling amongst the parties did not even come close to putting an end to it. It was simply one battle scene after another. The special effects and photography were pretty good but this looked like a two and a half hour audition for assistant director to me.
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2018,2/10,My biggest problem with 'Black Panther' is that it's far far FAR too long and very very VERY boring.
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,10/10,"This movie was Awesome! 10/10 don't read all the awful comments below. Haters are always going to hate. For crying out loud, just give credit where credit is due. Didn't see any of you losers complaint about the last Thor movie. That movie was a joke..."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a visually delightful movie. The story is nicely told, if predictable (though the sub-plot about the American-born prince added an interesting layer). It's right out of the Marvel Universe formula, with a strong, flawed lead character, endearing supporting characters and obligatory villain bent on doing evil. My new favorite is the king's tech wizard sister Shuri. The costumes were wonderful and I like the way they interspersed actual African language (Xhosa) in the film. It is unusual to have a movie with many dark skinned black people playing positive roles, and this movie was ground breaking in that respect. Some of the CGI in the action scenes was over the top, though we've come to expect that in Marvel films.On the whole, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Universe. I look forward to seeing him and some of his Wakandans in upcoming films."
BLACK PANTHER,13 July 2020,3/10,This is a movie that will only be interesting to 9 year olds. If you're older than 9 feel free to skip this childish and boring movie.
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,5/10,"Black panther's reception from the audience and critics seems to be more focused on the 'representation of black people"" than the actual movie. And before going deeper in the review, I want to respond to the ""black representation"" overhyping the movie. Since a lot of people praise the movie for positive portrayal of the black race, as if its the only AND first one to do so, have people forgot about previous movies that portray black heroism? Hidden figures, mandela, long way to freedom, shaka zulu, get on up, 42? How about south African art cinema to appreciate and know the real culture? Nope? Just a mediocre superhero movie? Do people want to stay away from the African culture and act like black panther is the real deal? It doesn't even reflect Africa except in the most superficial ways (costumes, traditions etc). Now I have nothing against African culture of course, but people should stop treating this as some sort of a savior for the black people. A super technologically advanced FICTIONAL African country won't help save anyone. Its just fantasy empowerment, nothing else. Now that I have rambled enough, It's time to talk about the movie itself: The movie by no means is bad, but its not great as critics say imo. It lacks depth and interesting layers. It lacks emotional investment like let's say winter soldier, logan and iron man. I simply don't care about the story or the characters. They fall flat and one note that I become bored, save for few characters (Killmonger, Shuri) despite the cast doing the best they could. Chadewick Boseman, Michael B Jordan and the rest of the cast are all perfect choices and they do their best to make the characters engaging, but only Michael B Jordan succeeds the most out of them. The movie in the first act suffers from boring exposition and poor characterization, where it simply introduces these characters and the world of Wakanda but its not very interesting until the ritual and fighting begins. (Although Killmonger's backstory contains interesting points. Speaking of killmonger, he is easily the best character in the movie. He is interesting, you sympathize with his ideals even though his methods are questionable. He's a great villain who is a good challenge to the king The cinematography and CGI in this movie can sometimes be good, but other times it can be horrible. The best bits of it are in the hand to hand combat on the mountains, the ritual scenes etc. Other times it feels bad like the car chase scene where it lacks levity, creativity and erotic actions sequences. It becomes even worse in the third act, with the rhinos, and the train fight scene, which yes is as bad as people say. In fact, it looks straight out of a ps2 video game. Overall, the movie is not bad, but its also not great. Would I recommend it? Mostly to the MCU fans and those who love black panther, but its not a great movie. It lacks depth and interesting drama."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"Black panther is the demonstration that if Marvel wants to deliver frames without so much humor it can do it, undoubtedly one of the best movies of super heroes, by not trying to be a film of origin and not being the prelude to Infinity war that is, he found a perfect balance as an individual film and connected to his cinematographic universe his director Ryan Coogler is noted that he knows how to make great stories and that let him tell it his way is to applaud, the cast is great from Chadwick Boseman as the black panther, Michael B Jordan as a truly intimidating antagonist, Lupita Nyong'o great actress, even the little or much that Andy Serkis plays is appreciated, the score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is impressive since it is rare to see that they dedicate more to the soundtrack than songs that is to admire and applaud (I appreciate that it was not pure rap, not because I do not like it but it is a very common cliche) and the picture of Rachel Morrison is truly spectacular, the only thing I could say that it is the CGI that there are certain sequences that are not as solid as the plot base, in conclusion it is a solid and entertaining film that shows that well-balanced humor with action and an interesting plot can make a big difference, this movie feels like 2 tapes, on the one hand the heroic and full of action and on the other hand the serious and political issues within your world"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"'Black Panther' is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa aka Black Panther, the title character. Following 'Captain America: Civil War', T'Challa returns to his home of Wakanda, a secret technologically advanced nation. Given his Father's demise in 'Civil War' he is to take his rightful place as King of Wakanda until unexpected adversaries surface which threaten not only his place on the throne but the fate of Wakanda itself. For the most part 'Black Panther' is fun, exciting and sometimes even funny and features excellent performances from a terrific ensemble cast. However, it is not without its problems which for me prevent it from being a top tier MCU entry. First of all it seems in an attempt to side step the very well known villain problem in the MCU, director Coogler has actually shot himself in the foot and created one the most irritating and drab villains in this universe namely Eric Kilmonger. Michael B Jordan's performance as Kilmonger doesn't help either which is over done and at times a harbinger of cringe. The fault of this character is also due in part to the screenplay which leaves him out of it for almost an hour after his introduction. Honestly after his first scene had passed I completely forgot about him and was almost lead to believe that Klau (Andy Serkis) was the main antagonist of the film. Despite his motivations being more understandable than most mustache twirling villains in the MCU, the execution of the character is rather disappointing and a big misfire.Now that the glaring problem is out of the way there are also some minor issues worthy of mention. The CGI looks unfinished in some places particularly in the big action set pieces toward the end. At one point Black Panther and Kilmonger look like video game creations when they fighting in mid air. This probably sounds like I am trashing this film but I actually do like it quite a bit overall, I just felt it necessary to point out the wildly obvious missteps that a lot of people seem to be missing or blissfully ignoring. For example, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's tech wizard sister, is a revelation not only as comic relief but as vital character to much of the film's plot. Lupita N'yongo also does good work here as T'Challa's love interest. Chadwick Boseman impresses again as T'challa, following on from his small but standout role in 'Civil War', proving a very charasmatic lead. Andy Serkis is also great here looking like he's having all the fun in the world and stealing every scene he's in reprising his character from 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. So all in all 'Black Panther' is a decent upper mid tier entry in the MCU with some issues that prevent it from being one of the best that this universe has to offer."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2019,10/10,"I just don't understand why y'all continue to review the same thing on every post are all the people here racist!? The black community barely has any past, not to mention modern super hero's, it's not a race thing but for real. No one said Ant-man, Thor The Dark World, justice league, Wonder Woman and Venom was overrated. It's actually underrated because of the amount of people calling it overrated. Black panther isn't your typical marvel film, it tells a symbolic story of power,pride, loyalty and honor. It's obvious we come from different lifestyles and won't be able to understand each other, cause your so used to having things your way and everything having to do about you that when you see something different you don't know how to act.. because it's out of your normal supremacy reach. Black panther has been a influential character in the Marvel comics since the 60s it was based on the comics. Blame Stan Lee A WHITE MAN for the story. All the racial bias this movie is receiving is why the movie is so successful you bunch of ignorant bashing fools, on top of the fact that it actually was a well made film it also circulates around an entire race of people, culture and continent exist. It envisions something that can and could be possible and it takes the viewers imagination to a different world that people enjoyed and it's a lot only cause it had an entire black cast as I read many ignorant people here saying. the fact that all of these negative people can't appreciate what Black Panther has meant to the world and are instead focused on their own ignorant biases scheme is sad. You can hate all you want but that doesn't change all the achievement it has won.
Long Live The KingWakanda Forever"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2018, hype building up globally as the world waited for its release. Its near perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes has done nothing but exacerbate this hype, and I can confirm that the hype is definitely justified. Black Panther probably won't start the conversations about race that some critics might have you thinking, but it's just such a tasteful, entertaining, unique movie that does so much more than your typical Marvel flick.The film is set about a week after the events of Civil War, where T'Challa's father was killed at a bombing at a UN Convention in Vienna. T'Challa is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father and the king of Wakanda, the setting of the entire film. It's this struggle that the movie focuses on at first.The movie unfolds rather neatly, especially for a Marvel film, with the majority of the film centring in Wakanda. (Seems like Marvel's doing a lot more location centralisation; GOTG2 is mainly on Ego's planet, Thor: Ragnarok has a lot on Sakaar...it's better this way). I think some of the key highlights of Black Panther have to be the characters. Chadwick Boseman shines as T'Challa; seriously, his silent bad-assery is stunning. Shuri, T'Challa's sister, is probably my favourite character in the film, she's just really funny and sweet. Nakia and Okoye are both very powerful female characters in the film, both taking their turns in guiding T'Challa in his times of need.It's definitely the villain that many have really loved about this movie. Personally, while I loved Killmonger, I think maybe it would've been cooler if we got to delve a little more into his backstory and really understand his motives. Also, Claw is...just there...but when he is, he's fine. Martin Freeman returns as Agent Ross from Civil War, and while I'll readily admit I didn't need to see him back, it's nice to see him take on a bigger role in this movie as we delve more into his character.I feel like Marvel movies are slowly becoming more and more grounded as Marvel mature, and that definitely shows in Black Panther. The film is easily their most mature film yet; Thor: Ragnarok is plain fun, Spiderman Homecoming is just another packed Spiderman film, but Black Panther feels very deep and important. It explores very important themes, that of race, of T'Challa's moral battles, the theme of leadership and monarchy...Marvel have proved time and again that a superhero movie can be a comedy, and now they've just proven they can also be something so much more meaningful.You see, Black Panther is a very neat film. You can lose yourself in the stunning action of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but Black Panther will keep you engaged in its meaningful story, embroiled in its chief themes. All the characters shine as they deliver the movie's message about the challenges of being a leader, and the consequences of every action, big and small. I don't want to give the plot away, but its themes are what set it apart from any other Marvel film.Now, I can't say it's a perfect movie. I did like Killmonger, but let's be honest; at the end of the day, he's just another Marvel villain. Basically that means he just feels like he's there...never much of a huge threat. (I mean we already KNOW that Black Panther survives already, we saw him in the Infinity War trailer!) It's basically the same feeling for Claw. There's also Killmonger's girlfriend who we never really get to see that much of, which is sorta a shame, I guess I can forgive that though.Also, I think the soundtrack of this movie was a real highlight. I don't like trap music at all but I think it actually blended with this movie reasonably well. The soundtrack also sounded very traditional-African, especially given that Wakanda is a fake-country. That's actually one of the things you have to remember about this movie; it's as though it's trying hard to respect Wakandan culture, even though this culture is completely fictional. But hey, that's fine, right?In the end, there's isn't all that much to fault about Black Panther. I think its themes are its real strong point. Okay, so while it's got powerful themes at the end of the day it's still a superhero movie, so don't expect to be blown out of your socks. But still, it's just got such great, well-rounded characters that you find yourself really believing in, and a very nice, neat story. If you watch any movie before summer ends (it's summer here in Australia), make sure it's Black Panther. Many critics have called it the best movie in the MCU; I might not go quite as far to make that claim, but it's definitely close. Go and watch it, and make the choice for yourselves."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is the latest film directed by Ryan Coogler. I will start out with the performances that were good which are Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis. Sterling K Brown has a very small role in the film, but you can feel his impressive performance in throughout the entire film. This film is a little bit different when it comes to amount of blood due to the different forms combat that is in the film. This film has references from Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace, 007 films, Kingsman films, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Winston Duke in my opinion is the breakout star in the film and I would encourage people to look at him for more work in the future. I can honestly say that I did realize that he had small role on Modern Family. The performance of Letitia Wright reminded me in the best way of Q from 007 franchise. Danai Gurira performance reminded me of Viola Davis ferocity meets the agility of her character from the Walking Dead. Michael B. Jordan is the performance that I am still on the fence about I would describe of having elements of Malcom X, Blown Away, the Dark Knight, D√©j√† Vu. I can see this film being nominated for the 91st Oscars for best score, cinematography and costume design. My only real complaint with the film was with one of the special effects in the scene seemed not to be finished. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 9 and ¬æ stars out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,,"The screenplay shows a hidden country in Africa where technology is quite more advanced what creates cities of beauty and peace. But, inhabitants argue if they need or not to spread this civilization to other parts of troubled and impoverished planet earth. The secret of so advanced science is a type of metal found in this land with special and unusual features. Of course, criminals and CIA want this metal. The Black Panther is also the king of this country. He has the duty to protect the reign and to regain a piece of metal stolen by a criminal that can also reveal the secrets of Nakanda. He is surrounded by a group of woman warriors that protect him and the country. But, inside the country, several tribes fight for governing it. The fight scenes are extremely violent but movements from capoeira and Brazilian jiu-jitsu bring novelty to the combats. All over the scenarios, a mixture of technology and mythology and symbols from African gods, the Orixas, bring such harmony that one could say technology is a type of magic and Nakanda could be said a land of techno-shamanism. Overall the film creates a sex apple that invites us to dream with a world of beauty and peace without any type of racism."
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2019,10/10,"Truly an outstanding movie that thrills you from start to finish...
The negative reviews here are shocking...it's a shame so many reviewers see this movie ""through a glass darkly"". But everybody is entitled to their own opinion.Don't take my word for it...try out this movie yourself, and judge it by your own standards.The King of Wakanda - the New King - is inspiring and willing to embrace new ideas. If only there were more world leaders like him!!Spectacular Panoramas - Hilarious (at times) action - Superb fighting sequences - Inspiring family ties in Royal Wakanda family - Original Tech Concepts in Wakanda -
Balance of Male / Female stars - An Adventure for the Entire Family: something in it for everyone - Incredible Car Chases - Unique storyline unlike any previous film.Black Panther is ONE of the Marvels of this World......why miss it??"
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2019,1/10,This typical CGI movie plot is just so over used. Be creative for once.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Both the first dream of 2018 and the first film of Black Panther
Captain America set off 1.5 years ago: Black panther entered the war scene of heroes, the movie waited a long time, and I always wondered, and as I hoped it was a film I filmed, I saw that the acting scenes were wonderful and they prepared a clich√©, of course only Americans could save the world. There was music based on the traditional music of old African countries that was good for the theme, and of course hiphop style music. Ultimately, Captain must take the place of his father who died in America, T'Challa, pass the ceremony and the king will be chosen and will try to protect this adventurous Wakanday; old girlfriend's brother, mother and Agent Rose are helping her. While trying to get Wakanday back, T'challa's cousin T'challa is trying to get her pound from Erik Killmonger.
The only goal of Erik Killmonger was not to capture Wakandai, but to seize the world with weapons made from Vibranium sources in Wakande and try to stop it."
BLACK PANTHER,2 September 2020,9/10,"Black Panther is amazing, it has outstanding performances, amazing soundtrack, great action sequences, great humor, beautiful costumes, marvelous villain, and amazing story!! A negative here is the CGI, at times it's good, but at times it's messy and looks bad. Overall, BP is one of Marvel's best films ever made. Rest in Power, Chadwick üëë"
BLACK PANTHER,6 December 2018,2/10,"Judging by the hype I knew the movie would be bad. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. I like eye candy brainless popcorn superhero movies as much as the next person. But this was just bad. Again another movie relies on overwhelming CGI (that wasn't even that good) to outshine a dozen excellent actors. No one was allowed to display their talents. None of the characters are interesting or memorable and just when some character building starts another ridiculous fight scene breaks out or the scene is cut for no apparent reason. It is the ""Battlefield Earth"" of superhero movies. A mediocre plot is destroyed by awful dialogue and delivery. For those who demand a 'black super hero' movie do yourself a favor and watch ""Blade"" (or my favorite ""Undercover Brother"") which came out years earlier with none of the hype. Avoid Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,8/10,"Loved the soundtrack, the acting was on point. Really glad to see African Americans at the forefront of a superhero film"
BLACK PANTHER,30 May 2020,7/10,"I like this movie and think Chadwick Boseman was born to play the black panther, but I do think it is a bit overrated by the critics and media. Overall a good popcorn flick but I must say that the CGI for the rhinos at the end of the movie is poor."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"Reading the wiki entry on the black panther party: the FBI considered the movement 'the greatest threat to internal security of the country' at the time. Curiously enough, the Marvel comic character also preceded the forming of the party in 1966, though nowhere can you read that it had any influence. Also strangely enough, the new movie encourages the same practises that the party did, namely community outreach and medical clinics. And just like the party, the movie makes it clear that politics is about power. Where the film differs from previous black superhero movies is that the hero here does not live with other Americans in a harmonious melting pot: they are their own kingdom, and vastly superior to the 'colonializers' (word used in the movie, FYI Imdb editors..). Well I guess in the end all superhero movies are empowering to their constituency (spiderman: the geeky teenagers; superman: the goody two shoes; the avengers: the groupies? Thor: the rednecks). That's the positive thing I can see here. The movie is also reasonably entertaining."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"It's quite funny to read so many derogatory reviews by Imdb users about this movie. Once seen it's obvious that they write it from a political agenda or from a very limited interest in entertainment movies or, worst, from a racist or sexist point of view.
I don't think that Black Panther is the best superheroe movie ever (The Dark Knight or The Avengers or Spiderman 2 are better from MHPOV) nor the most funny (Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool would be) nor the most entertaining (here the list could be longer including some of the previous titles I've mentioned) but I think that it could be considered the most serious take for a superheroe mainstream movie. 
The beginning of the movie with the not much subtle message of Wakanda First! and how this evolve for the main character along the story (whose end of evolution is certified in the first extra scene after the main credits) clearly tries to send a message to the trumpists (and probably a lot of them are reviewing very low the movie) Also it tries to send a message of reconciliation to those that want to revive the ala ""Malcom X"" ideology or revanchist actions (here one has to think about the riots caused by some judicial decissions when police officers killed some black people or due to the move away of Southern symbols) portrayed by Killmonger. Probably some machist and alpha males (maybe a lot of them lovers of the macho image that superheroes use to portray) could feel that a so equal depiction of women and men as Warriors (yes with capital!, leaded by Nakia and Okoye) or scientists (the perfectly seized and restrained funny Shuri) or whatever, threatens their comfort zone. It has a good story and as well structured as a perfectly narrated story has to; the hero has to suffer a change and it happens thanks to the lesson he learns from his antagonist. The perfect simbiosis of the two faces of human personality by the hero and his opposite.
Naturally this is a Marvel and Disney movie and these companies are not going to create a manifesto or a propaganda film hence they don't dig in those topics as an independent movie would do. Killmonger character lacks of a wider development and the talent of Michael B Jordan deserved it and the myth of Klaw in the comic books is roughly severed in behalf of the narrative but despite everything I think that being an entertaining production it offers much ideas than we are used to and as much as expected in terms of joy and fun."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"I really had high expectations going in, maybe too high, but at some point I thought the Black Panther was in the Fast and the Furious and then some typical heist movie. OK, I'm being harsh and I didn't hate it, just didn't like it, kinda blah. And all the talk about Marvels first black superhero, but as far as movies go lets not forget Blade. I have seen Blade a few times, and I think I like it better, a little bloody, but I liked Snipes in that role, he nailed it. You know what, maybe I'm just suddenly tired of these current Hollywood blockbusters."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"This is a solid superhero movie. It's entertaining all the way through, with action, humor, plot, character, and most of all great science fiction futuristic world-building using various African cultures which remained identifiable and individual in their dress, music, etc. while participating in a super-modern society. I loved the African music. If I had been watching this at home instead of in a theater I would have gotten up and danced. In think the animals were CGI but I liked them anyway. I would have liked to see more of them. I hope there will be a battle rhino sequence in Infinity War. I liked that the people of Wakanda are openly pagan, worshippers of Bast, the Egyptian cat goddess, and I would have liked to see more about that, too. I would have liked to see more of a lot of the world-building elements of Wakanda, in fact, and I hope there is more in Black Panther 2. And if that's not already in development, get on that, Hollywood. Next time, more cats, please. The heroI like that this superhero has a completely different reason for wearing a mask and superhero suit than the standard superhero. Black Panther is not trying to hide his identity. He is more identifiable as the King of Wakanda when he's in the suit than when he's not. He wears a mask because the Panther mask is his crown. It's part of his culture, rooted in African customs around ritual masks. There's even a part of the movie where African ritual masks in a museum are glossed with their ages and cultures of origin. It might be a little odd for an ultramodern society with really advanced science to still pick their leaders through ritual combat, but it definitely worked as a plot device and an excuse for action and for showing ritual and having great ritual dress and songs. This is not the only story where an advanced society still does that; it's one of the fundamental plot elements of the Pride of Chanur series too. That's about lions, though, which actually do have pride males that challenge for dominance of a pride. Panthers don't actually live in packs like that. Oh, well, that's a really minor quibble. I could say more about T'Challa but I don't think I could come up with anything else that would be original, that other reviewers haven't already said, so I'll just say I am looking forward to seeing him again soon in Infinity War where I expect he will be working with Capt. America (and according to the second after credit scene-- spoiler alert! With Bucky / Winter Soldier, too.) The villainI like that they gave us a ""villian"" so relatable that a lot of people think Killmonger is the hero. His view that Wakanda should help the less fortunate black people of the world is a view shared by Black Panther's love interest, and (spoiler alert!) Black Panther softens his stance in this area at the end of the movie. (There's another villain who is more villainous, Klaue the arms dealer, but he's a small-timer whose corpse Killmonger stands on, on his way to the top of the heap.) I also liked that Killmonger only remained true to his principles until he actually got power, and then basically turned into a colonizer, with his ""sun never sets"" line that echoes the famous line about the British Empire. This not only showed that Killmonger was in fact the bad guy in this story but also is true to human nature in that way that, as they say, power corrupts. On the Nature of Good and EvilOne expects a superhero movie to have its good guys all good and its bad guys all bad, and this one breaks that expectation in many ways. Not only is the main villain not really evil, but the same characteristic is present in some of the good guys and bad guys. For example, the first scene that shows Killmonger is supposed to be a bad guy is when he is willing to kill his lover to achieve his goal, which he of course believes is a noble goal. Later, the general of the Doras displays this exact same characteristic, willing to kill her lover for Wakanda in their civil war, and she is one of the good guys. This makes these characters very human, in that no one is all good or all evil. Bottom line: Good movie, see it."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I loved Black Panther! Black Panther is fantastic for the following reasons.
 1. Beautiful African Women in strong roles
 2. Great dramatic acting
 3. The comic relief was perfectly timed
 4. The hero and villain are wonderfully matched
 5. Very captivating and entertaining
 6. Great thought provoking dialogue
 7. Wonderful costumes
 8. Wonderful hair styles
 9. Good non-bloody action scenes"
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,9/10,"I am amazed at all the extremely low ratings here compared to, say, Iron Man 2, a truly disappointing Marvel film. This has action, a coherent plot, humor, wonderful worldbuilding, astounding special effects and addresses some real world issues in a way comic book movies rarely do. The actors are a delight, especially Letitia Wright and Andy Serkis. Chadwick Boseman is a hero with gravitas you love to cheer for and Michael B. Jordan is a tragic supervillain with motivations and goals that actually make sense. This is a great movie and an extraordinary superhero film."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"The hero of the tale is, of course, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the king of Wakanda and, as the Black Panther, protector of his people. Having drunk the nectar of a mystical flower, he has the strength of many men; in a suit woven of bullet-proof vibranium, he is virtually indestructible. (That's the Marvel part.) Indeed, Wakanda itself is built on the bounty of a meteorite bearing vibranium-the strongest metal on Earth-that struck Africa millennia ago. Technologically advanced beyond the dreams of any other nation, Wakanda cloaks itself from the world behind an illusory rainforest. As far as the rest of the world knows, it is a ""third-world country-textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.""As the new king-his father having been killed in Captain America: Civil War, the movie that first introduced Black Panther-T'Challa is supported, and occasionally hindered, by an assortment of family, colleagues, and rivals: his younger sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), a precocious tech genius who outshines even Tony Stark; his regal mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett); the kingdom's high priest, Zuri (Forest Whitaker); T'Challa's best friend and chief of the border guard, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya); the surly chief of a rebellious clan, M'Baku (Winston Duke); his chief general and head of the Dora Milaje, an all-female royal honor guard, Okoye (Danai Gurira); and T'Challa's former flame, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who is also a covert agent for the Dora Milaje.As with any superhero movie, there are a handful of smaller-scale fights leading to one large-scale melee that is completely bonkers (complete with armored, rambunctious African wildlife), but the best parts of the movie fall in the spaces between those fights. T'Challa's royal blood makes him the rightful heir to the throne, and with that great power comes a set of great challenges - or rather, one great challenge that dictates every other challenge he's about to face.But Black Panther isn't just T'Challa's story. It's also Killmonger's, He's a lost son whose father was killed by the king, and that king prevented him from achieving his birthright and destiny.
The plot and the story connects well. 
Kendrick Lamar's score is amazing. Andy Serkis is the show stealer. M'Baku is hilarious.
The humor is well fitted in the story which actually suits the process. No useless humor. Action sequences are kickass. 
Coming to the cons this movie it's that the climax plot was a bit predictable. But the pros do cover up this small con.
So For a superhero origin movie it's a good start.
A must watch. WAKANDA FOREVER."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,7/10,"Out of all the recent Marvel movies to be released, Black Panther is the one I was looking forward to the most. Black Panther is a Marvel character that I was very unfamiliar with (much like Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and pretty much all of the guardians of the galaxy characters, etc), so I was very keen to see its own solo movie and I will say that the film is entertaining and the action scenes are decent, though not as impressive as the fights involving Black Panther in the previous Captain America movie, Civil War. I won't go into too much detail, but basically the movie is about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) becoming the King of Wakanda (a secret society hidden within the mountains and forest) who is then challenged by Kilmonger (Michael B Jordan) a rebel who believes that he has been abandoned by his people and starts planning to take over Wakanda as its leader. The supporting cast are all good and I'm always happy to see Angela Bassett, in any movie.If there are weaknesses to the film, I would say that it's mainly to do with some of the characters, there really is not much development with them, especially with Kilmonger. Those who complain about the lack of an origin story, do not forget we did get some of that with the Civil War movie and Black Panther basically continues on from there. Overall, it's an entertaining movie certainly worth watching and for me, a better movie than either of the guardians of the galaxy movies (yeah as you can tell I can't stand those movies)."
BLACK PANTHER,30 July 2019,2/10,"This was plain and simple a very bad movie. The society was supposedly holding back on helping the rest of mankind, yet they choose their leaders through single combat. We see every day that technology alone does not save us. Good politics does a great deal of good. Bad politics does a great deal of harm. Technology is just an ingredient in that. Choosing leaders that way is so anachronistic as to be laughable and clearly is not part of a society that can help anyone, let alone themselves. The writers clearly have no knowledge of history or anthropology. Then, also, the actions of most of the male main characters being largely based on irrational and emotional responses does not lend itself to a stable society. If women in leadership acted on their emotions that way, they would be removed immediately in most every screenwriter's world. This movie was full of cliches, was not based on knowledge of actual history or politics; it was shallow and without substance."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,7/10,"Once again, Marvel have created a brilliant and epic standalone movie which should please audiences globally. Similar to Thor and Civil War there are elements of humour but also a serious and engaging plot. There are also brilliant action scenes thanks to great directing and casting.The movie also has a strong message which is that diversity and cultural acceptance is essential for economic and technological development.Not one to be missed. WAKANDA FOREVER."
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2019,2/10,"I have tried watching this movie at least 10 times, a few times in the theatwrs and then at home now that we own it. Every single time, I fall asleep in the same spots. I wake up every time somewhere(always the same)then fall back asleep. I still have not seen this full movie beginning to end. I have admitted defeat and don't really have any interest in trying again. I don't understand how people credit this as the best Marvel movie ever....in my opinion, this movie is highly overrated, definitely the worst Marvel movie(including The Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire, Fantastic Four kovies, and The Hulk movies), and just plain borning."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"PROS:
Most roles and main roles cast with black people.Lots of important roles cast with female actors.CONS:
bad CGI (like from 10-15 years ago)bad actinghorrible dialogues (bad jokes, corny philosophical platitudes, generic bla bla)mediocre plot with plenty of plot holescorny settings (cheesy sunsets or pink northern lights everywhere)very, very disappointing action scenes (there are only 2 anyways)over-eager placement of African decorative items and symbolsbad scene transitioningVERDICT:
This is a rather boring and slow B movie you can watch once with your friends and then forget forever. I recommend to have lots of snack-food and other things in reach to make this horrible movie more palatable. 1/10"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is the 18. movie in the MCU and I expected to see a great story after the events in Captain America: Civil War. I am a bit disappointed with the film now and I think that it is one of the worst in the MCU.Firstly, I didn't see the great badass Black Panther from the previous movie - he was powerful, confident and inspiring in Civil War. In this film he was totally different character and I had the feeling that Killmonger entirely deserved his moral victory. Erik was an interesting villain, one of the best in the MCU - Michael B. Jordan did a good job in this film. I would also like to praise Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya for their performance (I give this 7/10 mostly because of these two phenomenal actors). Overall, Black Panther is OK, but it is far behind Thor: Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy (1 and 2) and Iron Man (1) in the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,9 November 2018,1/10,This movie started off really well. There are two especially good fight scenes at the beginning with practical effects but then the last 30-40 minutes are an all out orgy of CG with absolutely no story whatsoever. Totally overrated.
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,5/10,"I enjoyed Black Panther overall and I would recommend this to a friend. I rated ""5 stars"" for being an average film in my opinion. Black Panther did everything I wanted out of a movie. I enjoyed the cast and the characters.In my opinion the film falls short in that there is no real plot. The main characters fight over the thrown, but by the end nothing has really progressed or changed in the characters relationships to each other since the beginning.I enjoyed several of the action and fight scenes and enjoyed the theatrics and the dress of the characters. The costume design was beautiful, which to me, made up for lack of substance in the plot-line.I enjoyed the female leads and thought the did an excellent job complementing the main character. I also enjoyed the sci fi side of the technologies."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2019,10/10,"Black Panther knows how to create good characters with at least some trait and personality. T' 'chala is a hero and a good man but that doesn't means he's perfect and without conflicts. Nakia, okoye and shuri have their own personality and conflicts or convictions. Killmonger is a good villain with personality and real motivations.
About the politics: this is part of the movie inside it own rules. Wakanda wasn't beeing free to the world and the whole thing is about that and killmonger wanted this because of they killing his father and don't helping the persons he saw suffering and did too. Wakanda has every resource to help the outside world and the discussion is if they will and how will.
Beyond that, black panther brings a cultural celebration and is everything part of the movie.
The only flaws are the action and the cgi in the end. But because those people complaining about the politics saying nonsense thing I'll give a 10/10. It was for be a 9/10."
BLACK PANTHER,27 June 2019,5/10,"The movie is a good movie but, they could have done better. 5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2020,5/10,"From the beginning to the end of the film, there is a big claim that Wakanda has IRON and its technology, but it is surprising that 90% of the citizens of its country are still relying on eating soil to solve their livelihood problems. This is like North Korea's big claim to be self-conscious It is as brazen as the People's Democratic Republic! Only people who live in Pyongyang can be considered masters, others are farts! Why don't you simply say that it is your royal family of the Black Panther that monopolizes the world's IRON ? Do your people have the right to share iron's technology? No! So what is the difference between you and Kim Jong Un? I am invincible? So your life or death has nothing to do with you? Such a country is surprised that the people have not been overthrown! It can be seen that the African people still lack communist education! It is difficult to imagine that a country with high technology not only refuses to improve the lives of its citizens but also shamelessly finally gives technology to Western countries unconditionally. Sure enough, it is the African version of the Qing empire."
BLACK PANTHER,31 December 2019,4/10,"Black Panther fails to execute an interesting plot idea. While the movie looks breathtaking, it is nothing short of a mashed up pile of disgraceful failed attempts at a superhero movie."
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2021,7/10,Black panther is one of my favorite movies time and by far the best superhero movie I have ever watched. The movie is unique to the MCU with a perfect storyline and it flows excellently.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"Well, I have to say, I love the MCU and a big fan of all the new movies, but when i heard they were going to make Black Panther, I thought to myself, maybe its a step too far.I just can't get enthused to watch it... I usually do not watch any trailers for movies i know i will watch, but having seen about 20 seconds, and with all the hype and constant adverts, i decided i'll give it a gp... Well, OH YES !Never have i been so wrong about a movie. Maybe because i was not expecting much (but I don't think so) the movie was very impressive. I will not go into any level of detail here, so as to avoid spoiling any of your pleasure, but in a time when few films are worth the ticket price, this is definitely worth it.Its not perfect, hence my rating, as some bits feel tagged on, especially near the end, and the running time is a bit too long for my liking, but if you are in the mood for an Iron Man 3 type movie with a strong storyline, plenty of action and a good social aspect, this is a must.Enjoy !"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,7/10,"Great acting, great story and amazing special effects. 
I went into the cinema with an open mind due to all of the hype surrounding Black Panther. There has been many mixed views with this movie. I can say mine was a positive one. 
The African culture brought to screen was amazing. The beautiful colours, design work and pure sophistication of this movie gets my vote. Going to see again today."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2018,7/10,"Ryan coogler has done a brilliant job. Fantastic visuals for all the sets and in depth colours. Brilliant action scenes and special effects. The story didn't wow me to greatly , give me Thor Ragnorok anyday. Too much publicity on this movie unexpectedly raised my expectations and unfortunately I was a little disappointed with what I got handed. 
My personal rating is doused by the whopping 97% on rotten tomatoes. Maybe I missed something?
Good movie none the less."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,8/10,"Its not a Typical Marvel Movie with Typical format of Fight ,comedy ,Ending Big fight .This Movie also don't have typical Marvel /Comic Villain of Destroying Earth cz they are villain .This Movie is way too grounded ,dealing with real life issues & that gave all the characters more depth than Any other Marvel movies .Movie fight with the Idea how Hero can be seen as Anti Hero & the Villain can be the Hero kinda like the Dark night .Movie also explore how being king isn't all about glamour & luxury ,its a hard job which Most other Super Hero didn't have to face .Movie has some brutal scene(death scene) (kid friendly way) ,it don't shy away from those as these scene actually make this movie look more like a political thriller & bigger/deeper than just a comic movie Best part of Black Panther is the strength of its side characters which most of the time other comic movie ignores .Fights of other fighters actually make the fight sequence more enjoyable & sometime their well choreographed fight scene actually surpass Black Panther's mask fighting .Yes movie has little bit comedy in it but its never felt like its just to fill the quota of comedy, they are few & maybe thats why really enjoyable After watching Most Comic movies i didn't feel anything when i left the theater ,it happened after watching ultron ,civil war .Its like memory of those movies wasn't deep/importannt enough to carry with me but Black Panther Stayed in my mind .There are some dark part of life this movie explored which make you think about your own opinion about reality even after you left the theater ."
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2018,10/10,"The fictional country of Wakanda is beautiful, the sunsets, landscapes and waterfalls are breathtaking. One of the scenes that stuck with me is the sunset scene with T'Challa and N'Jadaka near the end its so beautiful and powerful. Unlike all the other MCU movies this one feels more like an adventure movie than just a plain old superhero film like I said the lighting, colour, score and costumes are just amazing. The usual thing to do in comic book movies is to just totally ignore the character development of the villain and just concentrate on the hero, well Black Panther doesn't go that route, opting to concentrate on the hero and the villain equally. Achieving something truly rare in Hollywood movies a perfectly complete character arc for a villain. I saw this movie 3 times at the theater and about 20 times now on BluRay. I get why some MCU fans wouldn't like it because it needs a little bit of investing but for me as a big fan of movies in general, this is a masterpiece."
BLACK PANTHER,3 September 2020,4/10,Have to say its the most overrated movie i have ever seen. Acting at its worst
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,2/10,"After watching Black Panther and reading reveiws of how great it is, I have to disagree with those reviews. A fake country that could help people with spinal injuries or even loss of a limb and they refuse. They won't supply aid to any other African country as the rest of the world does. They won't share there resources/tech but are happy to be seen as a third world country.
The action sequences were quite good but no different than any other action movie from Marvel.
I agree with quite a few of the other review that point out the plot was very far fetched and I still didn't see what all the hype about this fictious country was all about. The villian of the movie was like any other villian pissed off with the world and wants to bring the whole world into chaos. Wakanda is full of LIARS and FAKES."
BLACK PANTHER,15 June 2021,1/10,"The most drawn out boring Marvel film yet.Enjoyed the character in other movies, ended up rooting for the bad guy."
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2019,6/10,"Black Panther is the story of a king with super powers whose throne gets questioned by someone who sees themselves as the rightful heir to the throne. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa in this film who is the King of wakanda, an African Country that is hidden by technology. Michael B. Jordan plays a kid a kid from California, Erik Killmonger, who believes that he has been cheated from the throne and decides that he will challenge T'Challa for it. These characters both want to prove they are not possers of the power and are not pushovers.
This movie was fairly entertaining, it had very good visual effects and fun action scenes. The movie just didn't hit that big not for me that it seemed to by everyone else. I had fun watching the film but I didn't think that it was great in anysense if the matter. The story seemed like a very played out of a man who thinks he should be king so he fights the king for it, just with superpowers. It was fun but again just not the best superhero film of the year or the past couple of years.
This movie came out early last year following the huge buzz that was Captain America: Civil War, where the Black Panther was introduced. The movie didn't need to be another origin story and it wasn't so I give props to the filmmakers for that part of it. I just do not see how this movie got nominated for an oscar, all of the performances were fine, the dialogue was fine and the story was fine.
All aspects of this film were done great, I believe with the script that the movie had it did the best it could on every level. The editing and sound were put together well to create seamless scenes and fights. All of the dialogue seemed real, for the most part. Not that the lines weren't written well, but the film takes place in an African Country and have been in that country forever, advancing far past the world, and staying hidden, but they all speak english. This is something that bothers me in a lot of movies, it might be very convenient but why don't they speak some African language, they have accents. Even the tribe that lives up into the mountains who seem to be a little primitive, when looking at how far they have advanced looking at how the other tribes have, they speak english as well throughout the film. Other than that though technically this film is very well done.
Going through and watching this film There was a scene that I really enjoyed, the scene in which Erik challenges T'Challa for his throne. The scene takes place in the throne room, Erik is taken into the the room where he is being prosecuted. Only to find out that his has rights to be the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. The camera use in this scene is very minimal, just cuts to who is talking going back and forth. It is a very common technique used to just show what everyone's thinking and feeling and that was probably the best way to go with this scene as what was happening was shocking a lot of people so all of their emotions. There is nothing notable about the lighting, the scene is in a room with a big window during the day so you can see everyone's face well. What I like about this scene is something that has been done a million times over is the build up with music until you find out what Erik was hiddining from them when he revealed his blood right and that he wanted to be the king. Just a simple build up in music before that delivery was done well. The pacing in this scene was fun to watch everything seemed fine and going a nice pace, then once they start to exchange information back and forth the camera cuts begin to speed up. From this scene which has no action you can see that on a technical aspect there are zero problems with this film. Another problem this film didn't have was acting, there was an all star cast. Everyone does really well to make their character believable and give true emotions for what is happening and what might happen for them in the future.
I have only seen this film three times, in the theaters, once when I caught it on tv and when I just rewatched it this week to give a review, I do not have that big of a problem with the film, I am not a big fan of it though, as I have said I think that there are better superhero films, even better redemption films, which is a big element of this movie.
With all of these different grips with the movie i do not want to give the impression that I hate this movie, just a tad bit overrated. I enjoyed it for the most part and if you like the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than you would probably enjoy this film as well. If i was tot give this a film a rating from one to ten I would say 6/10. It was good on a technical scale but it was an overused story."
BLACK PANTHER,19 June 2019,6/10,"Black Panther is a very standard super hero flick from Marvel.In terms of this movie itself, it's fairly bland. Nothing offensive or inventive. The production value is great, albeit some very poor CGI in the final battle scene. The protagonist once again suffers from what I call ""Marvel Syndrome"", where the character is rigid and doesn't have a personality. He is just there on the screen, reacting to things happening to him. He has no real agency or persona.On the other hand, the cultural significance of this film with nearly all black cast and black talents behind the camera is immeasurable to many modern day movie viewers. Not to take credits from the cast and crew of this film, I would not consider this as a cultural milestone for black community or people of color in general. For me personally, it has always been Will Smith in the first ""Men In Black"" movie, which came out twenty years earlier in 1997."
BLACK PANTHER,30 November 2018,2/10,"I am a HUGE MCU fan, and this is by far the worst movie in the MCU and the worst movie I have seen at a cinema. It's a huge shame because this movie was labelled as ""historic"" but it was just very boring with poor action scenes and bad chemistry between most of the actors. The villain in this movie I struggled to see as a villain, without spoilers he had been through a lot of bad things which made him want revenge, doesn't this sound Moreno like a good guy than a bad guy?On a whole, terrible film and if you're watching all the MCU films then just skip by this one."
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,2/10,"This movie is bad. The only reason it could have this high rating is political correctness. Hollywood decided to make a movie where all actors are Afro-Americans and then to applaud it endlessly to compensate for lack of the actors in all other movies.First of all, I do not understand why they all talk like that. Imagine a movie where all actors are Chinese and they all speak English with thick accent. All of them. That thick accent always speaks about the origin. You want to say that a character is Chinese or Afro-American or Mexican or Irish or whatever. But if they all speak like that, that does not have any sense. They are all from where?The script has free elements added from African culture, magic and similar, but there is a big problem there. If they are so advanced why would they keep any of that? It looks more like an enforced ""culture"", i.e. how white people see it all with no real African cultural ground.I could not watch it actually without being bored to death. It is like force-feeding experience into a Hollywood apology over the treatment of Afro-American culture. Speaking of that, did you count how many of them perished in Infinity War? Half? I would not say it was half. I believe that Thanos reverted it all to how it really is in Hollywood.The apology is a fleeting attempt that does not serve its purpose and makes quite a bad movie."
BLACK PANTHER,13 November 2019,1/10,Extremely forgettable. Weak plot and characters. Somewhat boring and no really powerful or intelligent messaging. Waste of time.
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,7/10,"After weeks of reviews both praising and belittling BP, I figured I'd watch it myself and make my own judgment. I have to say that I am completely in the middle about the movie.For a Marvel movie, I was a bit let down - there were far too many incongruities to make me love it, but some of the acting was outstanding, specifically Michael B. Jackson and Martin Freeman (Andy Serkis was damn convincing as well.) The rest of the actors were pretty flat and predictable. They did a GREAT job with the CGI, though.One of my biggest complaints with BP was the idea that an independent nation that had its own language spoke both in english and wakandan and slipped back and forth in their own country. If the characters are going to speak english, speak english. If they're going to speak wakandan complete with subtitles, make us read. Really annoyed the hell out of me.Its worth a watch, and I'm glad I did - once. Won't be watching again unless there's nothing on but soccer."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,6/10,"Yes it is an entertaining movie... but one viewing is enough (way too long...) and don't understand what's all the hype about it and the crazy cash it grossed!
Sign of the times and the fight against the Orange Man and rampant racism. But so much more better movies out there..."
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2021,10/10,"I'm sure people who can't appreciate superhero movies are rolling their eyes right now but guess what!? This movie is so well excecuted, so full of meaning and so full of talented actors that it deserves all the love and hype!The visuals, the action, the costumes, the story, the music, the message and the perfomanes make Black Panther an amazing movie overall.Don't miss it, you'll have a great time."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,8/10,"I gave this film an 8 because it is really good from start to finish. Most people just rate without leaving an review of the movie. So disregard all the 1 stars. Most of these people are racist in their feelings about an all black cast. Not giving away any spoilers, but Panther is a thrill ride from start to finish. If you love the Marvel series of movies, you will enjoy Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman gave a convincing performance at Panther, the King of Wakanda people. Danai Gurira, from the walking dead fame, is excellent as always. There is something empowering watching Okoye kick butt with her arrows and swords, guns are for punks. Overall, I would recommend this film. Again, don't pay attention to the 1 star rating. At the least Panther deserved 5 stars. Any 1 star rating is sour grapes from the usual racist in America that caused the message board on IMDB to close down. Black Panther is a must see for all the Marvel fan lovers."
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2020,2/10,"And the Oscar for the biggest Marvel failure goes to.....Black Panther.
I watched it to the end because it was so bad.
How could that get 3 Oscars? How can rotten tomatoes write so positively about this lousy waste of time ? How can that be part of Marvel ? So boring and foreseeable story mixed with non existing acting and wrapped into kitsch music and purple sky's. One day I will be held responsible for my time on earth and what I did with it. Somebody angry will point a finger at me and say : you watched this to the end ?No really guys, something went all wrong here."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,8/10,"Too violent for kids, but really enjoyed the movie. Only weakness was some weak acting and times when dialogue was hackneyed. But what Marvel movie doesn't have that. I wanted to hate the movie because of all the BS hype and political correctness baloney, but after sitting through the first ten minute with a scowl and crossed arms, I ended up really enjoying it. It is a fun and exciting superhero adventure."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2018,8/10,"Loved the story, graphics were great, fine acting... For the Marvel series, it doesn't get much better than this..."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,8/10,"I'm a bit puzzled at the negative reviews floating to the top, but I'm guessing the superhero movie fatigue and racist tendencies of reviewers has something to do with it. Black Panther is everything you could want from a Superhero origin story, and sometimes more. Black Panther forgoes the typical superhero origin format, and we begin with T'Challa primed and ready for the throne, which is refreshing because we don't have to see scene after scene of a superhero beginning to understand their powers and slowly coming into themselves, we get to cut to the best parts of his story, and essentially get into the action rather quickly. Although some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped, namely W'Kabi who is unbelievable as T'Challa's lifelong friend and lover of Okoye, because we see so little of him, most of the characters are multidimensional and more fully realized than I've come to expect in MCU films. The first act of the movie sets up Andy Serkis as the main villain, but he's quickly dispatched of midway through the movie to make way for the more interesting Kilmonger. Kilmonger does have a cliche childhood trauma backstory, but is still leagues above the average action movie villain, which often ends up being a CGI monster or last minute obstacle for the protagonist to kill. The morality is surprisingly nuanced, and I found myself siding with Kilmonger for parts of the movie, and actually questioning the heroes motivations and methods, which makes for much more interesting storytelling. The female characters actually get a chance to shine, and are just as compote to and important to the story as T'Challa. Okoye was the main standout, the leader of a group of generals who serve the throne of Wakanda, Okoye gets to have amazing action sequences and I would've almost liked to have her be the one to defeat Kilmonger as opposed to T'Challa, but I understand why from a storytelling perspective they went with a more conventional ending. Nakia, is the love interest of T'Challa and actually sides with Kilmonger in some ways, and actually changes T'Challa's opinion by the end of the movie. Unlike most heterosexual romances in these kinds of films, I didn't find the relationship forced or gratuitous, and I liked that it was more of a small part of the story, and their friendship was the focus for the most part, as well as their ideological differences.Shuri is another very well developed character, and is the Black Panther's younger sister who masterminded much of Wakanda's technology and the Black Panther suit itself. Shuri was not only extremely smart, but a great comic relief at times, although I felt her interactions with Martin Freeman's character got tired eventually, because it seemed like he was tacked on purely for exposition purposes and to give white people someone to relate to. All in all I I thought Black Panther had great, if not overtly CGI action, and the costume and general set design was amazing, and probably the standout aspect for me. The aesthetic perfectly married futuristic sci-fi with tribal design, as well as an Art Deco sensibility reflected in the poster. Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies in recent years, another hit for Marvel with a touching message about not cutting yourself off from the rest of the world and sharing resources to boot."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"Ugh i don't want to waste my time anymore , so let me say in few words, this is worst marvel movie i ever seen, atlast ANTMAN is way better than this , Another rich boy from the africa making hi-tech suits poor taste of IRONMAN, welp most of the actions was so bad even when they fight in the South korean road. So overrated movie. Im paused this movie at 56:01 this is totally garbage, and i wonder why the heck this movie get 7.7 from IMDB? Just don't waste your time. Im still yawning while i writing this"
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2018,7/10,"Solid good movie, and about a 7 out of ten. Nothing was groundbreaking about the plot or characters. I thought it was in the top five of Marvel's best movies, but certainly not as good as Thor: Ragnarok."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"First of all, let's start off by saying that I loved Black Panther. It was everything I wanted it to be and more.The Pros are endless. The acting alone is worth notifying. Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker and Michael B. Jordan all do fantastic.But it all really does come down to the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther himself, doesn't it? I'l tell you what, he is stellar. His performance as T'challa is so subtle and so on point with the comics, which I'm a huge fan of.Next up, the action scenes/directing. I could not be happier for Ryan Coogler right now, with this, Creed, and Fruitvale Station. I do have to say I was a bit dissapointed with the final fight, but that's mostly on the lighting team.The story is great, the cast is great, the overall movie as a whole is great. I have but one flaw with it and this flaw could be considered a nitpick by many.My flaw is that it does become the stereotypical marvel movie once in a while. There are certain character actions that wouldn't make sense in the actual tone that the movie presents us with, times where a character makes an unnecessary pun, and even an SUV chase towards the middle of the film.I overall loved Black Panther. It has a very essential meaning to it that I personally think everyone will grasp hold of and also fun sequences that everyone will enjoy.Black Panther gets an A or on an Imdb scale, a 9"
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2019,10/10,Black Panther is an amazing film. Period. I don't know why there are so many low reviews on this site it is ridiculous. This movie has cultural significance and a great message. It celebrates African culture and explores the difficult histories of slavery and colonialism - deeper issues than you would find it many other Marvel films although that being said I love Marvel and appreciate escapism and adventure. Please do not come on this site to write reviews if you are being racially prejudiced - there's no need for this kind of behaviour in 2019. Wakanda Forever!!!
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,1/10,"The most overrated film in history !
Save your money Save your time"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,2/10,"This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,3/10,The main reason's i saw this film is because i like the director and this was the last movie before infinity war so when i saw it this movie felt longer than infinity war it felt like i was there for a whole day the jokes are terrible the script is weak the acting is fine but 70 percent of the cgi was terrible it like they moved the normal marvel cgi team to infinity war and put only four people to do cgi for this and this movie is irritatingly overrated and i hear a lot of morons say if you don't like it your racist just no it's a weak scripted film and also the director ryan coogler did not know how to do a film of this type just because he did good indi film's does not mean he can do a film of this size he had to lose the 60 millimeter he could not do things he wanted to do in the end this film is just disappointing.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,9/10,"I was very excited for this movie for a while. I work at a movie theater, and I never got sick of seeing trailers for it. And fortunately, the movie delivered awesomely. There were a few things I didn't care for, but no movie's perfect.
Starting with the cons. T'Challa's mom didn't really do anything? She should've had some more things to do in the story. Some of the exposition and beginning could've been shortened. I liked that they took their time, but it's almost like they did it too much in the beginning and too little at the end so they could've balanced it out. The ""what are those?!"" comment was just... unnecessary. Come on Marvel. And I wish Michael B. Jordan had more screen time because he was fantastic, the best Marvel villain overall in my opinion, and did an amazing performance. Some of the technology seemed a little far-fetched, and since they didn't expand on how most of it really worked, it makes the characters seem pretty invulnerable at times. Though they counteract it well at some points, like taking away Black Panther's superhuman qualities when he fights for the throne. 
The majority of the movie was the pros. All the performances were great, I don't think there was one character that was acted poorly. Micheal B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman are both stars that deserve more positive attention, because they're fantastic in everything I've seen them in. This is no exception. Adding onto this, pretty much everyone also wen through character development to some degree, which is unfortunately a rarity in most blockbusters. However, Ryan Coogler is definitely a director that cares about that sort of thing. I certainly want to start a petition for Marvel to hire more directors with visions of their own. Taika Watiti and now Ryan Coogler, very good calls. All the characters were just so well-written, it made me so happy. Especially all the strong and well-written female characters. See Hollywood? It's not hard to do it. It felt so natural and made so much sense, they were all treated with so much respect and I'm over the moon. We need more strong and well-written female role-models in movies, especially those of color. And not all of the, were just ""hot girl who kicks ass and that's it"" either! Yay! I actually found myself wanting more close quarters action, since the stunts and fight choreography were both amazing. The way the love story with T'Challa and Nakia was approached and written was refreshing. It wasn't like literally almost every other Marvel movie where the characters meet in the movie and fall in love within the events of the movie. T'Challa and Nakia had a history, a believable one, and we were rooting for them to get back together. And when they did, it wasn't one of them making a sacrifice for the other. T'Challa offered Nakia a way to fulfill what she wanted while still being close by. One thing I was worried about was they wouldn't blend the traditional African culture with futuristic imagery that well, and that it'd be clunky and unnatural. But this was something that was actually done pretty well, and in a believable way. Overall, fantastic movie."
BLACK PANTHER,2 January 2019,1/10,Lol what is this hype? This is movie is disaster.People calling Superman Shrek face is worst CGI but did you see the Black Panther Car Chase CGI scene? I laughed so much.Script is very boring and Villain is so simple.And why everyone is talking like robot?Seriously worst Marvel Movie Ever and not deserve a reward.
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2018,6/10,"I didn't wanted to watch this movie at all, like never but I did and I liked it.I really liked it, with Michonne (wink to TWD) and all her fighting friends, etc.
The acting was good but they really wasted no time in explaining the life of Erik when he was young we are missing stuff in here. 
And the ending tho ...
Really 
What an ending 
... 
they sucked at it !
Worst ending ever seen.It's like saying ¬´ and Harry Potter woke up hearing the foot steps of his cousin who was jumping on the stairs ¬ª"
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2019,4/10,"One of the most controversial opinions I have is my hatred for Black Panther, and how I think it may be the most overrated movie of the year along with Ready Player One. Before you start commenting ''Oh you are racist'' just hear me out.Obviously there are good bits about Black Panther, not many but, even Ready Player One has good parts to it, so of course Black Panther will as well.To be fair to Black Panther, the costume design in the movie was fantastic, mostly due to the rathertalented Ruth Carter. Black Panther won the Oscar for costume design, where Ruth Carter became the first black designer to win the award. I would argue that The Favourite and Sandy Powell would have deserved it more, yet I wasn't too bothered with this win of theirs. The costumes used in Black Panther are fantastic and apparently very costly as well. These costumes include futuristic designs and African tribal designs, Ruth Carter does a tremendous job on the costume design.Black Panther had a very impressive production design, a rare sight for Marvel films, who have a reputation of having a poor production design. Again, Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar in this category, and for once, I would agree that they should've won in this category. The production design is so impressive in Black Panther. Hannah Bleacher, the production designer for Black Panther essentially created a whole society, in Wakanda. She created a sub-Saharan country, and used essential real-life elements and incorporated in this fantasy world. She made an futuristic city in a country that is clearly located in Africa. Hannah Bleacher used the costumes designed by Ruth Carter as inspiration for the production design. Bleacher clearly worked extremely hard in order to create this world, in fact, she traveled around Africa in order to get ideas on what Wakanda should be like, and other settings. Despite my hatred for the movie, I put my hat off to Bleacher as she does a great job with the production design.Music is ok, nothing much to say, can't judge music. It fits well with the movie, and I thought the music was appropriate.Now onto to the political commentary. Most of the reviews to this movie were politically motivated, due to the political commentary in the movie. But the political commentary in the movie is basically that Michael B Jordan who plays Killmonger in Black Panther wants to kill all the white people, and Chadwick Boseman who plays T'Challa wants to stop him. This movie attempts to make a commentary about how black people are treated in the United States, but it's so bad. Zootopia has better political commentary in it. All these reviews are so deluded, and think the movie is a great movie because of its message it sends. The movie's target audience is so mainstream, it targets everyone.The director of this movie, Ryan Coogler, is a fantastic director, and has directed great movies, such as Creed and Fruitvale station, but he has no experience when it comes to making a Marvel movie. He is an extremely talented director, and his talent is put to waste in this movie, he is unable to express his full creativity, and clearly wanted to steer the movie in another direction, but was unable to due to Marvel wanting to sell this movie to a mainstream audience. He has a 200 million budget to work with, yet can't express his true directing talents. He uses the basic marvel structure to a film, making the directing poor and unoriginal. The storyline was basic and lackluster. The action scenes in Black Panther are badly shot, and extremely lazy. Ryan Coogler had no past experience with filming action prior to become the director of Black Panther. Let this experience be a lesson to him, he is much better off not filming big blockbuster movies that's sole purpose is to gain a large financial reception.The main character who is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa or Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman is solid in his performance as Black Panther, but the character is so uninteresting. He is just boring. He seems to be good at being a king and a warrior, and seems to be unbeatable, making the movie very predictable. He's the son of a king, and a warrior for Wakanda. He is a very uninteresting, yet I think Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, just doesn't have a script to work with.The villain is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. Michael B Jordan isn't a very good villain, despite the villain being one of the best parts of the movie according to the critics. He is a very generic character and doesn't have a good motivation, just wanting to take over Wakanda and use his power for the better. This is a regurgitated motivation, and is used in so many movies. Michael B Jordan is really poor in this movie, despite him being such a great actor. Again he can't work well with the script. He was a forgettable villain, and was a completely overrated character. Compare Killmonger to The Joker from The Dark Knight. The Joker is almost better in every single way. He has a better motivation, Heath Ledger portrays him perfectly, and is so unforgettable. Exactly the opposite of Killmonger. There is also no character development in Killmonger. He has a two minute backstory in the middle of the movie, which doesn't explain much.Forest Whittaker, who is a fantastic actor, and played one of my favourite roles of all time, in The Last King of Scotland as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, does a poor job in Black Panther, he plays the exact same character he did in Rogue One.Just look at this video and you'll know what I mean;The visual effects in Black Panther is so inconsistent. Sometimes the visual effects are amazing, but sometimes it's awful. As you can see in the video just shown, Black Panther had some horrible CGI.Not much to comment on the cinematography of the film, it's so basic, and uncreative, but what can I expect from some a bland looking movie. The color palette of the movie is basic, and the CGI, as I said before is inconsistent. Ryan Coogler doesn't know how to direct film scenesLarge parts of this action sequence is badly shot, and again throughout the action sequence you can see the inconsistency in CGI.The dialogue is one of the worst bits about the whole movie. It's so weak, and bland. The dialogue is so predictable and bland. Every character speaks their mind, it seems like they don't think before they say anything. It is a superhero movie, so I wouldn't expect an amazing script, but dialogue this bad?The movie is so cringeworthy at some parts, and the humor is so bad. At one point they make a ''what are those joke''and it made me want to kill myselfOverall, Black Panther is a bad movie. It's extremely overrated and didn't deserve those oscars it was nominated for. The movie failed on so many levels. The plot is predictable, unoriginal and doesn't start until halfway through the movie. A movie doesn't need a good plot, as seen with the lobster, which has one of the craziest plots I have ever heard. The plot of the lobster is a man needs to find a wife in 40 days or else he'll become an animal, the plot is stupid, unique but bad, yet it is executed so well.Black Panther has bad dialogue, basic cinematography, okay music, no humour, inconsistent visual effects, bad acting, poor characters and a bad plot. The movie is a really overrated movie, and has been completely overrated by critics, who think the movie as much deeper than it actually is. If this movie was a superhero with majority of the cast being white, it would be compared to the third reich.I give this movie a rating.... 4/10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2021,10/10,"""Black Panther"" is the latest entry in the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe juggernaut. In the isolated, technologically-advanced African country of Wakanda, T'Challa is preparing to follow in his late father's footsteps as king. When the precious metal called vibranium, Wakanda's life-force, is stolen by a shady man who goes by the name Killmonger, working in conjunction with smuggler Ulysses Klaue, T'Challa jumps into action as the Black Panther, aided by his sister Shuri, ex-lover/spy Nakia, and Okoye of the all-female Dora Milaje. With the help of American agent Everett Ross, the Black Panther and his team set out to fight Killmonger and prove their worth in leading the Wakandan kingdom.Director Ryan Coogler brings to the forefront a standalone story more mature than any other in the Marvel canon. The screenplay, co-written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, touches on such themes as responsibility, betrayal, tribalism, and ultimately, manhood, with self-discovery as the most significant in T'Challa's quest to become king of Wakanda. This being the first Marvel movie to feature a predominantly African-American cast, the filmmakers maintain a clear focus on and respect for African identity, right down to the use of the Igbo and Xhosa languages. Wakanda itself is established as a vibrant blend of the modern and the traditional, thanks in part to its use of vibranium, with the urban areas resembling a bustling town square while the more mountainous sections are where the ancient tribes reside. Great emphasis is also placed on the all-female Dora Milaje soldiers as a major component to the film's success, with T'Challa's sister Shuri providing the necessary tools, and Nakia and Okoye of Wakanda's Dora Milaje putting their combative skills to good use. This is also exemplified in Ruth Carter's costumes, with the city civilians wearing chic clothes, whereas the tribe members are all draped in traditional fabrics and the soldiers wear armor, all of which are brimming with color. The ritual duels in Wakanda are choreographed to resemble a cross between wrestling and gladiatorial fights.Chadwick Boseman makes for an ideal heroic lead as T'Challa/Black Panther, while Michael B. Jordan, the primary player in Coogler's filmography, provides a blend of charisma, intensity, and sympathy in his antagonistic role of Killmonger. It is Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Guirra, however, who also provide the film's backbone, as the lead female players, while also exemplifying three-dimensional sensitivity and depth. Martin Freeman provides light touches of humor as Everett, while Andy Serkis sinks his teeth into the cold, calculated, and aptly-named Klaue. This cast is further strengthened by supporting players Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker. The musical accompaniment includes Ludwig Goransson's score blending orchestral prowess with African tribal chants and hip-hop beats, along with original songs provided by acclaimed artist Kendrick Lamar.""Black Panther"" proves to be a Marvel movie of significant impact while also being a unique standalone entry in their hugely successful cinematic universe. Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2021,10/10,This is my first MCU film which i had rated 10/10. This movie was amazing superb i am just having no words this movie is mind blowing and must watch.
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2020,1/10,"Black Panther had potential, but the whole effort was mediocre at best."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,3/10,Acting was pretty bad. Cardboard like. Ho hum identification with the characters. The fight scenes had choreography written all over them. The story was just plain bad. It went from pretty cool the first 15 minutes to cartoon like the rest of the move until the last minute or two. The score was non-descript except for the last one. The CGI was too obviously CGI. Check out the rhinos and you'll know what I mean.Overall a pretty poor movie that is WAY overrated. How this dog got 7+ here is a real mystery considering the overwhelming sentiment is sub 5 reviews.
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2019,2/10,"I couldn't be more excited to watch what they promised us to be ""the greatest Marvel movie ever"". Well well well... On behave of a firework, this movie is a real damp squib. The film frustrates as much as it motivared. A loss like this one wasn't easy at all to achieve. They did it. Technology and special effects can't save a single thing here. Soundtrack is with the image of this definitive and expensive mess."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,,"Black Panther ***Black Panther hits the big screen as another of the Marvel Universe characters get the big blockbuster treatment.There's a Shakespearean power struggle for the crown of the Black Panther and the future of the secret technological advanced empire Wakanda.There's a nice sense of maturity to the film in it's theme establishing the conflicts between family, friends, foes and outside forces as betrayal is rife.The good news is the film is a big solid hit. It provides all the thrills, excitement and most importantly the quality that marvels seems to assure its films get.Stand out performances really come from the villains in this film with a energetic Andy Serkis keeping it fun whilst Michael Jordan capitalizes on a generous character ark to fledge out a villain on multiple levels of emotion.In the scheme of things how does it land in the Marvel Universe well it's less funnier than Thor 3, less demanding than Civil War, better than Age of Ultron and better plotted than Guardians 2.Yes it's becoming a complicated old universe but all in all Black Panther holds it's own establishing another strong Marvel Character."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,7/10,"Ignore one and two star ratings, they're not honest reviews and in this world of ""alternative facts"" I'd expect nothing less, which is a shameThis wasn't a blockbuster and after Thor Ragnarok I was expecting too much. It's everything a superhero movie should be though, with cheesy dialogue and stereotyped characters, that's why I go to the movies to have a laugh and put my brain on hold for a few hours. Thanks Marvel I'm off to see Avengers now that I've watched every movie leading up to it"
BLACK PANTHER,3 April 2018,5/10,"This movie is not enough for the expectations advertised more and earn well enough Millions, am a huge marvel fan but this is not enough people expect from the movie one time watchable movie just a sci-fi action"
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2020,4/10,"I've seen pretty much all the MCU movies and this is - by far - the weakest of them all. Wooden acting acting (apart from Klaue), poor one-liners, and way too much over-the-top CGI (even by Marvel standards...) I understand why this movie is ""important""...and that's great...but that does not automatically make this a good film. I did enjoy some things - the history of Wakanda, the basic concept of the ""Black Panther"" in general, and the fact it didn't seem like every other MCU flick was a welcome change. I'd definitely be up for the sequel, and maybe now they've established this character they can actually concentrate on making a good movie instead of simply scoring points."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves. Everyone isn't lying when you hear the majority saying something is that great."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,4/10,"I couldn't enjoy this film since the begging when they present the form of choose their leader, why? because how can a hyper developed country, who is hided from the world because there is war outside, have a monarchy system , and choose their leader with a fight. The director insulted all African people with this, the message was very clear . Even if Africans have resources and high level life, the still will be savages who will prefer traditions over rationality. You can have a great capacities but if you don't belong to a real family (discrimination) and don't win the fight you don't deserve to lead a nation. If the winner of the fight is a real savage the people will have to follow him no matter what. This is contradictory if you want to present Wakanda as a advanced culture.
The visuals are and the mix of African culture and technology is great."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,4/10,"I understand why people want to like this film. There isn't enough cinema which focuses on African people or nations in a positive way, but this film really isn't doing that. All it is doing is perpetuating the myth that Africans believe that violence is a reasonable way to resolve disputes, and that ""might is right"".I find it very hard to believe that portraying the most advanced African nation as an isolationist dynastic monarchy/dictatorship which eschews democracy in favour of 1 on 1 armed combat, tribalism and nepotism is ""woke""? Really?This portrayal of ""advanced"" Africans primarily as warriors, rather than intellectuals (their technology is only achieved by their luck in living near the only know site containing Vibranium, rather than by their inherent ability as capable human beings to create an advanced society) is incredibly insulting and reinforces the racist stereotype of Africa as being socially backward and perpetually driven, and riven, by violence.Apart from that, it is a reasonably entertaining, if forgettable, film in the same vein as most other recent superhero offerings."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,4/10,"My god are superheroes becoming one sided and formulaic. Ryan Coogler seems to be good at recycling the most typical structure of a marvel superhero movie because he really missed a huge opportunity to make a good fun action packed flick. What we got instead was a boring, typical, overly technological and overly political deus ex machina fest of an attempt to make a marvel movie.Boring characters plague this movie. The main character played by Boseman is really really boring and his ""son of a king"" arc can be found in any other similar character. Its really boring to see. Michael Jordan is the exaggerated villain who is bad cause being bad is bad and he is bad and revenge and badness. We really shouldn't judge a movie based on how much we agree with its politics. Any movie that should not be political that is lowers the quality of its own story by pandering to one particular mindset.The cgi was at times too much and too bad for its own good. Technology is used very cheaply to get characters we are supposed to love out of sticky, impossible to survive situations and its really pathetic.Typical, boring and overly political for a superhero movie
4/10"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,7/10,"There are a lot to of things to say about out this movie but first and for most i just have to say this movie was good,i had fun with it and it's what i've come to expect from a marvel movie with a few surprises added.Now not that anything has to do with this but as an African myself i found this movie to be very accurate in it's depictions of Africa and the general culture than recent Hollywood films that have African lore or storylines so that was a nice bonus.First and foremost what i enjoyed from the movie was the characters this is one of the few movies whereby almost every character no matter main-cast or side cast was done right.I enjoyed Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther,Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia,Micheal B Jordan as Killmonger and special shoutout to Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as they portrayed their roles very well mostly because i didn't expect them to be so good.Now since this is a Marvel movie we all know
there is going to be humor and Black Panther truly did have some funny moments that were well executed and rather unexpected with made the movie more of a fun time to watch,BUT AGAIN since this is a Marvel movie there was some campy and unneeded humor which toke away some of the seriousness of
the movie sometimes and just uneven,and it can be disappointing that Marvel still don't know how to balance funny moments and serious moments sometimes.However the action was very good,Black Panther has some of the most enjoyable action sequences since Captain America: Civil War and i especially liked how some action scenes were gritty and grounded while other fight scenes had more of a comic book movie style which was very fun to see and also a bit different.Now for the story,i personally liked the story not just because it was different than any Marvel movie because of it's cast or location but because it related to the real whole in some aspects and we haven't seen that since Captain America: The Winter Soldier dealing with stuff like politics or social commentary so it was greatly appreciated and needed.The Villain Killmoger is easily in the Top 5 if not Top 3 of best Marvel villains or best villains in recent superhero movies,because who understood his motives for being the way he is and why he is doing the things he did.Micheal B Jordan was good in the role had felt like a genuine threat to Black Panther and Wakanda and his motives again weren't generic or cliche and his story is clear and fully explained in the movie.As for the bad things in the movie well,i didn't find anything that was a huge problem with the movie however this was not a perfect film.I already stated that some of the humor was forced and it doesn't seem like Marvel is learning from this also some character motivations for me shifted too quickly or easily for my liking,what i mean is during the course of the movie some events may lead a character to change during the course of the movie which seems weirdly easy and almost rushed for the sake of it this goes for Black Panther himself and Daniel Kaluuya's character but luckily it was too bad that it took your focus off the movie and another thing is certain things are not explained in the movie like the spiritual aspect is not explained and certain plot points come out of nowhere and the movie just expects you to be okay with this which is just super lazy.Also these maybe nitpicks but some of the special effects look weird and some of the African accents are exaggerated (don't know maybe because i'm African and i notice this stuff).Now as i said the movie is pure Marvel 101 but it is different in how it executes things like the villain and how the hero grows from his challenges and learns from his mistakes which is good story-telling and the world of Wakanda was well detailed and again the African culture aspect of the film as super on point and the world building was well done and sets up the future of Black Panther without being forced.Some may say this is a typical Marvel movie and some of that is true but with over 10 films from Marvel it is nice too see that there can be new concepts and ideas to explore while maintaining the humor,action and well done story-telling that most Marvel movie have and can't wait for the future."
BLACK PANTHER,14 December 2018,10/10,"Firstly,I don't care what the haters out there say about this movie I loved it! This movie is freakin awesome! Love the cult culture that their input into this movie and also the main protoganist played by chadwick boseman is doing a freakin good job at being a black panther i don't wanna to spoil anything my rating is 10/10"

BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,,"I am as big of a Marvel fan as it gets and it pains me to admit that movie is very below average in every way that matters for a film. It places a warped political commentary first and foremost and delivers intelligent entertainment a far second. In this already divisive era, we deserve better than this from Marvel. Those praising the film are doing so with a blatant agenda...not because it is good cinema!"
BLACK PANTHER,8 February 2021,10/10,"1 of the best made films i've seen in a long time .
written, cast, directed like a major movie but not enough people know it was made .
i'm so glad there will be a sequel
can hardly wait ."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,8/10,"A good one ,on his kind. Picture was amazing. Danai Jekesai Gurira, was her best point os far. She is so good. Worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Good scenes, CGI and costumes. Average cliche story and characters."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,I've watched it a few times now and love it. I love everything about it. So thankful this film was done.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I loved this movie and there is nothing the ""dislike"" people can do about it. For some reason, comments of praise get ""dislikes"" and negative comments get ""likes"". Come at me. I LOVE this movie.Black folk have finally got their Marvel movie...and it just may be the BEST Marvel movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 November 2018,7/10,"A very solid film, but nothing new here. Wakanda is a cool setting and the cast is pretty good. Problem is I have had no desire to rewatch it. I find with a lot of marvel films they're great to watch once, at a push twice, but other than that not so much.The action is good and the story is watchable. Problem is it's nothing we haven't seen before. It's all by the numbers but done pretty well.When you compare it to Thor Ragnarock as well there's little competition.Definitely give it a watch, the real black panthers may be more interesting though."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,6/10,"Black Panther - ""Black Panther"" is probably one of the most dazzling films ever. It delivers in enjoyment, and is the best crafted superhero movie ever, with the exception of ""Logan"" (2017)."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2020,9/10,I knew next to nothing about Black Panther coming into this flick. My first and only exposure was via Captain America: Civil War.The acting was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed the story-line. I also liked the fact that they had strong kick-ass African women characters. (I suspect this is why so many male users gave this film such low review scores. Poor things.)I am happy to see a Black Panther II on the boards. Definitely looking forwarding to watching it.
BLACK PANTHER,30 October 2019,,"Producer Kevin Feige (p.g.a.) brings ""Creed"" director Ryan Coogler and his teammates into the Marvel universe with this highly entertaining goody of high-profile 'Hollywood' science-fiction-action.The result entertains on all levels and mostly as a stand-alone 'Marvel' picture; even receiving the first 'Best Picture' Academy Award nomination at the 91st 'Oscars' for Marvel Studios, founded 1993."
BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,2/10,"I read that this film made over a billion dollars. If that's true then I don't understand why or how. This movie brings nothing new to the table in terms of anything. It feels to me like a forced replacement for Iron Man, albeit with an all black cast now.The story doesn't make a lot of logical sense. Poor dialogue, I actually laughed out loud at the antagonist in one scene when he yells ""Sup!?"" to Black Panther. The end of the film turns into a unfinished looking, cgi cartoon.Watch ""Coming to America"" with Eddie Murphy instead. Same feel, same characters, much better movie. This film doesn't deserve a 7.4 sheeple."
BLACK PANTHER,24 October 2018,8/10,"The story is the Lost Heir Who Comes to Claim His Kingdom, one of the most used plots in all genres. Here it's a well done fantasy-scifi, with better than average writing for the genre, and only mildly overdone fight scenes. For once, the CGI is justified by the story, which would be impossible to present convincingly without it. The movie uses all the tropes and clich√©s we've come to expect from the Marvel comic book universe, and takes them seriously but not solemnly. Striking visuals, beautiful design, pretty good acting, and generally unintrusive music help to make this an entertaining movie. ***"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,4/10,Judging this film solely on its entertainment value and in comparison to other films in the MCU and you'll see it's barely serviceable. Black Panther himself was a complete bore. Almost nothing the guy did got a reaction out of me. I was looking forward to Michael B Jordan's performance and I was so disappointed. It was totally one note and uninspired. The CGI was terrible as well. Watching Black Panther jump around reminded me of Harry Potter in the first film playing Quidditch. And the technology displayed was way too overdone. They could've downplayed it a little.This will go right along with Iron Man 3 for the weakest films so far in the Marvel Collective.
BLACK PANTHER,28 July 2018,1/10,The story is ridiculous. It seems like they made the manuscript in fifteen minutes. Just to make a black superhero movie hoping it will earn a lot of money. Which it did. Unfortunately people tend to watch Hollywood movies without bringing any taste of brain matter.The technology of the Wakanda is even more stupid. The cgi movement of the characters is looks fake. The accent of the actors are terrible. Overacting is definitely the main problem. It's like a bunch of rich kids making a debut movie and never having acted in their life.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,"Looking at the 1 star reviews exemplifies why this movie is important. This is far, FAR from the worst Marvel movie even if it's not the best as well, but it's definitely alongside the better ones because of how great the villain is and how effective and well realized Wakanda is as a scenario and a plot device, which makes the overall story stand out among other superhero flicks. Those that complain about the politics are stupid since it's an integral element of the characters. That said, only if you have some prejudice this aspect would trigger you since in it's heart this is still an action blockbuster focused in entertainment and it delivers, there's a ton a charm in the cast and the film is fluid and fun, the moving scenes are poignant without dragging and the comedy is used with precision, don't expect another Ragnarok.The worse about the movie is that it is a bit predictable and some visual fx look a bit dated but hardly something that would completely ruin my enjoyment. Wakanda Forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,8/10,"After the death of his father, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), returns home to the isolated and technologically-advanced African land of Wakanda, to take his place on the throne. The appearance of a powerful enemy threatens T'Challa's place as king, Wakanda, and the whole world.Our take: See it in theaters.
Post credit scene? There's technically a mid-credits scene. And a post credit scene. It's Marvel movie, just stay.
There is no doubt that you should see Black Panther and you should see it in theaters. It is a culturally groundbreaking film that deserves, and needs, support. It's a fresh look at the beauty of a movie with a nearly all-black cast. However, it doesn't escape some of the major Marvel pitfalls of the last ten years.On the positive side, Marvel has finally cracked the code on origin stories - instead of getting bogged down with a full-fledged introductory movie, they introduced T'Challa in an earlier film. It worked for Sony's Spider-Man: Homecoming, and it works here.The visuals are extraordinary, and much like Avatar, they are best viewed in 3-D or IMAX. One cannot watch the film without appreciating the costume designers, make-up artists, and production design teams. It's a masterpiece in all of these regards.Yet, the film has issues that can't be easily ignored. Black Panther's plot is a throwaway when taken in the grand scheme of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Many viewers going into the film know that T'Challa will persevere as the Balck Panther and king of Wakanda leading into Infinity War. As such, any tension that could have existed is non-existent. Even for those that weren't armed with this particular knowledge, it was incredibly contrived and predictable. It's a low-stakes film and that's felt throughout.In some ways, Killmongerer (Michael B. Jordan) is a step up from previous Marvel villains. Fueled by the anger stemming from years of oppression, he is the most relatable human antagonist that Marvel has ever seen on screen. Yet, none of that changes the fact that he is a disposable-one-film, one-dimensional villain.And failing where most Marvel films excel, the film's score leaves more to be desired. It makes The Amazing Spider-Man's score seem decent, and that's saying something. Another note to make about the film is how carefully utilized the few non-POC characters are. The presence of Martin Freeman (as Everett K. Ross) and Andy Serkis (as Ulysses Klaue) in this cast can't be overlooked, but the filmmakers knew what to do with them. They are background characters, but they didn't seem to be there superfluously. They didn't draw attention to their presence in exceptionally negative or positive ways. They were the token white men in a diverse cast, but it was tastefully done.Featuring: an original soundtrack curated by Kendrick Lamar."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2020,4/10,"How has no one commented on how bad Michael B. Jordan was in this movie? His character was terrible and he acting was even worse. I've always thought he was a very over hyped actor though. The movie would've been better with a different person as the ""bad guy"" in my opinion."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2021,10/10,"Friends kept telling me I had to see Black Panther for it's diversity, but it wasn't until a friend in that diversity realm told me the real reason I had to see it - she said it was a well-told story with heart.So I watched it. And again. Black Panther was the first Marvel movie I've seen that kept me entranced from beginning to end. The story is strong, the characters believable in a hero-packed storyline. And yes, it was well-told and it had a lot of heart. So much so, I talked of nothing else for weeks.Chadwick Boseman, T'Challa / the Black Panther, played an incredible role, and I know there are many who would challenge me on this, but Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's science geek sister, Shuri, stole every scene she was in. Her character was the antithesis of your average science geeky sister. She was brilliant, witty, and knew how to give a compliment or a friendly jab. Fantastic dialogue and acting.Chadwick will be sorely missed in the film world."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Too much hype for a so so movie. they use technology from a star trek movie that does not fit with the times of the movie. too bad ,I was expecting better"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"Black Panther is really just another predictable and average Marvel movie. Most Marvel movies I find enjoyable to a certain extent, and would usually rate a 6 or 7/10, but this movie falls short. The characters are weak, the writing and story are quite bland, the acting is whatever, and Black Panther himself is meh. The entire movie is really just a whole bunch of average and boring series of events that follow the cookie cutter format of any other superhero movie. What makes this movie slightly worse than your average superhero movie, is that the humor is terrible and it takes itself far too seriously. We are even treated to a ""What are those?!"" joke near the middle of the film. Overall, Black Panther is a slighlty below average film that you really don't have to watch. P.S. There is no meaningful political commentary in this film. Don't listen to the people that say there is."
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2018,7/10,"What is with all of these 1 star reviews? Have these people actually seen a truly terrible movie? Based on production values alone it deserves a minimun of a 5 or 6, and then go from there. I don't often take the time to write reviews, but after reading some of the 1 stars I had to take a moment to say it's entertaining, and frankly no different than all the other Marvrel movies. It's too long and dragged in some spots? They all do. Unbelievable premise? You have a hard time accepting a technologically advanced kingdom hidden in Africa but no problem accepting a Norse God from a distant planet coming to Earth to save the day? Fight scenes use heavy CGI? No duh. Bad acting? Strongly disagree. It's just like any other Marvel movie, Give it a try."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,3/10,"Why all this hype for this movie? I sat down with my sister to watch this, both really looking forward to it. She loves superhero movies, and I grew up reading Marvel including Black Panther comics which I loved, and I love what Marvel have done with the MCU, but...What was this? If I as a white man had done ""comedy Nigerian student accountant"" accents like the Wakandians did in the film, I would be called racist. We actually started laughing as they spoke, after a few nervous glances at each other.Everyone behaved like they had a pole up their collective behinds, and I know many of them are very good actors, such as Angela Bassett who was fantastic in AHS. Who let Andy Serkis was off the lead and told him to perform like a panto villain who thought he was playing a pirate. The only credit must go to Michael B. Jordan who turned in another good performance, and Letitia Wright as Panthers sister Shuri.After the movie my sister and I had a chat about what we'd just seen, and apart from the general disappointment, the over-riding feeling we were left with was... If the casts colour had been reversed, the film would be branded as racist.Bottom line: although I understand for an American movie this was a major thing cast wise, the casts acting was generally poor. As a Marvel film this was uneven and disappointing. And when the credits had rolled we were left with a bad taste in our mouths saying almost in unison that we won't be watching that again."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,10/10,"Walking out of the cinema, I was gutted to be frank. This was an amazing movie by all means, it had everything you could want from this movie. You have amazing performances by everybody, best villain in MCU, beautiful visuals, action that made you grab your seat.
Movie showed that every hero isn't unstoppable, they too are people, who get hurt in major ways. You understand villain's motivations and why he's doing all of it. It actually feels like the villain isn't a villain, he doesn't have an ""evil"" plan to rule everything. He's trying to fix things for others, that he didn't have.
Every character has soul in them and have a reason to exist in this movie. Actions have consequences, which will determine others doings.It's not an over the top superhero movie. It shows us character and the impact of everybody."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,4/10,"I was looking forward to Black Panther last year when it was announced, but as the release came closer, it became clear that the marketing team was working overtime. In fact, it became suspiciously clear that the movie may be compensating for something.And also in fact, I admit being turned off because every web page I visited, every trailer I wanted to see, everywhere I turned, Black Panther's ads were in my face worse than a mobile service provider or insurance ad. At least those didn't take over what I am trying to read.So, seriously, I knew there was going to be political and social messages, I can't think of any Marvel or DC superhero movie that doesn't have one. I accept that the atrocities that have happened and happen today in Africa can be powerfully addressed in a mainstream movie, indeed I was looking forward to it.What I think is a shame is how that chance was buried beneath magical technology. I know, I know. The comic book version made it work. On big screen, the costume-change was more absurd than when Wonder Woman spun around in a blast of light. And I know so many of the others in the Marvel universe have blingie wardrobe swapping also, so why should this movie's bother me?Because it distracts from the already stressed-out plot. I wouldn't begrudge an ethnic or gender group the privilege to share the same insta-powers and unbelievable technology or give airtime to diversity (I'm still waiting for Colossus to come out!) but in this case, Marvel did the genre a disservice. Why oh why wasn't I consulted on these nuances?Just as Marvel Studio spent too much money on marketing, they spent too much money on focus groups. They are trying to appeal to a specific audience and yet maintain balance and it doesn't work. What could have been a beautiful and strong story ends up being overhyped, muddied, and ultimately ungraceful in the face of a diverse culture's own depth of flavor and strength.I agree with Roger Moore's Metacritic score of 63, and I still look forward to future additions to the Black Panther series, with hopefully more elegant approaches and culturally worthy scripting.Oh, and while the 'white boy' comment maybe culturally authentic, it was just as unwelcome as the 'n'-word.Edit: And btw while Blade was the first black Marvel hero on screen, nobody bothers to mention Storm being the first AFRICAN hero on screen, but gosh all the street-racer thug wannabes can't relate to her much, not enough 'tude."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,6/10,"The movie does not stand anywhere near other superhero intro movies as compared to Ironman, Thor, Spiderman or Captain America. Black Panther starts on a sound story line but looses it grip gradually reaching till the end. The things that can be applauded are visual effects. Marvel has successfully rendered WAKANDA's scenic beauty. If you are a marvel fan you can go ahead to see this movie else otherwise it's just a contributor and add-on of a superhero in the ultimate fair of superheros ""Avengers - Infinity War""."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,2/10,Same cookie cutter Marvel formula. Basically Iron Man all over again. Rich guy with cool suit and tech fights villain who winds up in the same suit with the same tech. Worst of all the CGI in this movie is terrible. Wakanda looks like something out of a Star Wars prequel. The fight scenes look so fake and cartoonish. Whomever is fighting looks so rubbery and fake. the bad CGI takes you out of the fantasy in a jarring fashion.terrible movie.
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,8/10,"Director Ryan Coogler leads an ensemble cast in a very ambiguous film with a fantastic soundtrack, characters, and well-choreographed action. The CGI seems unfinished, however."
BLACK PANTHER,21 November 2018,8/10,I really enjoyed this film.It got me from start.Good story and great acting.
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2019,6/10,"I watched this movie in cinemas a little late after all the hype. My expectations where extremely high due to all the anticipation from critics and fans alike.The first half of this movie is great. It's entertaining, thrilling and original. The music fits the film greatly and Chadwick does great portraying black panther.However, the film for me completely loses it after the second half. As the first half was so original, I was excited to see what the second half was going to be like. It just turned into your average run of the mill movie. The story of the king trying to get back his throne which was stollen from him has been done a million times.When the film ended, I didn't understand all the hype. Yes the first half was good, but the second half really ranked. However it wasn't boring nor bad really. Just disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,27 October 2020,4/10,Is it me or is this Just playing racist. they are biggin black people up.While i think that it is a fair eford. I also think that the emphasis is too much on the black empowerment. So that basically makes it a political movie rather then a superhero movie.As in this Day and age. Being political isn't the best way for Hollywood to move on. Giving equal opportunity is a good drive. but that doesn't mean necessary to use White gold to make a movie like this
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,8/10,"Chadwick Boseman is dead... rest in peace, rest in power. Plot is great and thrilling. Effects are good. Actors are good"
BLACK PANTHER,27 September 2020,9/10,"The people say it's just a movie. But was rocky just a movie? Or did it inspire? It gives a brilliant message about ammending mistakes and taking ur place in the world, the two leads Chadwick and Michael are amazing and the rest are pretty awesome too, the direction Ryan coogler decided to go in was great, this is easily the best superhero movie from a filmmaking perspective"
BLACK PANTHER,19 June 2021,8/10,"Writing was good, great music(Love kendrick lamar) and score(if you dont like then you have bad choice or your range of music is very limited) directing was good, act 3 action was dull, CGI in last fight in act 3 was mef bcz of setting they choosed, great acting, if you dont like this then trudt me you will fail film school, Ryan is very intellectual and intelligent guy. Movie celebrates clothes, movie celebrates music, it take inspiration from african culture for every department possible in the film, and it has some jack kirby production design vibe too!! So if you dont understand my review then you prob casual So go watch it with open mind!! TRUST THIS WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY!! Ryan coogler's mark can be seen in every department of the movie!!!!!! And he will get 100% freedom in next one and this movie dont care about your world view, this movie has kindness but also it has core human values with being unapologetic!! Movie is MATURE, very carefully written, i watched it when i was 17 and till now i watched it more then 5 times, i really understand ryan's vision and he nailed it!! Chadwick's character was written from very realistic perspective! He tried to do right thing everytime, and he understands nobody is perfect with more empathetic then other, you might change the world, be open to new ideas...... this are core human values that everyone should have!! TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS DEEPER THEN 1 TO 5 STAR reviews!! With unbiased viewpoint i can tell you casual to die hard fans they will give it from 6 to 10!! This movie was not boring, not at all but if you were raised with conservative principles, then obviously you will hate this movie bcz its spreads the message of accepting new ideas and be more empathetic bcz not all people are bad inherently, that does not mean killmonger aint bad, he killed people, and he kept going to that route and ya he did not deserved that childhood!! Chadwick loved his dad and always believed in him and his ideology but his son also believed in HELPING! Yes people will always tell you to do certain things, but if you believe in yourself in HELPING others in right way then you must do the right thing!! Learn from msitake, learn from past/history and move on with more progressive ideas! Thats how you make world better place and ryan understands that very well!! CONSERVATIVE IS ALL ABOUT CONSERVING YOU PAST IDEOLOGY, AND WE ALL KNOW PAST IDEOLOGY IS DIEASES, RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANSPHOBIC!! And if you dislike this that just will prove my point why you hate this movie or called it boring or not the hype bcz you are incapable to understand a character bcz this movie had some great moments as well!"
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"I might be biased because I care so much about good and possitive representation of minorities but this is genuinly the best and my favorite movie from the mcu. Maybe it's a bit political considering the times it came out with certain quotes about racism and slavery, colonizers and stuff, but that's why I like it, they made a good superhero movie tackling serious subject like racism is, not just regarding racism but also feminism as Dora Milaje and Okoye are a whole ass thing and I remember leaving the theater and feeling so empowered.....Honestly, I laughed, I cried, I love the action sequences, the cgi, the cast, the work behind cameras and how hard Coogler worked to make Wakanda realistic, it was beautiful to see honestly, I loved Black Panther for everything. Allow me to add to this that the OST is literally the best out of MCU too, Kendrick Lamar is an amazing artist!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"Took a few days to mull this review over. Visually this as impressive as a Marvel title gets, Wakanda brought to ife and it's beautiful. The let down is the somewhat predictable plot, as the early part of the film plays out it was easy to see how the end was to play out.This in mind the there is a lot packed into the 2hr 15 runtime, which oddly with the story, you find some parts seem drawn a little too much, leaving the final act far too predicatble and extremley busy.The casting is good and Michael B Jordan in particular impressive.It will be interesting to see further development of Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,14 January 2019,1/10,"Beside from the fact this movie cost a mountain of money and also made even bigger mountain of money - for me it's an epic failure.
Here are my 2 cents:
battle scenes were poorly made. Honestly there are way better hand to hand combat fights in TV shows (for example ""Into the Bad Lands"") rather than herethe story and plot were in best case mediocreeven the descent amount of humor and jokes common for comic based actions were missingThe worst thing in that movie was the acting. Don't get me wrong but for AAA blockbuster you can expect more convincing actors performance than this...In conclusion I will say I've found only two good things in the Black Panther:
The performance of Andy Serkis - top notch as alwaysI've watched it on HBO while laying on the couch ..."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,8/10,"Black Panther (2018): RevieeMarvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s 18th movie, marks the coming of age for the blockbuster churning studios. While the budget of $200 Mn reflects the confidence of the studio to create a solo movie for a not-so-famous Marvel hero, Box office collections (>$ 1bn) show that it has been rewarded nicely for the bet.Those who follow MCU movies, would know that Black Panther was introduced in Captain America: Civil War where he chases the Captain and Bucky in a thrilling action sequence. This movie follows the story after T'Challa's father dies in the bombing of UN building. The mantle passes on and so the story progresses..But, you are here for the review, right?Let me first get out the parts that suck. The plot which is predictable even before the first hint is dropped is a concern - Age old formula of succession, challenger, failure and the comeback (Didn't we see something very similar in Thor's 1st movie?)Most of the characters are also caricature (a doting mother, feisty girlfriend, priest with a past, betraying friend, loyal general, powerful enemy, the original enemy becoming an ally for honour and the sidekicks).The underlying narrative about oppression of the black people by colonists and thus the payback; could've been handled much more subtly, than 'in your face' dialogues.However, this doesn't make the movie unwatchable. Let me list down 5 reasons below, as to why you should still watch this movie.1. Title credits - Movie starts with tribal beats and the story of Wakanda which is being told by T'Chaka to T'Challa. The visuals made with shape-changing vibranium nanites lend a magical effect and prepare the audience for the VFX that follows. Nicely done!2. T'Challa, Shuri and Ulysses Klaue - The 3 characters which stand out.First, the protagonist himself T'Challa (The Black Panther), groomed to be king from a young age himself, he's unusually subdued, for a Superhero. There's no glimpse of any smugness or over-confidence which we saw in Thor. If anything, there's a subtle pride and a bit of self-doubt, which is very well portrayed by Chadwick Boseman. Many scenes which depict his self-depreciation adds to the humour and draw empathy from the audience.Second, 'Shuri' the young teenage genius to whom the myriad inventions in the whole of Wakanda is attributed to, is solely responsible for bringing in some fun element in the movie. Acting as Q, the doctor and the sidekick, she aces in her role and steals the scene whenever present. Well done, Letitia Wright.Third and my favourite character in the movie is portrayed by the master Andy Serkis. The man, who rarely gets to play himself as a human is seen enjoying his role as Ulysses so much, that as the audience I was the most disappointed when he died. The raw energy he brings, lights up the screen and he kicks a** even with just 1 hand. Sample this dialogue to his driver 'Play some music. Do you think this is a funeral?', when he's being chased to be killed. He gets ample screen time here (not just a cameo which we saw in Avengers: Age of Ultron)3. Action sequence - 3 to 4 brilliantly done action sequences, other than the hand to hand combat ones. Special mention to the one shot in South Korea. If only, DC learns something from this!4. The Dream sequences - They appear thrice. Twice for T'Challa and once for Erik Killmonger. I'm not sure how they do it, but the 'aurora' effect in the sky is just unbelievable. Credit to the VFX team, wherever they may be situated.5. Africa - the simplicity, the music and nature - The tap and the rhythm, you feel it right from the start. Every time it changes, the mood and the setting changes. Yes, there are few American rock songs in between. But, the director keeps coming back to the simple instruments. They are so very addictive. Africa, showcased through rolling hills, snow-capped mountains, jaw dropping waterfalls and rivers takes us right back to 'The Lion King'. For me, it did bring back few memories from KenyaSo, go ahead and watch this old school, but newly made Action movie. Personally recommended.P.S. - The IMDB Trivia mentions that the scenes supposed to be in Africa, have in fact, been shot in Georgia. But, ignore that."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"A definitely more diverse approach to the superheroes universe of Marvel. I welcomed this like a breeze of fresh air, and not only because of the aforementioned diversity of the characters but because of the quality of the movie as such. After being misrepresented lately by dull and ridiculous movies like the last installments of Captain America and Thor, the famous entertainment company can now promote Black Panther as a good sign of recovery.Well acted, fun, humorous and passionate movie. This time Marvel allocates the epic and eternal battle of good and evil in the African continent, having its people as the protagonists of the story. Combining science fiction and fantasy, the decently written script leads the spectators through a well passed course of actions, supported with outstanding visual effects and a colorful and imaginative depiction of a richly recreated African universe.A most welcome addition to a cinematic universe in need of fresh renovation."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"Ok, I get that they want to introduce the character and give it an arc. But that didn't happen for Hulk (In an ""Avengers"" scheme, although it should have) and it sure as hell wasn't necessary for this one.
The movie was WAY too long, boring and just redundant. Everything past the 30 minute mark was just a waste of time and money.
They grossly overplayed the ""African"" aspect and it just felt like it was shoved in your face in every single chance they got. Hell, even Ross (Martin Freeman's character) felt to be forced to recognize and be a part of the ""tribe"".
As a huge Marvel fan, I was incredibly excited to see this, see the universe expand. But I was hugely disappointed. 
The only thing I can commend in this movie are the visual effects and the music. Loved them."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"The pinned under the rubbles in Homecoming, Logan and Watchmen entire movie.
Those were emotional, but didn't make me cry.
But the relationship between T'Challa and Erik with their respective father made me cry.Among superhero movies I've watched, this is the best so farThe score for the reviews and ratings for this movie is kinda funky.
Just like Get Out, there are people that rated this too high or too low due to racial issue.
I say let's put that aside and judge this movie for it's quality as a movie.
Even the final message expressed by this movie, as said by T'Challa, is to build bridges to connect, help, and work together with everyone.But I digress,
Worthy of it's title as the best superhero movie so far (according to me), the actions, visual effects, and scale were amazing.
The music matches the tone of the scenes and overall enjoyable.The enemies are not ""faceless"" like Ultron's robots, Avenger's aliens, Suicide Squad's and Justice League's Dumb Whatever-Those-Things are, and this is my favorite aspect of the movie, actual enemies with personalities and ideas.The only ""flaws"" (not really but) to me are :
1. The villains were as interesting as Loki, but they were all dead. Pity.
2. Despite being a superhero movie, not much ""superheroing"" done. Well, this is the internal strife part so understandable.In conclusion : Watch it"
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,So much hype for a banal movie. Nothing interesting happens in more than 2 hours. Classic story with no surprises. No reason for such a poor movie to get so much attention.
BLACK PANTHER,17 November 2019,5/10,Good action and good acting. What ruined it for me was the political BS that they incorporated into the movie. It may come as a surprise to those that live under a rock but slavery ended over 150 years ago.
BLACK PANTHER,17 November 2019,5/10,Good action and acting. The political message was unmistakable and it turned me off from the movie. Overly incarcerated and policed huh.
BLACK PANTHER,30 January 2021,5/10,"Lot of extreme CGI, fights, action, but the story and character development let off. Oh yes, and what about the addition of the CIA agent: completely redundant. Soundtrack was nice though."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,4/10,"I am quite surprised how this movie did so much business? There is nothing new in the story. The writers have managed to put in a plot twist, but it's so poor it does not even surprise. It's like you already know it. Action sequences are a bit good, but too short. Acting is horrible. At best, this movie can be called average."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,10/10,"I watch Sci-Fi movies and my wife likes our traditional Punjabi movies. She watches hindi movies also which I have have started watching move infrequently. I have enjoyed this movie all thoroughly. My wife would have have gone to sleep if this was average Sci-Fi movie. 
Special effects amazing.
Fight scenes awesome.
Acting very nice.
I like the sister a lot and she felt like a sister to me. In which any movie in your life you have seen a beautiful women and felt her like a sister. I think this is out of current Hollywood world experience. 
General's comment of without doubt was something which hit right on the spot from duty point of view.
I will be sad if this does not win Oscars. Shape of water was nice but not that nice in comparison to this movie. 
Mother's role was very motherly, is it not awesome?
I would have given it 11 stars if there was a choice.
I was not going to watch this movie and just by chance I saw the trailer on IMDB and I told my daughter this is worth it. Here she booked the ticket and sent me and my wife to the theater. I think those who are giving lesser stars are jealous that this movie is better than the movies they liked.
I will watch a sequel and another after this."
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,1/10,"First of all, I scrolled through at least 30 of the last reviews and none of them were higher than a 3. There's something fishy with the rating system here. Secondly, I didn't make it further than a half hour into the movie. It's just simply one of the worst implausible, race-baiting movies out there. Within 17 minutes, there are 2 allusions made to white men taking everything from Africans. Really? If this were the case in the movie, where were the Wakandans when Africans were selling off their own kind to the Europeans? For this movie to be plausible, they should make it a point that the Wakandans were complicit in the slave trade given their super advanced technology that could have stopped it at any time! This movie is so bogus... Wakandans with alien technology 100s of years in advance to the rest of the world, but their still wearing animal-tooth necklaces and wielding spears? And to top it all off, you see the Northern lights in central Africa!!There is NOTHING realistic in the scenarios offered by the director or the producers for that matter. This movie was made to placate the African American population, just like when you see a black princess in a European fairy tale... just not historically accurate and does nothing to give value to the ACTUAL traditions of Africans! When will they realize that when Europeans do this, it denigrates African cultures as being primitive and destroys the integrity of European history! Repunzel wasn't black. Snow White wasn't black. And NO African tribal hero was ever white!This movie is an insult to anyone with a brain! Pathetic"
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2019,4/10,"During my years of watching movies, IMDB disappointed me only twice. Once was Wonder Woman, once this.Actors actually made me feel uncomfortable for them, and man are the jokes NOT funny. I wasn't able to enjoy this movie despite my best effort to do so."
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2019,2/10,"Anyone reading this review, this movie aint good.
This movie wasnt made for real audience to enjoy, it was more motivated or used to power the politics. Atleast if not either of those then it was certainly full of controversial topics.
Also this was overhyped and still is.
It is as bad as Captain america Civil War or Iron man 3.Story was predictable and boring.Chasing, Fight, searching, chasing, death, revival, fight.
Thats my summary for the story.CharactersT'Challa was good for most of the part but he died and then wow, he came back alive.
We had angry man named Erik who wanted revenge for his dads death, thats realy new (sarcasm)
Ulysses Klaue, thief and murderer who screwed over everyone when time was right and in the end he got screwed over, talk about karma.
Everett K, well he realy did not have much point in the movie did he.My 2 stars go out for good CGI and okay acting."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,8/10,"The first thing I want to mention right on start is that anyone now wishing to go in cinema and watch it, shouldn't read reviews because I did it and almost quit going. I would make a big mistake. My note is a proof.
I watched it in 2D and that was my second mistake, other then listening to a reviews. Beautiful CGI, amazing fight scenes, lighting... just every visual aspect is a proper 3D material. Totally recommended. 
I saw a lot of comments of how movie was over-hyped and now I wonder, do we now review trailers or movies. If a trailer (which I intentionally didn't watch) is a bit wealthy with scenes, why would everyone go super strict with a movie. Watch it like you never even saw a trailer, I say.
Now the technicalities. Almost everything you would except from a Marvel movie was there. Interesting story, hero that is kinda mythical kinda technological (like fusion of Iron man and Captain America), amazing side characters, beautiful background story which is also beautifully told, landscapes, soundtrack, a touch of humor but not too much like in Ragnarok... ALMOST everything. 
One thing we really lacked was a true villain! A bit of evil, more arrogance, brutality, blood. We lacked a bit of conflict as well. Not a movie conflict because we had a whole lot of fighting but that theatrical conflict between protagonist and antagonist. 
One more, minor-ish complain is that some scenes, some tribe-related scenes, could be done with more usage of a native language. With just a few more even minor mistakes that are not even worth mentioning, I have to say I really enjoyed discovering Wakanda and watching Black Panther. And as I said, see it for yourself!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2020,6/10,"Before I start I'd like to say that I don't understand how this movie supports the political agenda that people are associating it with. This is not a people for people movie, it's not even a black people for black people movie, this movie (right up until the very end) supports a divided world and an anti-humanitarian message. The ""good"" guys of this movie aren't really the good guys. They are the people in power who have the means, but choose to not support the welfare of all people, not even all black people. The message of this movie is not clear, and it is not helped by the fact that most of this movie's characters' motivations are not clear.Let's start with the negatives. This movie at times is badly written. The characters are two dimensional, their motivations are unclear, and they are sometimes used solely as plot devices. Take Martin Freeman's character for example, who even is this guy? We know almost nothing about what kind of person he is, what he stands for, or why he is even in this movie. The moment that we learn something about him other than what's on the service is when we learn he used to be a pilot, then almost immediately they use him as a plot device to fly the plane to save Wakanda's secret weapons. Michael B. Jordan's character is also so under-realized. The sole explaination for his mentality is that his father got killed when he was a kid, how does this possibly explain why he became a CIA operative tasked with taking down developing nations from the inside? I understand his motivations for wanting to get payback from Wakanda for killing his father, but that doesn't explain why he has literally nothing positive in his personality. On the topic of his father dying, the father was literally doing the right thing. He saw that not just black people, but all people in other countries could use the technologies that Wakanda has and all the social process it could bring, yet he is portrayed as a gangster, a criminal, a traitor. Wakanda owes their entire culture to this metal that just so happened to exist where they colonized, and it had been there for millions of years before humans even evolved. What possible claim do these people have to vibranium other than the fact that they live where it exists? They shield their country to stop the risk of anybody discovering how much vibranium they have, but they justify it by saying it is not their way to share vibranium. What kind of self righteous attitude is this? Vibranium is depicted as a solution for all of societies problems, but the only way you could access vibranium is by being born in Wakanda. This is a conspiracy that Wakanda is choosing to hide from anybody who is not systematically chosen. Reminds me of how the pharmaceutical industry prices their medicines that people desperately need so high that only the rich can afford them, and anybody who can't is left to deal with it themselves. What sort of message is this movie trying to convey? Another thing this movie does wrong is the tonal inconsistency. There will be some serious scene then one character will say something to provide some comic relief but it just breaks from the immersion and then you realize that this is a Disney movie and that they need to sell toys. I could go on for so long about the negatives of this movie, but as for the positives, it's entertaining if you choose to turn a blind eye to all of the glaring problems with this movie. The high budget and the entertaining action scenes are a distraction to this movie's lack of artistic merit."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"We toddled off to see BLACK PANTHER and I renewed my Hoyts Seniors card and got in for nothing! Yay me! 
And it was worth every cent too.The Black Panther is the newly minted king of Wakanda, a super-dooper advanced country hidden in Africa like skull Island is hidden in the Pacific but there's no giant ape although there are ginormous CGI armoured rhinoceroses but more on them later.A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species but in this case, it being Africa, izza Leopard! So to remove any reference to colour (although the educated will know that black isn't actually a colour) King T'Challa could have been non-judgementally called 'Melanistic Leopard' but that doesn't, I suppose, have the same ring to it. Wakanda has heaps and heaps of a metal that I can't remember the name of but it's terribly, terribly useful and rare and it is the reason that they are so advanced. Aliens might've given it to them. Dunno. Can't remember that either. They also have some purple plants that give the king his Melanistic Leopard powers and this is just what the Dockers need. Except Nat Fyfe. He doesn't need it.There are also some fierce warrior chicks who are like Amazons but aren't from an island. They scowl (a lot!) and are the King's special bodyguards. But not like Colonel Gaddafi's bodyguards, at least I don't think so. There is a lovable sidekick who is a CIA operative and a nasty villain who is a Yarpie (obviously!)King T'Challa's father has just died and this sets the scene for the sort of conflict that is central to any Marvel movie. Yes, there is another claimant to the throne who appears and he has hundreds and hundreds of what appear to be little boils, each of which represent someone he killed. I think. Who they were or why they were killed I cannot recall, but he's from America, so anyone really.His father was killed by T'Challa's father so there's bad blood aplenty. T'Challa has a sister who is terribly good at inventing things like new Black Panther suits sort of like Tony Stark except she doesn't get to wear 'em and she's a chick..The new claimant wants to take over the world and right centuries of wrongs done to Africans and their descendants worldwide and violence is his weapon combined with other weapons made out of terribly, terribly useful and rare metal. And he wants to do it NOW! King T'Challa favours a more measured approach to world domination using a creeping goodness and mercy and understanding strategy. No-one is stepping up to redress the wrongs done to Australian Aboriginals, or first nations folk from other, more heavily armed, countries.In the finest tradition of Marvel there is a really big battle between the two forces, and the usurper has the CG ginormous rhinoceroses who cut a swathe though King T'Challa's forces but are tamed by someone that they used to know and she gets her face licked. They, the CG armour clad rhinos, don't look very real. Although I've never seen a real ginormous armoured rhinoceros so I might be judging them unfairly. In my view, the battle scene would've been heaps better if there had been a contingent of Welsh infantry singing 'Men of Harlech'. I suppose some will ponder upon who was good, and who was evil, or were either of them good or evil or on infinite variations of the two. But I didn't.Is it a parable? Does King T'Challa represent Martin Luther King? Does usurper-guy represent Malcolm X? Or the prophet Mohammed? Dunno. Is it any good?
Look. I may not have been part of the target demographic. Lots of clever and self important reviewers have compared it, favourably, to bees-knees. Me? Not so much. It's better'n Interstellar, but so is having an eyeball removed with a spoon that has just been licked by, say, Jabba the Hutt.A bit dull."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,10/10,"I seen all the Marvel Universe movies and I can easily say this title was the one that surprised me most, I went into this thinking this would be a boring chapter of the MU but was surprised, this was more meaningful, more storyline, more history of the character etc than any other title.I was pleasantly surprised and even after watching it prob 15 or 20 times I still enjoy the movie and can not wait for further development from this.Easy 10 from me."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,8/10,"Black Panther was not Marvels best but not the worst. The main plot of the film was very well developed and the twist about Killmonger in the middle of the film was also very interesting. I feel like there was more to explore but it was also a very unpredictable film.unlike some superhero movies you don't know what's about to happen. I feel like most of the characters were written in the film pretty well. One thing I don't like about this film was the way they treated the character Klaw. Killmonger's orgins was developed well, but I was disappointed with the way that they handled Klaw.The following is my opinion so don't judge 
 
I personally think Klaw shouldn't have been killed off so early in the film. I think Klaw should have used Killmonger to get in to Wakanda. Then Klaw should be trying to steal Vibranium and other tech and then Klaw finds Shuri's lab and takes the Golden Jaguar suit and gives it to Killmonger. He then uses Killmonger as his body guard or muscle while he gets further into plan of stealing vibranuim. But as the movie goes on Killmonger realizes he is being mistreated and desides to overthrow Klaw and ends up killing him. Than Killmonger would be the main villain for the last 20 minutes or so. Back to my actual review... They did a good job of balancing serious scenes and comedic scenes I loved all of the characters Sheri was my favorite and overall the movie was pretty good there were some other things that bugged me as I was watching it. One thing was how the hell are they so rich they've never shared their tech with the rest of the world. So why do the have so much MONEY?!!? Also I was disappointed that they didn't even introduce the soul stone. Now yeah we now know that it's not in Wakanda but up next is infinity war so will they have enough time to introduce it in Infinity War?"
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2020,7/10,"Black Panther was fun to watch, but not riveting by any stretch. It was a visual splendour with athletic bodies, fun choreography and an easy to follow story line. The magic and ancestral stuff extends the world of possible to the world of the impossible. The best part, the kiss at the end. Such lips! Otherwise, this is a bit like the Lion King meets sci-fi. Even the sound track is reminiscent of the Lion King. In the end, it was political correctness in hot suits."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,7/10,"The movie as a whole was just good. As many reviews have said, the movie lacked a true villain, and had somewhat weak storyline. This felt similar to spiderman 3, and there were too many characters brought in at once. The Black Panther in Civil War was what i was expecting here, that is NOT what I got. He seemed to lack everything we loved about him in Civil war. At times the movie was too preachy on civil rights. Nothing wrong with that, but I am trying to escape current politics, and nowadays it seems to be everywhere. Some issues with this movie. At time i felt like the music did not match what was going on in the film. Do you really expect Kendrick Lamar to be playing in a South Korean gangster bar? (its possible, BUT likely...probably not) Not once did i ever feel that the villains in this were badass, had a true motive or even evil. Maybe because I compare them to the Winter Soldier, who was an AWESOME villain. Michael B Jordan was bland and one tone throughout. He does provide great stare downs before a fight, not much after that. Not to mention i couldnt stop thinking about the Human Torch during the movie.There are things i did like; the women were badass, T'Challas sister stole the show for me, and the visuals were incredible. When the black panther showed up he was awesome. Wish his fight choreography was better though. I believe all the hype on this movie is due to it being released at the perfect time with all of the social movements occurring over the past two years (#OscarsSoWhite), and had strong female representation (#MeToo). It is also a Marvel Movie, that alone carries its weight in gold. It was a recipe for a Big Box Office Hit."
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2018,10/10,"Loved this movie! Incredible.. I went to see ""just another marvel movie"", but got something much deeper with a lot of meaning. This movie was worth seeing and will stand the test of time!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,3/10,I thought the special effects were awesome but the story was kinda rushed in the end.
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,1/10,"I missed my chance to see the movie when it was in the theaters. When it got added to Netflix, I was very eager to watch it. Well, as the title of this review indicates, it was quite a disappointment. The first part of the movie took a bit too long to set up the background information about Wakanda and T'Challa. Then, there a scene right out of 007 movie, where the hero is introduced to new gadgets that we'll see later in the movie. Be grudgingly I bought into that. Then came the first ""real"" action scene that took place in Korea. After seeing that mess, I just couldn't bare to watch any more of it. I know many people have given this movie high marks and truly enjoyed it. For me, it felt like a nut with a very hard shell. Maybe if I managed to crack through the shell, I would have found a very tasty, satisfying nut. However, it really did not seem to be worth the effort."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,2/10,"Considering the magnificence of Coogler's Fruitvale Station -- a deeply moving piece of art -- it's hard to understand how this movie could exert so little effort in even the most rudimentary building up of characters and stakes that matter to those characters and to the audience. I could not figure out who I was supposed to root for or why. And then there's the credibility of this country that is sort of known about in the outside world and sort of not known about, and glowing blue airships taking off over American cities with only a couple of kids in a basketball court noticing. And how exactly does the Vibranium economy work and enable the building of those magnificent skyscrapers? (Two stars instead of one is because of the gorgeous exhilarating shot of the ship landing in the city for the first time.) And why on a movie of this budget couldn't somebody hire a really good dialect coach to get the accents uniform and convincing? Given the billion dollars and the worldwide acclaim I must be wrong. Or maybe I was out of the room when they did the hypnotizing."
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2021,4/10,"Not sure this movie will age well. The premise of not helping the rest of the planet with their technology and blaming those pesky whites for being the cause of all evil in the world will sour quickly.Why are they fighting with knives and spears like savages? Don't they live in the most technologically advanced place in earth? (The ships have guns)Why are they not helping the rest of the African nations? Don't some Africans have to walk 10 miles to get some water in most places and eat grass! Selfish!Out of the two bad guys, did they really have to make one a white South African. Careful now.This movie was vastly overrated but I can understand that with today's racial climate.Woofing like dogs and the shoulder dance was embarrassing.I thought Chadwick did a great job and made the role his own so well done to him. I look forward to seeing him again.More of a local tribal squabble than a superhero movie but it was Ok. Meh.Anyway, I'm off to send ¬£5 to Africa so they can build a well. Thanks a lot Wakanda."
BLACK PANTHER,18 September 2018,4/10,"The title sums it up neatly. It is the first superhero blockbuster where all the protagonists are not just black, but they also speak in African accent and reside in a secret location somewhere in Africa where technology is highly advanced far beyond the rest of humanity. Never before have I seen Africa in such a way, I tend to associate the sub-Saharan part of the continent with being the most undeveloped and trouble-ridden part of the world so the mere idea gave me a bit of a cultural shock, my mind was somewhat blown and I felt those dark corners of my mind where these ideas reside enlightened by new possibilities. Unfortunately this is where the originality begins and ends. The movie is a boring cliche superhero tale, and I understand it was over-hyped for pushing its politically correct agenda. Wonder woman was a much better superhero movie while also serving a politically correct agenda."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2018,1/10,"This movie was over much hyped by critics due to reasons nothing to do with the actual film. This film is a trash. Story which is cheesy, cliche dialogues, poor casting and bland acting makes this movie an abomination. There is no panther in this but just a Black Void."
BLACK PANTHER,6 February 2019,,"Lasted an hour before I bailed. I like the cast but the movie is done in by terrible writing that most of the actors could not overcome. Halfway through the film and there's little to no character development. I have no reason to care about 99.9% of the people on the screen. As a huge fan of the preceding films, I expected much more from Black Panther. Very disappointing. The hype and over-the-top praise of this movie is misplaced."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,4/10,"This is one of those odd movies where I started out mentally giving it a 9, and it proceeded to whittle away at that number until I was left stuck between 4 and 5-stars. I settled on 4.The only memorable performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, with Forest Whitaker contributing a decent performance, for what time he had on screen.Once they started down the PC/SJW path I rapidly lost interest in the movie, especially because most of the ""facts"" they spewed out are historically and factually incorrect. But let's not let that get in the way of inciting racial hatred and deluding people into accepting fantasy as reality.Some of the fight choreography was lifted straight from The Winter Soldier, and overall left me feeling decidedly ""Meh"" about the whole deal.Yet again we get the ""strong, intelligent women show evil/uncertain men how the world should work"" routine. That narrative has gotten so old that it's now past boring.A film with huge promise ruined by social justice commentary, lack of character arcs in all but one or two places, and amateurish fight scenes. Watch it if you have nothing better to do. But you won't watch it twice."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Being an avid book reader, I have watched all but 2 or 3 comic book adaptations since the late 1970s. I have witnessed the change in tone and approach, as well as the the whole world-building process take root in the recent adaptations as the times inevitably changed. What Marvel has done so far is much more commendable than DC, and many examples of Marvel movies of the last 10 years are the living proof of that. However, not all of these adaptations are on par with what we may get to call all-time greats, and I am afraid -despite all the high grades given to the movie by critics- Black Panther is one of them. Black Panther actually happens to be one of my favorite characters along with Thor, a few X-men and Green Lantern. Time and again, I have read it with utter joy and fulfillment, and have always looked forward to the next issue. Therefore, this movie was one which I looked forward to with extreme enthusiasm. And maybe it was this same enthusiasm that ruined the movie for me, but I sincerely doubt it. So, as to how I see the movie:OK, so the casting is right on target, no quarrels there. And so are the visual effects and the setting of the story. However, the story is somewhat shallow, and needlessly comedic at places where it shouldn't be.Marvel (Disney) has lately started to follow a certain pattern of writing scripts, just like in the Bond movies. A hero, a romantic interest, a villain, a side-kick (or someone who takes on the role of Q from those Bond movies), a moral dilemma... and we are set. This one here is no different, only -as I have said before- somewhat shallow. Also, there happens to be more than one coincidental occurrence which make the story a lot less believable, if you care about those things. All of a sudden, an unexpected piece falls into place, a miraculous twist happens, someone appears out of thin air, and voila... all is well.The movie that could have delivered so much more at us, ends up delivering a script which can be summarized in just 2 sentences, and a story full of plot holes.So, how come such a movie garner so much praise, and such high marks? I dunno, honestly, but I have a theory. Ultimately, I feel like it would be safe to say that this movie was sort of a hype created to promote a black super hero in these trying times and during the re-emergence of needless and disturbing racial tendencies. It was during these times the movie was shot and as such promoted to emphasize equality and fairness among all people. Which is all good and fine, but it still could have done that with a stronger script, with a more coherent and fuller story. The fact that it gets so many high notes is not because of the film that it is, but because of the film it was intended to be. At least, this is my take on the movie, and how the film was reviewed so highly.I just hope the next installment in the Black Panther saga delivers more, just like the Winter Soldier delivered after the first Captain America adaptation."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2019,8/10,"Story is good , acting is good , visuals are awesome but more awesome thing is the technology advancement they have shown in the movie ... truly treat to watch and this is the thing I like about marvel studios and also after all iron man movies in terms of technology view ,black panther Is on next list now"
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2019,1/10,So to see what is this fuss I watched black panther. One thing I want to tell here is that I will not abandon the movie by not watching it fully no matter how bad the film is. Black panther is one like that. The story line is too ancient and dullful. Only the best part is background score. Otherwise I would have abandoned by breaking my habit.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,10/10,"I absolutely loved this movie and I can't agree with anything that the haters say. It's a combination of a few things - that's why it's so amazing. It has a decent story that is properly developed (unlike a lot of action movies that focus on effects only), the effects are mind-blowing, the outfits are beautiful, the sets are stunning, and I loved the acting. Why are people saying the acting was terrible? I actually LOVED how authentic the actors played, better than many white actors. And the accents are a great addition to it. Oh, and let's not forget the humor. There were a lot of effortless funny lines.
I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie if I tried. Brilliantly executed, fun, magical and at the same time real. Great filmmaking that everyone can enjoy, not just black people. This is how a movie can tear down barriers. Made me think of how much the world needs peace, how we need to get rid of weapons and make it possible for every human being to travel and see the beauty of the places that are out of reach for many of us."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2021,7/10,"Not too amazing not too bad either, very lukewarm movie that has you spend an enjoyable but not particularly marvelous moment.The cast is interesting especially the female actors who really delivered. The hero is bland but wears the costume well. The antagonists however were truly disappointing and looked cartoonishly evil which ruined the tension.The plot was predictable and a bit of a let down. Also it really was borderline political and worrying. I did not think the ""let's colonize the colonizers"" was some unpolished controversial movie plotline. But the dynamics between the two cousins with different fates because of their fathers' ideal was powerful but not nearly enough explored.The lines were rather Marvel-like as usual with terrible one line jokes or bland conversations.The special effects were amazing as usual although I don't know if the cast ever left the green screened studio.The soundtrack redeemed the movie along with the costume and the art direction which really amazed me and transported me effectively to another world which is why I heavily disagree with a lot of reviews stating this film was unoriginal. The plot was indeed formulaic but the settings and stylistic choices made it very unique in the marvel franchise.Overall if you ignore the predictability of the plot and the contentious goal of the main antagonist and the contemptuous attitude towards the *stupid white people* it is an enjoyable film that for once takes itself seriously which is refreshing compared to late Marvel movies.Also we need to remember it's just a Marvel blockbuster."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,8/10,"To be honest and I know it's not a popular opinion, but recent Marvel movies really started to bore and annoy me with their overuse of cheap slap stick humour and degreasing character development (GotG Vol.2, Thor:Ragnar√∂k). Black Panther surprised me not only with great new visuals but also amazing and interesting characters right there where the last movies just failed. Basic but solid story and great execution. I am glad I watched it in the theatres!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"I¬¥m so happy that a super hero movie actually features heros with african descent. Pround and strong warriors who are standing there ground. It is very good to see Africans beeing more than slaves, criminals or what ever the white men prejudices about Afrcians are.The movie it self is fun to watch. Entertaining story and cgi, very good actors and good story telling."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,5/10,"Decent acting, gorgeous costumes, gorgeous landscapes. The story is average and predictable. It is a good action movie but not the best Marvel movie. I deserves an Oscar for costumes but that's it. The Oscar nomination for best picture is a joke. Slumdog Millionaire that received an Oscar for political reasons was a far better movie than this one. I am a Marvel fan but this movie is much overrated by critics."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,8/10,"Marvel has finally hit a home run with The Black panther. Ryan Coogler has done a fantastic job of adapting the comic book into something that anyone- even those unaware of the titular character- will enjoy. Chadwick Boseman excels as T'challa, ably supported by a great cast. Black panther is funny, tragic and a great addition to the Marvel cannon."

BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2018,1/10,"I actually fell asleep a couple times while trying to get through this film, so maybe I missed the best 15 to 30 minutes of movie-making history and don't realize it, but man... what I did see was not at all what I expected.If you really love Marvel movies, check it out, but otherwise, it came off for me as way too much CGI and not enough substance. This wasn't like Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Thor: Ragnarok, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy or even Doctor Strange where you can go and have a good laugh with some well-written characters and ride along for the action. This requires you to be pretty invested in a lot of background noise with pretty lackluster explanations, cardboard characters and no real payoff. I was expecting something epic to happen and it pretty much came down to the Gungan battle in The Phantom Menace. Entirely unimpressed."
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,5/10,It was well made but little boring and too political. Liberal hollywood should leave the politics to others.
BLACK PANTHER,17 June 2019,4/10,"And thats what this film is.Yes its great that the main actors are black (although as its set in central Africa what else would they be???).
But in reality it s a very average film. There is nothing particularly oustanding about the movie. The set design is very good (in particular the ""techno-organic"" archirecture of Wakanda.) But the storyline is very average - and even sub-standard in places.
The battle scenes in particular are somewhat absurd and unbelieveable - looking more like a mass brawl than any military operation. I suspect whoever wrote it knows very little about armed conflict or military history.
Also the the villains are very disappointing. Klaw is probably the best bad guy the MCU has come up with. However, he is dispensed with early on to make way fort just another baddie clone of the hero. Same as happened in Ant-Man, Thor, Winter Soldier, Iron Man... in fact just about every other Marvel film. A major opportunity lost.
Anyway... it's okay - just. But just that and nothing more."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,9/10,"First off, as a superhero movie, an action movie, a mass entertainment, it works like gangbusters. It is fun, never feels boring, is consistently surprising and inventive in its action sequences and introduces a lot of really cool stuff throughout the movie. But the reason that this movie is going to be so important, why it has become a cultural milestone before it ever was released is where this movie really shines. Ryan Coogler could have been buried under the weight of the expectations of making the first true big-budget superhero movie lead by an almost all black cast, but instead he made a movie that embraces and subverts those expectations and he has delivered an absolute triumph that celebrates the fact that it is an African movie, set 95% in Africa, with 99% African characters. It embraces the traditions, the culture, it does not apologize for its blackness because it is organic to who the characters are. The female characters in this movie are equals to the male characters in combat or even often superior, superior in intelligence, funny, independent and just alive in a way that most movies, but especially superhero movies, rarely allow them to be. And the villain, wow, Killmonger is a true villain, but he is one of the greats because his motivations are understandable, his motivations even make sense, but his solution to a real problem is where he is wrong. The final scene between Black Panther and Killmonger is brilliant, truly. This is clearly just the beginning for these characters, as all of Wakanda looks to play a major part in Infinity War and I for one can barely wait to see it, but in the meantime I plan to return to Wakanda at least once more."
BLACK PANTHER,8 July 2019,7/10,"I enjoyed this, would watch again. I hate 99% of superhero movies; but this was really good. Look forward to next installment."
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,,His speech at Howard still inspires me. Great movie. Thank you for your work.
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2020,7/10,"Wakanda, a mysterious country located in Africa, has become a highly developed country in science and technology thanks to the vibration of gold from the universe, but they have long been closed to the outside world, always keeping this secret."
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2021,7/10,"My girlfriend suggested this because I'm a massive DC fan and not a big fan of Marvel, but in the past couple of weeks, we've watched Deadpool, Deadpool 2 and now The Black Panther. Good gripping storyline and excellent casting.RIP Chadwick Boseman!"
BLACK PANTHER,6 October 2020,7/10,When I watched this film I couldn't find anything wrong with it aside from a few gloopy graphics this film is brilliant and exotic.rip Chadwick Boseman
BLACK PANTHER,6 October 2020,9/10,"Black Panther was the best since it came out and we watch it every so often just for the visuals and vibe. I love that they had Oakland as the backdrop also, I felt the deep connection to the storyline and message. The King may Perish, but the Kingdom is eternal. Wakanda forever!!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,3/10,This movie was ruined for me by the hard to understand accents which then went on to make the acting club fisted and woody. I honestly dont know why people said this was a good movie - its plot holes and cheese was immense. I fell asleep and had to try to finish watching it three times... it really was that bad. If the Lion King could have easy to understand accents then why not movie. Do they no da wei?
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Her it is, the last MCU movie before the long awaited Infinity War, Black panther is a movie that trys to be more than a surehero film, it has a racial message underline with a shakespearean and lion king backstory.
Probably they shouldn't have killed Ullysses Klaue so easily( great perfomance by Andy Serkis) but Killmonger is a cool bad guy too.
Two things leading to Infinity war, first we have alot of wakandian tech and vibranium to the fight against Thanos and we have Bucky Barnes back who is bound to have a huge part of the film"
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2019,5/10,The movie is just not so good. I didn't like this origin story at all. I didn't quite get the feeling.
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,6/10,Obviously a huge milestone. Looked amazing; shame about ropey script. ***
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,3/10,"Minimal plot, what there is just barely keeps the action together (there really isn't much) 
Didn't see the point of half of what happened in the movie, and honestly the entire film can be entirely removed from the MCU without it affecting anything at all (except the post credit scene) So with that kind of impact - what really was the point?"
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,10/10,"Why are Caucasians so angry with this movie? We have grown up with mostly white superhero's with the same tired story line, glorifying white pride and privilege.

BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Visually, the movie is rich great eye candy. But form the perspective of a story, this is Thor, or any other good vs bad family feud. In the Marvel universe there is nothing new here. While I am happy to see an attempt at diversity, Calling this character the 'Black Panther' and staging the story the way they did, felt like pandering. As with many superheros, you have to consider the context of the time period in which they are created. Black Panther was created in 1966 at the height of the US Civil Rights movement. There are several areas that do not make sense. For example, if Vibranium (really?) were that powerful, then why wouldn't Wakonda be a leading world power? Why would it hide its superiority? That makes no sense.Bottom line is this is just more Marvel eye candy that has no depth."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,9/10,"After two comedy-heavy entries in its cinematic universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"", Marvel has finally come back to its senses with ""Black Panther"". Under the very capable hands of writer/director Ryan Coogler (who breathed life back into the Rocky franchise with ""Creed""), along with an all-star African-American cast, ""Black Panther"" brings a fresh approach to the comic book/superhero genre. 
Chadwick Boseman returns as newly-appointed King T'Challa after his breakout role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". He is joined by Danai Gurira (""The Waking Dead"") as his army general, Okoye; Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years A Slave"") his ex-girlfriend and wanted spy; Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out"") his close friend and Okoye's lover; as well as scene-steeling newcomer Letitia Wright as his tech-savvy sister, Shuri. Add in Forrest Whittaker (""Rogue One"") Angela Bassett (""9-1-1""), Michael B. Jordan (""Creed""), Sterling K. Brown (""This Is Us""), Andy Serkis (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit"" trilogy) and you have enough star power to energize a major city. But star power alone is not what carries this movie. It is the well-balanced story and grounded tone that makes it feel more like a Bond movie with hints of ""The Lion King"" and ""Game of Thrones"". 
What impressed me the most is the cultural relevance throughout the movie. The action scenes are good (although I prefer the action sequences in the Russo Brothers' ""Captain America"" films), the tech/gadgets are cool, and the humor is nicely placed to keep it light. But best moments are in Wakanda, where the African scenery, fashion, and culture are on full display. 
Kudos to Marvel for placing ""Black Panther"" into the right hands and kudos to the actors who felt the weight of each role and delivered on all counts. 
The only things that could have been improved were the action scenes (primarily hand to hand combat scenes), some sketchy CGI moments, and a rather sluggish first act. But none of those minor criticisms should deter you from seeing and enjoying this next chapter in the Marvel saga. Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,4/10,"For a while now, Marvel seems to be getting a lot of praise for mediocre movies; Thor Ragnarok, Spider-Man Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy etcThis seems to continue.Essentially, it's the Lion King. Main character is overthrown by a relative who then proceeds to take the throne and make everyone believe the hero is dead, only for the hero and a small band of companions to return and fight off the villain and retake the throne.There is little creativity here in terms of storytelling; the villain is probably the best thing about this movie, even if his fate is as predictable as the majority of Marvel villains. There are few if any reasons to care for the characters. There are no stakes at all, and the plot is pretty predictable. Of all the plots to tell, you go with telling one similar to the Lion King. Well done, Marvel, well done."
BLACK PANTHER,12 August 2021,7/10,Just meh. Nothing special just an ever age superhero movie which for some reason people praise way too much. No idea why.
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2019,5/10,"Started out very promising, but I quickly found myself fast fowarding through several parts! I watched it once, that is more than enough."
BLACK PANTHER,28 November 2020,10/10,"Too many bigoted people failed to look at the overall movie. It followed Joseph Campbell Hero journey, excellent cinematography, and a great musical score. The 'Villain' was relatable and the hero changed through growth. Instead of trying to compare it to Lion King the story is more like a Shakespearean play."
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2019,6/10,"Black Panther was a movie that I didn't really care to see. Sure, there was a LOT of hype for it, but in the long run, it just seemed to me like it would be another Marvel film. Now, after seeing it, it's safe to say I'm glad I wasn't that hyped.The Pros:
Excellent ActingA good car chase sequenceA good scoreA villain that has an actual meaningful goalA decent storyThe Cons:
Little to no action or fighting. All the action is ruined with a shaky camera that shakes so much you can't tell what's happeningPoor CGI. Some scenes look like they were ripped straight from a video gameAn underwhelming final fight sceneThe comedic bits don't land (Especially the awful vine reference)Wasted potentialVerdict: Black Panther isn't as good as everyone is making it out to be. It's a decent film, but it's not a masterpiece. I would only recommend it for huge marvel fans or people who want to see a movie that connects to Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,8/10,"""Black Panther"" is a movie that i was really anticipating. I had waited for this film since i saw for the first time ""Captain America: Civil War"" two years ago. When that movie came out everyone was talking about the great things in ""Civil War"", and one of those great things about that film was Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther. I was incredible in that role and he kept me invested in his character. But i had this question inside my head: Will he hold up for an entire film by himself? - And two years later i have an answer for that question, and the answer is yes.This movie is about T'Challa AKA Black Panther and he is about to become the king of his nation, Wakanda. And while this is happening a group of villains involving Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are doing evil stuff and T'Challa has to stop them. This is the only thing that i going to say about the plot of this movie, because this movie is worth seeing.This film was everything i wanted to see in a ""Black Panther"" movie and more. I like the fact that this movie is not just another super-hero movie, is actually a movie about a person becoming the king of a nation and the difficult task that he has to do. The film took the enough time to set up very well Wakanda, Wakanda's culture, and the importance of becoming a king. And that feeling that this film has, it makes you care more about the characters. You care about them when they are in danger, and there are a lot of moments were you wonder if they could actually succeed in what they are doing. This movie puts in your mind the question: Will this character survive? - Is really T'Challa the best king for Wakanda right now?Talking about T'Challa, Chadwick Boseman once again killed it as Black Panther. He was a very cool hero, but he wasn't just a cool hero, he was actually a person that you can relate to. The writing for him was so good and that combined with Boseman's performance, makes Black Panther a really great hero. The cast of this film is excellent, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, everyone is fantastic. I didn't mentioned this actor because i wanted to talk about him separately from the other ones, Michael B. Jordan. He was so good in this movie, he is a great villain and his motivation is so clear, that he might be the best Marvel villain since Loki, i'm serious.This movie is being directed by Ryan Coogler, who in the past has made incredible films like ""Creed"", proves himself here that he is one the best young directors working today. There are a lot of shots and long takes at Wakanda, and is magnificent to see.That leads to my negatives with the film, Ryan Coogler directed this movie incredibly, but i think that he has to learn how to film action sequences better. The action sequences in this film are fine, there are really great action sequences in this movie, but there are action sequences like the first one at the beginning of the movie, that are kind of bad. That first action sequence is edited very quickly and is very dark and you can barely see it, which kind of annoy me. Another issue that i have with the film is this. The visual effects in this film, for the majority of it, are very good, but there are some scenes were you can really notice the use of green or blue screen behind the actors. And that took me out of the movie in a couple scenes.""Black Panther"" was a very entertaining film, Marvel has made another great super hero movie. It has great action, great characters, excellent villains, it show us a new side of the MCU. The origins of Wakanda and the Black Panther mantle is explained very well so everyone can understand it. If you are a great Black Panther fan, or just a big fan of comic book movies, this movie is absolutely recommendable for you. It has a couple issues with the way the action is filmed and some CGI background that looked fake, but for the most part this movie was very entertaining and i want to see it again. ""Black Panther"" deserves an 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,27 July 2018,1/10,"My first clickbait on Amazon: IMDb just fooled me by setting 7/10. In reality it is 2/10 at it's best. It is so horribly bad that Steven Segal looks like a fantastic movie star. Better watch Dolph Lundgren's movies instead of this.I am sorry, but this is way too much bad to continue comment on this. :-("
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,For soundtracks 9.8/10 for movie 1/10 sorry guys nut it didn't match my expectations
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2019,9/10,"Black Panther a mega hitWow...simply stunning! This was a bolt out of the blue and an exciting one at that! This is the exact beauty of a superhero movie! Mixed with an all start cast of brilliant actors and actresses...this was a hit from he moment it started!Human emotion, a little fantasy and Andy Serkis... what more could you ask for?!...nothing is the answer, but they gave us more none the less! An emotional family storyline wrapped up in historical and tribal traditions, amongst modern technological innovations and Martin Freeman...all this in one huge explosive ball of a movie that had everything...Let's start with the Vibranium...do we all want this...Yes! A metal that can virtually do anything, including the make of the coolest suit of all marvel heroes so far (along with Iron Man). Let's move on to the sheer 'cool' factor of this film! So much 'cool' in this film, that is had led to me introducing a hand shake to my good friend Mazza #WakandaforeverViewers embark on an emotional rollercoaster throughout doing a loop the loop by the second, and not once does it go to far! The ending is how a superhero movie should end! No B.S, just pure and simple! And that sums this film up...pure and simple with a magical element of beauty and street wise actors...this movie is along side the best that Marvel have produced... Wakanda forever
J Boss Review gives 9/10"
BLACK PANTHER,10 August 2020,7/10,"In pursuit of maximizing the audience base, the film makes the story, characters and themes popular. The plot is stingy, but what's interesting is the strange visual impact of African aesthetics mixed with high-tech. Knowledge is power."
BLACK PANTHER,7 November 2021,7/10,"Black Panther is a really good film that tries to deviate from the usual tropes but fails nevertheless. The themes are engaging, the cinematics flawless and the cast superb. It has everything to be a game-changing story, with one of the best antagonists the MCU franchise has ever shown, but throws it all away at the last moment leaving the viewer with the feeling of having watched nothing new."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,5/10,"Its slow, preachy. No big action sequences, including climax. No LOL moments, may be 1 or 2 chuckles. Except for Andy Serkis, rest of the actors are boring. Bottom line, not your typical Marvel movie"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I won't write much, but all what I can say is that it's one of the best Marvel productions. It differs from the cliche ""hero stories"" to a more wide meaningful message. Don't listen to those bad reviews and go watch it yourself, you won't regret it !Enjoy the movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2019,5/10,Beautiful CGI most of the time with a few weak edits early on that sort ruin one's willing suspension of disbelief. And the screenplay breaks the movie into two simple stories that leave the viewer disengaged. The weakest film in the Marvel Mega Serial.
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,10/10,"One of the best origin movie of MCU. The movie delivers good story, great performers, stunning VFX, CGI, Soundtracks etc. Marvel chosen the right director for the movie. Ryan Coogler makes the movie perfect in every way. In first half little drag on the movie but its fine in every way. Overall the movie is fantastic.Chadwick Boseman (The black panther) is terrific. He again stole the movie after the Captain America Civil War. Other actors include Micheal B Jordan, Lupita Nyong, Danai Gurira, Latitia Wright etc do their part very well and much appreciative. The Cinematography , Special effects are really amazing. The action sequences in Busan and the climax fight scenes with Erik Killmonger are perfectly made and the visuals are so good.Another plus point of the movie is soundtrack which makes the movie more and more perfect. Ludwig Goransson soundtrack much apprectiative and very apt for the movie. Other thing is culture and life of Africans. I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. I forgot Kendrick Lamar's end song, visuals, font etc... it is fantastic.Overall best movie of marvel. Don't believe the hateful reviews it's a good entertainment for all. Go and watch it on theatres..."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,8/10,"I don't really like to write reviews, cause watching movies is a personal experience and every person may have different opinion. But I really don't like when people just give rating 1 to a movie that's good. It's not the best one in the MCU, but it's definitely something new. 
In my opinion, only one first movie in the MCU, for one particular character, that was really awesome, was the Iron Man. But if we compare Black Panther with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange... it was completely the same, just an introduction to a character. I didn't compare it with the Guardians of the Galaxy cause Guardians are just different kind of story. They didn't bother to introduce you too much with the backgrounds of Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Groot and Rocket, they just mentioned it through the movie. 
Black Panther just introduced you with Wakanda, main characters, history, vibranium, technological advancement, tradition ... and it's just a beginning."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,4/10,"This is okay as an action flick, but it is a really bad political statement. Wakanda is essentialy a city state living in welfare chauvinism, locking away their space grade technology to only benefit a select few. This is all the while Africa lives in the mud, and they basicaly don't care about the rest of the world. It is in fact a movie where the supposed good guys (Black Panther and co.) are in fact authocratic money hoarders, and the supposed bad guys who want to share this endless wealth are the good guys - but even they would restrict it to ""people of african descent"" because they are black nazis, or to their buddies to do ""secret ops"". No one talks about sharing their tech with the whole world based on merit to make the world a better place with it. Stopping african and world hunger and draught? Stopping war? Stopping energy hunger? Stopping climate change? Taking Earth to the space age? Colonizing the galaxy ? Wakanda doesn't care! They just don't want to share! The funniest part is that this is a movie that is supposed to ""empower"" black people... by basically making them look like Republicans in contemporary US! Biggest joke ever. Don't you know? There's no climate change!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"Seen today and i realy enjoyed the movie.I dont know how the story comic and movie compare each other, so story may not be special but as stand alone among all the Marvel and comic adaptation, Black Panther has an fantastic cast, fantastic mix of culture and high tech.andDanai Gurira as Okoye What for a wonderful and sexy guard."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,1/10,"I really thought this one would be better than Ant Man. It's a close race to the bottom of my list for those two movies.Visuals are pretty good
Story is ...mehOkay, time to get hyped for the next Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,8 June 2018,1/10,"This movie is boringly predictable. The CGI was mostly passable, but there are some scenes where it's really, really bad. I tend to get caught up in a movie and can overlook a few mistakes, but even I couldn't help noticing how bad it was in several places in the movie. I'm glad I saved this one for a Red Box rental."
BLACK PANTHER,12 February 2019,8/10,"I really wish that I had liked more Black Panther and to be sincere I can't yet put my finger where it lost me, but I guess it was in the script. But if the movie fails to impress me Chadwick Boseman performance amazed me, it was nothing less than incredible, the role of a wise leader in a divided world fits him even better than his panther suit."
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2019,9/10,With one exception. Michael B. Jordan's character was really annoying and his acting should have been dialed back a bit... seemed to try to hard
BLACK PANTHER,1 February 2021,10/10,"This is what movies are all about. The cast is awesome, the production design is amazing. The story had me from start to finish the first time I saw it. There was so much to see. Chadwick Bozeman was the perfect king and we are lucky to have his work. This is a comic superhero movie. Not supposed to be a deep character study. I don't understand the low reviews on this platform are all about. The box office and critical reviews speak for themselves."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,3/10,"Very little awesome action, Very very, Little connection between characters, very, very very, little humour, and V....no surprises at all. I didn't walk out, but it was close."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2019,1/10,"Why would any American audience care about any 'royal linage' form of government? Did we not fight and win two wars to throw off any hints of foreign royal influence? Can Americans relate to the top leader of a country being determined by single combat to the death?At nearly ever turn there is anti European ancestry statements and references. Anti-White stereotypes and outright racism are prevalent. There are so many references to violence against non-Blacks and current world governments, a person would think the title 'Black Panther' refers to the 'American Black Panther Party'.Lastly, the CGI is clumsy at best."
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2018,6/10,"To be honest, i am not the biggest fan of any of the marvel movies. Most them have weak plots, lots of cgi and 2 years later i can't remember them.
This film is no different to the rest. It is neither overly bad or good.@ People crying about it being over hyped etc. EVERY movie is over hyped. If you havn't learned that by now then you have some serious misgivings.Black panther turned out to be exactly what i thought it would be. Nothing more, nothing less. It has plenty of decent action, a couple of scenes in which you think to yourself ""really?""But all in all rating it 1 star says more about you than this film. Can people PLEASE start making their reviews AFTER thinking first. Don't let the over hype anger you and then rate it 1 star. It is both unfair and and unintelligent way to review.All you see these days in IMDB is 10/10 and 1/10 with very few others in between, unless the movie has an adult audience. Maybe IMDB needs both an IQ and age test before allowing people to post.All in all if you even slightly enjoyed the other marvel movies, you will enjoy this. 
It is the same old same old.6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2018,6/10,"I was going to type ""I have no idea why this movie is smashing the box office"", but then, I do know.I get it that liberals (especially racial minority liberals) would think of this film as some sort of equality milestone, and conservatives would think of this film as political correctness agenda. But really? Just this was enough to get you 1B+ in box office? Wonder woman was 10x better as a movie. Maybe they were right in 2016. America IS more sexist than racist.Anyway, the movie itself was very bland. The plot made zero sense. I know the Avengers universe was supposed to be very fiction, but still, this was stretching it. A small country in the middle of Africa being sooooo advanced? And if it's so advanced, why do people still wear those half naked clothes and fight so primitively? Why is their election still so savage? Whoever wins a fist fight... Geez. And why would a kid raised in America for his entire life, who went to MIT and everything, have no ambition other than to go back to this African country and be some stupid king? And really? You grew up in Oakland. I thought this would be one of the less oppressed places for POC. He recites the history textbooks like he lived 300 years to see all the slavery. I mean at least write some plot that makes sense.The characters were very one dimensional as well. Black Panther himself was super boring. Nobody had any personality. Killmonger was a complete douche. I mean I thought in recent years Marvel made sure to write characters with life stories and end games that made sense. Killmonger was like one of those 60's Disney villains that just wanted to burn the world. In the end, everything's predictable, and you're just waiting for the movie to end.I'm a die hard liberal. I'm happy that a black hero movie broke records. But I wish that it was from a film that deserved it."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2019,2/10,"Seems that some producer requested something black and this is what they came about! Horrible movie, very difficult to understand the dialogues because it was decided to use an accent. Why accent? Or use some African language and stick subtitles or go totally in English. I've spent 40 minutes trying to get some plot, some story, that's when I realised that only them the movie was starting... and what a joke it is. If I were an African descendent I would be offended for using this rubbish to praise the Color. Another joke is Hollywood put this in the list of the best. Disgraceful."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2019,9/10,"Black PantherDir: Ryan CooglerOf course this will be biased...why wouldn't it be üòÅ given being Black Panther's origin film into the MCU was fantastically told. I know that his background and family tree can get messy because of how extensive it is. Started the film with a flashback speeds forward into present day to tell what the flashback means. Was told really well because at first you can be confused on who is who in the flashback. The flow of the story wasn't out of wack were you could be lost as times surprisingly so everything fit together perfectly. The CGI was amazing seeing how they obviously had to depend a lot on it, the golden jaguar and black Panther suits were done soooo well and really give you an insight of what Wakanda really is. With every MCU superhero film I've noticed that they always have a ""hero"" moment or value that they tie into the film. It's a moment that the hero can prove why they are a hero. Black Panther managed to carry this moment out very very well. Like I said I'm obviously biased but per usual Marvel Studios can do no wrong. BTW there are two post credit scenes. First one after the first credits and the second after the full credits. Got to nerd out with the people around me for a min in between credits.

BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2019,9/10,"I was already a big fan of Chadwick's take on the Black Panther in Civil War, and after seeing the trailer, it was clear that this movie embraced it's African root's to the fullest, which is a side we so rarely see that that alone was enough to make me want to see it. I was not disappointed; I was impressed beyond belief: This is by far the most mature and relevant movie Marvel has ever made.Acting:
Chadwick Boseman returns as T'Challa in a subtle yet very impressive performance, delivering a wide range and intensity and realism all at once. Not oscar-worthy, but if he were nominated, I wouldn't have protested.Michael B Jordan gives us the best MCU villain yet, with an emotional and relatable background, in a strong performance(not without it occasionally being too over the top)It is clear that he worked hard on this character, and his character is in a way the soul of this movie.Lupita Nyong'O as Nakiya is a role you wouldn't expect to like as much as you should. Her character is mainly the love interest, but her morals and wisdom and skillset, supported by Lupita's subtle performance make her a very likable character.Letitia Wright as Shuri is absolute gold(or vibranium?). She and Chadwick have a hilarious and believable chemistry as brother and sisters, and her big ammunition cache of sass and big brains make her a great asset to an already great cast.Winston Duke as M'Baku is another big surprise: his powerful performance as the tribal leader of the Jabari is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in a long time, and Winston provides both humor and sheer intimidation with excellence.Sterling K Brown as N'Jobu is excellent, giving a very realistic and raw performance as a broken and conflicted prince, and might be one of the best actors in this movie.Andy Serkis seems to have a blast in his role as Klaue, but to me he is having a bit too much fun. It very soon becomes over the top, and although he is ruthless and occasionally funny, he can feel like a bit of a sore thumb.Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira are both great supporting characters as W'Kabi and Okoye, and although their character arc is a great watch, it could have been explored better than we get to see in the theatrical cut. Both deliver subtleness and intensity at a great balance.Martin Freeman and Forest Whitaker play their part and do that well most of the time, but you can't help but notice that Martin could be written much more layered and interesting than what he is given to work with here. I like him more as a Hobbit.Direction:
Ryan Coogler deeply impressed me with Creed, and it is great to see that something vastly different like a big comicbook-movie fits him just as well. He directs great action sequences and emotional moments, and truly transcends all the directors that have come before him.Cinematography:
While Marvel is known for their pretty bland use of camera, this is clearly the best shot movie thus far. Tracking shots, creative spins and wide establishing shots are put to great use here, though the use of color could still be perfected.Plot:
After a great introduction, the pacing suffers a bit in a section through Korea, but improves again vastly back in Wakanda. This is a really smart movie, partially presented through it's relevant themes like colonialism and slavery, and political isolationism. The cast translates these themes perfectly through grounded yet effective dialogue, and good use of flashbacks and creative exposition early on.Editing:
Nothing much to note here, standard MCU cutting of story. A lot of good deleted scenes were left out, which is a bit of a shame.Music:
Ludwig G√∂ransson won the Oscar for this score, and he absolutely deserves it. I rarely come across a soundtrack that is as rousing and involving in every track it has as this one. Ludwig involved traditional African instruments, combined with standard orchestral sounds and modern electronics to create a unique and wonderful blend of superhero music, which is the best from Marvel yet.Costume Design and Make-up:
Oscars were also won for these, again well deserved. The traditional African garbs and face/body-paint are wonderful to look at and give a deep sense of culture and history to Wakanda.CGI:
A point that many people complained about. While I agree that this is far from the best CGI that Marvel has to offer, I think it is a lot of way too harsh judgment. A lot is still very impressive, particulary the vibranium mine and the Korea chase.Tone:
The standard humoristic tone of the MCU is everpresent, but slightly better thanks to Coogler's writing, with Shuri and M'Baku delivering a lot of well-working levity in surprisingly somber scenes. The dramatic scenes themselves are some of the most powerful in all of MCU history, and there is a high chance of tear-shedding in some of them.Overall Concensus:
Thank's to Ryan Coogler's creative hand, the faith of Marvel Studios and a fantastic cast, Black Panther succeeds in its goals and beyond, delivering the best superhero movie I have ever seen. 8.8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"Two thousand years ago a magician named Dedi performed a trick whereby he cut off a goose's head and reattached it.Years later David Blaine performed the same magic and wowed audience. See, when I first dabbled in magic, I hated the mantra that ""it's not what you show, but how you show"".But as I matured, I understood. Same thing applies to this movie. See, anything and everything that can be done under the sun has been done to death. 99% of the crappy movies Hollywood produce are rehashes. What idiots bashing this film doesn't get is that it is NOT about the plot. It's about artistic showcase.The first five seconds is alone worth the entrance fee. It's creative, edge, sci-fy and draws on from different flavors of movies. Deadpool-esque action? Check. James Bond meets Iron Man? Check. A bit of Oakland, California street flavor? Check. This movie's originality lies in the nuances. Every frame had something to offer. And it moved at rapid pace. No repeats. Every frame tells a story and ushers in next scene triggering Chekov's gun.For instance, the majestic and stellar costume is alone worth hours and hours of scrutiny and dissection. Then the custom font. The locket designs. Etcetera etcetera.It's like a fractal. The more you analyze the more it unfolds.My favorite of course was Queen's stunning and majestic white dress. The train scenes. The challenge... Heck the entire movie!In a slightly jovial note, a testament to a film's strength is how long you can stave off peeing. Haha!! I really needed to go bad at the first ten minutes but I had such a morbid FOMO that I managed to stave it off for 1 whole hour and couldn't take it any longer. It even made me wonder if I should give it 9 stars since it ruined my experience by being TOO GOOD!!!It's like a gift that kept on giving. Layers and layers of never ending down the rabbit hole to an Oz land. It highlighted pride and power of Africa. No scenes were duplicates. Even the ""challenges"" that were duplicated were different in same context.It's pure artistic genius. Little things like an African saying flawless Chinese, the spear scenes, the Amazon Alexa type of futurstic hologram, the smattering of history lessons on African masks, the ""Baby don't hurt me.."", turning the table of Africa on America, ""knives are so primitive"" line, ""colonizer"" swanky diss, the unbelievable intro without making any splash, brouhaha or stupid Mission Impossiblesque mindless explosion, but rather a nonchalant, subdued and subtle African theme of sounds instead of score and splicing shots in supernatural fashion....jusqua right dosage really hit the spot for me.I never read a single page of comic book for this character but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is solid. The jokes are funny. The originality lies in showing the same things that were done to death by Hollywood in a new light with all the colors, aura and halation of African culture, pride and majestic beauty.This movie is not about the plot. It's about artistic showcase. Can't believe so many spate of negative reviewers putting salty comments. Makes you wonder about credibility and leitmotif.I went to Downtown Disney with primarily white audience who took their kids and they gave a scattered applause at the end.Then again white people are hard to please anyways. Especially the college read academic ones."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,Why was this so bad? The action looks fake and doesn't flow! The acting is bad and script is boring. Worst superhero movie out there!!
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,,"Just like we were introduced to Asgard in the Thor trilogy (although it was more fun in the the third movie), Black Panther introduces us to Wakanda, a place/Kingdom, hidden from the outside world in the continent of Africa.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik ""Killimonger"" (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...
My rating: 4/5"
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,5/10,"I'm not gonna waste any of your time so let me just say that this movie had the potential to be a great marvel movie, but falls flat with weird story pacing, wooden acting, Marvel's humor (which is cringe humor) and 90s CGI. It was simply boring. I really had great expectations seeing the trailer but the movie itself is the worse marvel movie to date."
BLACK PANTHER,21 June 2020,8/10,Some deep themes I resonated and some great ones for world unity and the African cause. Felt like it remained genuine in its attempt to respect African cultures and had some amazing scenery and great special effects.
BLACK PANTHER,21 June 2018,7/10,"This movie is good, chadwick did his best in this movie. action was great , CGI is awesome. Mainly highly appreciation from this movie is, showing the african's culture,their passion, their way of life. Also we got some best character from it like SURI. 
But to me, storyline is bit disappointing. A villain came to wakanda, claimed his throne & also got it by trail combat. Its kinda like, cap america can also be a King if he can beat panther. ( & i think, cap can beat panther) with storyline, the movie great. i enjoyed it :)"
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,10/10,"Let's face it, the MCU is a very very successfull film franchise. For ten years, the have been cranking out movie to movie and each one is usually either great or very good and has made either a lot or a decent amount of money at the box office. But Black Panther: is something completely different. And it is a good type of different. For starters, the story is great: It blends together an amazing tale of both revenge, wonder, and a man struggling to do what is right. The story of Black Panther is also able to explore a more important idea than other superhero movies as well and also is able to explore lots of different complex but smaller ideas, like ""how can a good man be a great ruler but also be a murderer"" and ""why does a country that can solve all of the world's problems keep itself hidden from the world?"" The story is also able to explore lots of social issues (mostly race- related) and has an amazing twist that keeps the entire movie going and keeps it from getting boring. Chadwick Boseman does an amazing job of portraying the main character of T'Challa/Black Panther, he makes the character both diverse/witty/cool/serious/realistic all at the same time. Michael B. Jordan also does an equally-amazing job of portraying the movie's main villain-Erik Killmonger. He is both tough and soft, has a great backstory, and is very intimidating without having any superpowers. And at some points in the story, you will probably find yourself rooting for him as well. The supporting actors and actresses also do a great job too: Lupita Nyong'o portrays the character of Nakia with excellence giving her character a badass aura that needs to be seen on more female characters in popular film franchises. Danai Gurira does the exact same thing for her character of Okoye, and in turn she becomes a more deadly more fiercer female type of stormtrooper that could actually kill Luke Skywalker before he kills her. Letitia Wright gets first prize as funniest character though, in her breakout performance as Shuri: T'Challa's smart and witty inventor sister. And Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis all do great jobs acting as W'Kabi, M'Baku, N'Jobu, Ramona, Zuri, and Ulysses Klaue. The only problem with the acting is Martin Freeman. What is he doing here? And why is he playing a lead character? It is just a little random, that's all. The action sequences are also amazing and expertly-executed. They look a lot like the action sequences in The Matrix with all of the slo-mo and detail. The movie's soundtrack is great as well. It combines both traditional African folk music, modern hip-hop and R&B, classical orchestra, and breezy pop. Ryan Coogler does a great job of directing the movie and, of course, the special effects and fast humor are top-notch. As well as the character development. And sure, Black Panther has its occasional problems (such as a constantly-occurring plot point and a sort of lacking final showdown between Panther and Killmonger). But all of the problems are really small and in the end, we are left with an amazing masterpiece of a blockbuster that will most likely transcend generations."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,5/10,"Ever since i saw Captain America: Civil War, i was instantly invested in the character Black Panther. Immedietly after the movie i went home and looked into everything about this character, his backstory, comic lore, etc. And i was so excited that he was getting his own solo movie. But i saw it, and i hate to say this but i was extremely disappointed.Well this movie is not completely bad, first off all of the characters did an excellent job and when they have an emotional moment, you totally buy it. Even though i am probably the last person to say this, Killmonger is one of the best MCU Villains. I totally agree with what this guy is doing even though his methods of doing so were a little cruel. Also the music was very good. It gave the movie a sense of tone and even gave a little in depth view of other world cultures. Also the action sequences are pretty fun (for the most part). And sadly that's all i have for positives, i just wish i could've put more here.My biggest complaint of this movie by far was the pacing. The first 30 minutes of the film were a huge drag. Then things start to pick up, then the entire movie feels rushed from there. Also the film's CGI was bad in parts. For example that entire battle sequince at the end looked like graphics you see in a PS2 game. I understand CGI can be a good tool when there are difficult things to add into a movie (I mean armored rhinos isent something you can add in a movie perfectly), but i mean this movie's budget is way to high for the CGI to look like that. Other films old and new have done better with smaller budgets. Near the middle of the movie i told myself that ""It's gonna be a slow burn, then the big pay off with make everything right!"" But the movie does not give you the pay off you want. So all in all, Black Panther was a pretty average Marvel Movie. I feel like this movie was rushed in the making. It felt like one of the Producers said ""Oh wait we need Black Panther in Infinity War, but he has no movie! Okay we will make a movie about him in the span of 2 years and he will have been a fully developed character by then."" I do believe this is one of Marvel's weakest films. However i wonder, would i have enjoyed it more if i didn't hype it up?"
BLACK PANTHER,12 October 2018,2/10,"I could not understand a word anyone said. Kind of a drawback when watching a movie.Either lose the fake, thick South African accents or have the decency to give us a subtitled version. Which has happened in the past with Scottish accents."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,7/10,"""Black Panther"" serves as yet another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, showcasing a wildly different world feel and a deeper story than previous entries, while still providing the staples that the devoted fan base enjoys. Many critics and audiences are proclaiming this as the best of the series and even saying that the film is a masterpiece. I feel that is stretch as there are some apparent issues with film's execution of action, effects, and actual focus of the story, regardless of depth. ""Black Panther"" is indeed a good film, but not a ""masterpiece"".The story follows T'Challa aka the Black Panther, sometime after ""Captain America: Civil War"", finally taking the throne of his late father in the advanced hidden capital of Wakanda, an African country pretending to be a typical third world nation. When an old enemy pops up again, the new king finds himself face to face with a mysterious American mercenary with stirring obsession with Wakanda.The story to ""Blank Panther"" is actually really good and goes a step above the usual in the MCU with plenty of emotional depth to its characters and not relying too much on previous films in the series. I will refrain from speaking on it to hold back spoilers. I will say that the story basically becomes the ""Lion King"". Nuff said.Our hero is very likable and never does anything to break his status as a good role model. Chadwick Boseman created a fan favorite with Civil War and those qualities carry over here.The villains are also above par, which for me has always been an issue with Marvel movies: a lot effort for the hero and the villain is just a one note baddy played by a high profile actor. Andy Serkis returns to replay his role of Klaue from ""Age of Ultron"", providing yet another over the top and energetic performance. His character isn't deep, but he knows how to chew the scenery. Yet again, this man proves he should have more roles, even outside motion capture. Then there is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. I won't spoil his character, but needless to say Jordan continues to show why he is one the new greats by providing an entertainingly defiant and yet emotionally involving villain. It's nice to actually have one that was an understandable reason for his behavior.From the beauty of the advanced world of Wakanda to the superb soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, the film provides a great blend of native African culture mixed with a futuristic cyberpunk style. The film is downright beautiful at times, especially during the spiritual ancestorial plain scenes. There is even a hint of James Bond through a scene where T'Challa is given a new suit and gadgets ala every Q scene ever. Boseman's charm helps with that vibe too.As I said, the film is not a masterpiece. First off, while I do like the story over all, I do feel like there is was one story going on and the then another one just sorta starts halfway through. The film is pretty focused on Klaue until the halfway point where in which Killmonger suddenly just takes center stage. I found that little jarring. I guess Klaue was just a means to an end. I also found the fight scenes to be rather meh. The action itself is good with some great set-pieces such as cool chase scene in South Korea. I mainly mean the coverage of the one on one fights. They were just shot too close and cut too quick at times, making it hard to really appreciate the conflict. You just get the idea that people are beating down on each other. This is why I praise movies like ""John Wick"" or ""The Foreigner"" for actually covering visible fight scenes. I also found the final conflict at the end to be disappointing as it was ruined by some pretty meh CGI. It honestly looked like a 3D animated cartoon by the end. The CGI was actually iffy in some other areas too, and this late into the MCU that shouldn't be the case. It sorta looks like ""Gods of Egypt"" at times. (A guilty pleasure by the way) Also, some of the camera work as just headache inducing. One shot in particular where it starts upside down and spins around really just hurt my eyes. I get the idea: ""the situation has been turned upside down so let's literally shoot this in an unnerving way"". Ultimately, it just gave me a headache.Despite these issues, I still think ""Black Panther"" is a solid entry in the Marvel cannon and I am excited to see more of Wakanda in the upcoming ""Infinity War"". I just feel some are making this sound better than it really is. It is really good movie, but not a great one. I feel perhaps it might be some the politics of the film that is raising it up to ""masterpiece"" level. I just don't care about that. I just care about whether it was a good movie or not. ""Black Panther"" was good. Recommended."
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,9/10,"This film is great for the Afro-American actors in Hollywood. With 1.3 billion dollars at the box-office, it's the highest grossing stand alone movie of the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,21 October 2018,9/10,"Black Panther, the highest grossing Marvel movie at the domestic box office, has received so much love and praise from critics and audiences all around the world. Is it worth all the praise? Yes, yes it is! This is an absolutely fun popcorn film with tons and tons of depth.What's the story? After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.Okay, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room first, since I just wanna get it over with: the CGI isn't the best. Although Wakanda looks absolutely beautiful, the opening scene had very well-crafted CGI, and the action is really exciting, there are times where the CGI could look absolutely STUPID, like during the scene where T'Challa and Killmonger were fighting. The people standing up on the mountain was done in such a horrible way it's laughable at how fake it is. Also, near the end where T'Challa and Killmonger were once again fighting but this time with some electric trains, that also looked very laughable and stupid. Okay, with that aside, the best aspect of the film is the story. Not the action, DEFINITELY not the effects, but the story. It's a movie that is aware of other countries, which is a great twist, not just for Marvel, but for movies in general. I know Marvel likes to put their primary focus on the story, which is a smooth move, but in this film it especially works because we need to see the nation of Wakanda and to sympathize what it's going through. It's also kind of like James Bond where they go to different countries, like Nigeria and South Korea. Also, although Wakanda isn't a real country, the movie develops and forms it to make it feel like it's real. They explain the nationality, the quality of life, the looks, and the culture of this fictional nation. It's very cool on how well-setup it is, and I wish more movies could do that. One last thing I'd like to mention is that the acting and characters are very well done, and while it does focus on a male superhero, it gives equal power to the female characters as well, and without them, the Black Panther is pretty much screwed.In conclusion, Black Panther is a diverse and refreshing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that's good for both Marvel fans and movie fans in general. Of course if you like Black Panther and Marvel, you'll love this film. Also, ignore the people who say it's a bad movie, because those people don't know what they're messing with."
BLACK PANTHER,22 December 2018,6/10,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come.
When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. 6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,8/10,"It's now been a while since I actually enjoyed watching a superhero flick at the movie theater. Don't get me wrong, I used to LOVE superhero films, but ever since the formula worked so well (money wise) for the studios, the scripts have unfortunately lost all meaning. Thank God, this is not the case for Black Panther.
Although the film does start somewhat as a low-paced, vfx plastered (specially in the fictitious world of Wakanda), clich√© adventure film, if you can power through the first 10 to 15 minutes or so, you're gonna be in for a treat.
What I loved most about Black Panther is the fact that each and every important character in the story has a well shaped backstory, they all have clear motivations for their actions, and the melodrama of the family relationships works perfectly, because it gives all of the main characters a conflict that is much needed in these types of films, and as we move forward, the plot thickens, and the stakes rise. All in all, a well written film with marvelous performances (even in small roles, as Sterling K. Brown shows us).
The script finishes off with a much needed message that envelops the whole point of the film: ""...in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers."" The relevance of this film shoots up to the sky, when the theme is so intertwined with what's going on in the world right now. And the fact that the screenwriters managed to write in a message like this, in the context and with the studio pressures that come with a blockbuster type of film like this one, is something to stand up and clap about, if you ask me.
I can only hope that the sequel to this film does the first one justice, and I can almost be sure it won't, but oh well... that's Hollywood."
BLACK PANTHER,18 August 2019,8/10,Would recommend this movie.Reviews were not lying.
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2019,10/10,This has to be one of the best marvel film's ever as an introduction film goes this was mind blowing
BLACK PANTHER,3 November 2018,1/10,Very disappointing. It's just a James Bond movie with black actors playing the same patriarchal sterotypes. Lazy. Boring. Terrific actors wasted.
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2021,5/10,"I literally was feeling sleepy just half way through the movie. I might not be a good critic on someone's acting, but the people who acted in this film seemed pretty dull. The characters were very simple and predictable , exceptions only Andy Serkis & Micheal B. Jordan. T'challa's sister was a bit interesting. So she might be an exception too.But other than that, the film felt too dragged."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"IMO about half of Marvel Films are better than this one.What about IronMan, Avengers, Civil War, Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spideman Homecoming..,?My 10yo is a huge Marvel Fan and just after the end the told me it was ok, he liked Ragnarok better and I tend to agree.I think its ok that BP doesn't need any other Avenger characters to appear. But at times I missed Tony Stark, I mean he would kill to have access to Wakanda's technology, and what about Captain America pledging for Buckys fate?The worst thing IMO is that this one doesn't fit at all with other Marvel movies. It may be an average solo film, but nothing else, very much like Wonder Woman.Even with all the action, there's really no sense of danger, its supposedly going worldwide but the threat never leaves wakanda. Its like no one ever knew they were in danger.
Ragnarok went over the top on comedy, but here, its non existant, I think I only giggled with Stan Lee's cameo.
The plot twists a la GoT don't have any impact.
Also the villains were dissapointing. Ulysses Klaue was promising and I expected him to have a bigger part but it ends too soon. Killmonger is just a kid in a tantrum.Heck even the post credit scenes sucked."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2018,2/10,"I try to keep it simple. This is one of the the worst hero movies. Boring with chaotic action parts and outside of action the movie has a pace of a dead horse.There is no action, there is chaos. That a spear is not good choice again a gun knows everybody. To make up for this ""handicap"", the fighting scenes are cut every 2 second resulting in a chaotic mishmash. This is in strong contrast to the rest of the peace less movie.This is and should have remained a purely fictional hero movie, but the attempt to put it into context with painful events in the history of Africa is the biggest laugh to the misery and suffering of its people.The feeling after the movie is clear: disappointment."
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2018,8/10,"While the story may be a little undeveloped, the characters are great, the acting is very good, and the visuals are simply stunning. This movie doesn't at all come across as another typical, generic comic book movie. It's unique. It's different. It's refreshing. It may not be anywhere close to the Dark Knight, but it certainly isn't as bad as most superhero movies I've seen. A little overhyped, but it is far from a dud."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"I rarely give a movie 10/10. This is straight 10 for me, for a number of reasons. 1. There have been no movies that are cast with all African actors and directors, especially in the new marvel universe (I am excluding soul food movies here). There have also been hardly any blockbusters that have African leads, Denzel and Will Smith have tried with Hancock, American Gangster and I am Legend hence these two actors are legends. The acting from actors who don't get the practice of leading, is phenomenal, it was like watching 007, Matrix all in one. It was simply awesome that African actors could change perceptions without overdoing the us and them. 2. The story was authentically African, it embodies our view of the world, in some way often naive but good natutred that can be misconstrued as primitive or stupid. Most European directors often focus on the perceived negatives over these emotions. A mother makes naive choices, ends up a single mum, a son angry at an absent father but somehow lacks the capacity to forgive, the gangster who seems to have a childish view of living despite his obvious reality, the angry black man who takes a gun into a hospital to make his point of inequality. This movie was just the pure fun of living in an all African society. Where people fight, betray and make up without that anglo saxon need to finish what you started. One for the black folks to understand. 3. It highlights the gulf that has existed in the African population between, those who got sold into slavery and those who stayed and often this gulf has meant, affluent westernised Africans care little for those in Africa, hence the continent is poorer, it is a deep division caused by the most divisive point in history amazingly captured by Marvel of all people. The villain some how is not quite a villain a very DC touch in my opinion but very African in origin. 4. Every actor gave 100%, it was personal and in turn this singular film will inspire generations for millennia not because it features Africans but because it sends a positive message of hope to the whole world and embodies the African view of forgiveness, passion and self development, not many people could have emerged out of 400 years of systematic genocide to stand almost equal to any race today. Finally, it has a name ""Wakanda"". In my opinion, it is not a real place but lives in the heart of all Africans. I can understand if the typical expectations were, another Marvel flick and it is now hard to turn tail but this is a seperate franchise, probably the last but an amazing movie, passionate, funny, suspenseful and worth a second watch. Go see it... Please! Critics are just not qualified to critique. It is a movie for Africans and those who want to have fun with a bold Marvel approach to adding Africans to the super hero universe. It was about time, considering we already kick ass in real life."
BLACK PANTHER,4 January 2019,2/10,"Wow- so I finally am attempting to watch this because it is nominated for awards. I at least expected to be entertained, but not halfway through I'm bored to death. The acting, except for the fabulous Ms Bassett, is pretty lame. Just because you do a big film with a mostly black cast, doesn't just give it an automatic herald. I'm very disappointed and expected a whole lot more. Snooze."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Every time a MCU film comes out, critics hail it as ""Marvel's best film yet"" only for me to find it either good/average (Civil War) or complete trash (Thor: Ragnarok). So, when critics were calling Black Panther the best MCU film, thankfully, I didn't put much stock into it because I don't think it's Marvel's ""best""; that title still belongs to Winter Soldier...BUT I freaking loved the movie; it's definitely in my top 5 MCU films (maybe top 3 but I have to see it again before I can make that decision). The good: it showcased an African nation with different tribes, that were technologically advanced, and had their own natural resources that the world has never seen before. That's significant to me because a lot of African nations were stripped of their natural resources centuries ago, so to see this on screen was a breath of fresh air as was seeing African royalty as opposed to the usual impoverished Africans, gangsters, slaves, thugs, drug dealers etc... The performances were amazing...Boseman was great as usual but the stand outs for me were Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye); I'm glad my daughter gets to see 2 strong, intelligent black females on screen. Jordan was a cool villain (a lot better than most of those crappy Marvel villains); I can always appreciate when you can hate a villain's actions but empathize with their motives. The bad: the CGI was rough in a lot of places and some of the action pieces were very muddled. There were a few slow areas, but I often find that happening with origin stories, so I can overlook that. Overall, I really dug this film; for now, I'll give it an 8/10 but that could change upon 2nd viewing. Bravo to Ryan Coogler and his team!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Ryan Coogler has got to be one of the best directors out right now. Not only is his work phenomenal but his movies are cast to perfection. 
I think the phenomenal appeal of this movie, besides the fact that you can take your entire family because it's kid friendly, is that you don't have to be a comic book reader to follow the movie. It is good as a standalone, therefore you can take a date, you can take your parents, you can take your kids or you can take your comic book club.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it for all races and ages."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"Marvel took a huge risk with black panther just before the release of The Infinity Wars. With a complete different tone as compared to other
marvel movies, the risk may not have paid off and it could have affected the frenzy around the final two movies with box office not performing
as expected. But, the movie turned out to be brilliant and Marvel continues to outperform DC on all levels (JL was a disappointment).
I think Marvel's formula for success is to have atleast a decent story line, like the trunk of a tree, rather than going all bang bang with
expensive grpahics. Then characters are introduced and developed just like branches of a tree over time. There are as many as nine diverse characters and
all of them are given sufficient screen time. The setting is similar to background where the tree (analogy) is growing. The set here is Wakanda.
The designers have done a marvellous job with the city, costume, and make up. The soundtracks bring an element of Africa beautifully binding Wakanda
and the characters. The dialogues are decent with tinge of humour and smartass lines.
Black panther (without revealing any spoilers) is a story of a prince who rights the wrong of his father in light of his death. TChaka created
the monster killmonger due to differences in ideology with his cousin. Klaue is another interesting character who smuggles vibranium out of Wakanda
and is responsible for death of Tchaka and other tribe leaders. TChalla is looking to avenge his father's death when he encounters Killmonger and loses
control over Wakanda in a straight duel to the throne with him. With help from Jabari tribe, Nakia, and Shuri; TChalla manages to defeat Killmonger and
brings about few changes for the first time as a ruler of Wakanda.
Now, coming to the ratings of the movie, there are five parameters on which I score movie out of ten. These are story (1), acting (1.5), aesthetics (2),
editing/narrating (1.5), Xfactor/uniqueness/fun (1.3) which totals to 7.3/10. My reccommendation is MUST WATCH.
I like to end my reviews by describing my favourite scene of the movie. Mine is- the car chase scene in which Klaue tries to escape and TChalla 
dismantles vehicles like toys by jumping over them and removing wheels with one hand."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"Black Panther is another great film in the Marvel universe, but I feel is a little out of touch with the Infinity War plot-line.
It has all the right points for an origin story but we are shown nothing new about the personality of the character that we didn't already get from Captain America: Civil War.
I really enjoyed performances from Letitia Wright and Michael B Jordan. And the set up and location of the film was great, they did a really good job of showing us Wakanda.
Definitely not one to miss out if you enjoy the Marvel franchise."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"""Black Panther"" exceeded my expectations. The cast, the scenery, the special effects, the crew, fabulous. I cannot find one thing I did not like about this movie. This is Marvel's best movie to date. I know Black Panther is the star, but my girl ""The General"" was too tough. I hope the next installment is just as good."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"Not bad, but not good: lukewarm.The storyline is relatively faithful to the Black Panther's origins story (mutatis mutandis), so one is not disappointed there, although in some moments the movie looks like a (bad) combination between Coming to America (1988) and The Lion King (1994).Some of the actors overact. This may be due to two things: too much green screen in the back and a poor strategy concerning the languages spoken by the characters throughout the movie. If possible, they could have invested more in the use of original african languages; the african/english accent doesn't work that well. Also, there's just too much CGI. With so much money, they could (should?) have invested in a trip to Africa to film on location, instead of just going to South Korea.Character development was somewhat forgotten. Characters are not that deep and are actually kind of accidental sometimes.A word on fight coreographies. Should have been much better! When first appearing on Captain America: Civil War, Blach Panther proved to be a skilled fighter, with a kind of unique fighting style, rivalizing with Captain America himself and the Winter Soldier. Now, in this movie, however, he looks very ordinary, devoid of the one on one martial skills he displayed before.Despite all this, I have to say two more things. One, the soundtrack is very good! All of it. Two, the depiction of Wakanda and the general african ambience, namely concerning some traditions and cultural aspects (real and/or fictional) deserve praise.Bottom line: entertaining, not a total flop, but still not good enough. They didn't exaggerate on the jokes (although they were funny), fortunately, which is a point in favor - the movie wasn't a joke, contrary to some tendencies that have been going around lately (e.g. Guardians vol. 2, Thor Ragnarok); but there was some bad writing and some bad directing, I have to say."
BLACK PANTHER,30 May 2018,10/10,"It may be named after its male lead, but don't let that fool you - this is the most girl-power film since, well, Wonder Woman. Full of smart, strong ladies who kick major butt, this film is more feminist than most movies aimed at women! Not to mention the almost Shakespearean royal power struggle at the center of the plot, the well-thought-out worldbuilding that draws respectfully on African culture, the super-cool tech, the humor, the fact that all the major characters are more well-rounded than in most superhero films . . . This is one case where you can believe the hype! It's a pure entertainment package that delivers on every level."
BLACK PANTHER,30 October 2018,1/10,"When i watched it for the first time i couldnt even remotley grasp the hype about it. They said it is groundbreaking, they said oh my god...a black role model....oh my god it¬¥s soooooo good cause there is a black super hero.Producing a show to even generate such an effect shows everyone clearly...there is a society deeply in denial and not even near the 21st century regarding their social development and exploiting this fact makes it even worse....Bottom line....some dude in costumes who does not sell crack is playing some obscure hero and everyone thinks its groundbreaking....WOW!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"Did I miss something? I swear, there is nothing about this film that's by any stretch is extraordinary or new or even worthy of an 88/100 on Metacritic. I'm expecting Lord of the Rings level here. If you're giving it that much praise, there's gotta' be something spectacular here. No, It's just another Marvel Blockbuster that recycles it's curriculum stories through and through it's exhausting. I mean, if someone can enlighten me and tell me the one or two things that make this such a groundbreaking, high-rated Superhero flick, then please. Because whatever is good in this movie is good, but it's delivers as much as any other comic book pic. Sure, it was a fun ride, well made, and a good time at the movies. But were there samples of cocaine handed out to critics in their screenings? Because this is no better than any Marvel movie that's come out in the last 5 years. In fact, I could name you 5 better superhero movies that have released in the last 3.
Listen, it's a good movie, but It never went to that place or convinced me it was worthy of all it's praise. It's clearly just overly-excited reviewers who want this to be good, and are are so consumed by the culture, that among all of our social insecurities sprinkled across social media, we just can't get enough of black guys in panther suites. Trust me, go and see this, but it's as good as any other Marvel movie. But their accents are pretty bad ass, I'll give you that."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,9/10,"I am a big comic fan. Both in the literal sense of my stature and weight, and in the extent in which I enjoy the medium. I rarely actually find time to read comics, despite having no real job or any other vacuum of time. Still, I can remember when I was younger and my attention span hadn't been eroded into nothingness. Back then, I had many favourite characters. There was the classics like Spider-Man, and the more niche choices such as Moon Knight. Somewhere in the middle was King T'Challa, or the Black Panther if you would prefer. I won't go the full route of claiming that, since I am of mixed race, a character of a racial minority helped guide me and give me confidence, acting as my sole role-model. Still, though, it was quite interesting as a child seeing the other half of what I came from. Granted, my great-grandfather was Jamaican, but the concept remains the same. I don't believe there is a mixed race superhero (though do please correct me if I'm wrong) but I also don't really need one. When I heard that Black Panther movie was announced, I quickly became nervous. Obviously, I was elated that one of my childhood favourites would finally be getting a big-screen adaptation. Still, I was worried that the film would push politics into my semi-developed brain. Recently, there's been quite the surge of people demanding representation. Obviously, this should happen. Black people exist, and they should be shown in film. The same goes for everyone else, regardless of race, gender etc. Personally, however, I feel this has come at the expense of quality. Finn, the first main black character in Star Wars, is an embarrassment in my mind. While many applauded Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, I feel both her acting, and the film as a whole, were lacking. She simply fits the character well, allowing her to pass semi-believably. I was horribly nervous that Black Panther would be yet another casualty to this. I thought he might abide by all black stereotypes by being loud, emotional and overly aggressive. Much to my relief, this film seemed to understand this, and avoid it.In the comics. T'Challa is a wise and level-headed king. Obviously, in the films, he is currently younger than he is often shown on the page, but these traits are still present. He is dignified and a strong leader, but isn't above enjoying himself every now and then. Unlike many other Marvel protagonists, T'Challa isn't cracking jokes mid-fight. He remains serious, grounded in the severity of the situations he finds himself in. He doesn't seem to find much pleasure in combat, he simply does it because, ultimately, it is often the right thing to do. The villain, on the other hand, is almost the polar opposite. In another film, Killmonger may well end up as the misunderstood Anti-hero protagonist. Here, however, he is treated as well intentioned but ultimately misguided. This is something I can respect. I was truly surprised by this film; I expected the protagonist and antagonist's personalities to be reversed, but I ended up with the film I didn't know I wanted.The characters are quite wonderful. Both T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri are handled wonderfully, and I could actually believe their sibling bond. In fact, Shuri (despite one horribly misplaced attempt at reviving a meme) ended up being one of my favourite characters in the film. She wasn't a stereotypical 'strong and independant woman' character. She was both of those things, but she also had her own flaws and imperfections, separating her from the ranks of Rey and Diana Prince. The writing in addition to Letitia Wright's wonderful performance made for a great character I'd love to see more from. Michael B. Jordan has an odd place in my superhero-oriented mind. I doubt I can forgive him for 'Fant4stic' but his performance in this film almost changed my mind. His character as shown in the trailers looked incredibly forgettable and one-note, but in the film, it's a very different story. I shan't give any spoilers for those who are yet to see it, but I doubt anybody will be left disappointed. It was definitely a direction I hadn't expected both Marvel and Disney to go in, and I'm incredibly pleased by the mature and politically neutral choices.I wasn't really a fan of Martin Freeman's character in Civil War (he was only really there to be in this, despite what his character's name may suggest) and he's perfectly serviceable in this. Honestly, rather ironically, he just seems to be here for diversity, in an attempt to show that not all white people are evil. Himself and Andy Serkis even took to calling themselves the marvellously titled 'Tolkien white boys'. Speaking of Mister Serkis, he seemed to be having an absolute blast. Each scene he was in was packed with energy. Unfortunately, he was horribly underused. I'd love to see him in some future films, as unlikely as it would seem.Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa, as I mentioned previously, was wonderful. I'm now nervous for Infinity War; I fear they may do the character an injustice by showing him too little, or writing him poorly. I do feel I can safely rule out the actor as a problem if anything goes wrong; this performance shows he can carry a film.It's rare that I'd give a whole section of a review to this, but the action was brilliant. The climax of the film was overly busy for my tastes (there was basically three fights going on at once) but each aspect was given a great deal of detail. While I am a novice in the subject, I believe I saw various different forms of martial arts at play during various duels etc. It was pleasant seeing real technique used rather than the classic Marvel method of 'hit him really hard' or 'shoot a laser'. It was also incredibly brutal; there was blood used frequently, and each punch actually looked like it hurt. Towards the end, there was a moment where there really should have been blood, but I feel censorship may have intervened; they probably want as many people to see this film as possible, children included. Personally, I would have rather seen the climax come down to a simple duel to really show off the choreography and talent at play. Nevertheless, the film was thoroughly enjoyable.The music was used incredibly intelligently. From the trailer, I feared it would all simply be rap music. I've nothing against the genre, but it wouldn't fit the comicbook character. To my relief, however, music was used incredibly intelligently. If you know of the musical 'Hamilton' you may understand. Within it, rap mostly follows the titular character, while the character of Aaron Burr is closer to RnB, featuring more vocal talent and soul rather than blisteringly quick verses. A similar technique is used here. T'Challa is accompanied by what I assume is classic African music, while Killmonger is followed by hiphop, fitting their characters brilliantly. Rather ironically, when the more traditional superhero music reared it's head, it was a disappointment. This film probably has the best music of any Marvel film. I'm actually considering buying the album by Kendrick Lamar in order to support the film further.Even from a regular film perspective, I think this film succeeded. The cinematography was gorgeous at times. It occasionally fell into the more standard, dull, static shots, but for the most part, it was great. The visual effects were also, as to be expected, impressive. Much like Iron Man, I found myself longing for a suit of my own. (Any scientists reading, add this to the list. Along with real Pokemon and so on.)There was a few minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, but compared to how I feel about many Disney films nowadays, I feel this film was, to put it simply, a marvel. It might simply be because I am writing this right after seeing it, but this is probably one of my favourite Marvel films period. I daren't give a 10, lest I regret it later, so instead I'll give it a 9.5/10. It was the most fun I've had in a cinema watching a film like this since Logan. I wish to thank Ryan Coogler, the cast and crew for smashing my expectations and restoring some hope in the Marvel franchise. Black Panther is now in cinemas, and I implore you all to watch it. For anyone wondering, there is two end credits scenes. One in the middle, and one at the end.(Completely unrelated, please be quite during a film viewing in the cinema? I appreciate this doesn't apply to 99.99% of you, so thanks, but while I watched this, there was a group of teenage girls behind me. They spoke through the entire film, so I now know which of the cast they'd most like to have sex with. Congratulations, I suppose, Mr. Jordan.)"
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,4/10,They truth is top Boring and very predicable but isnt thr worst m√≥vie oficina the history keep relaxing you'll forget it.
BLACK PANTHER,18 August 2018,10/10,WAKANDA FOREVER. Go see black panther if you have not what are you doing with your life
BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2019,10/10,"I loved the injection of culture in this movie!
The inclusion of traditions and beliefs was different, and set it apart from other Marvel films. For example- visiting the spiritual realm to see the elders, and the competition for the throne.
It is one of my favourite marvel movies alongside Infinity War. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews! It was both funny, and action-packed, without being too over the top funny like Thor: Ragnarok.
Thoroughly enjoyed this one!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 September 2020,10/10,"I seem not to understand why y'all rating this movie so low. It's a movie that says alot about our African culture & values but y'all white folks wont get it due to RACISM y'all so blind to see that.
A massive thanks To CHADWICK BOSEMAN for giving us our 1st black superhero character, we love you deeply forever. Rest in Power KING T'Challa"
BLACK PANTHER,3 January 2020,6/10,It is not even the best marvel film let alone the best movie ever.
BLACK PANTHER,23 May 2020,9/10,Superb CGI with good storyline. Amazing music. Good performances by actors. Overall an enjoyable experience.
BLACK PANTHER,11 January 2020,1/10,"I couldn't believe how silly this movie was.The marketing and hype around this film was crazy, when I finally watched it I couldn't believe that people were talking about the same movie.It's an empty feeling film lacking anything to keep an audience interested beyond mediocre special effects.The plot is silly, acting terrible, and the whole thing looks cheap and tacky.The only thing that worked for this film was it's marketing. It race baited people into buying tickets. Don't let these goons trick you, this film is rubbish."
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2020,7/10,"There is no clear theme and contradiction, no burning scene, and the plot is stingy, but what is interesting is the strange visual impact of African aesthetics mixed with high technology. Knowledge is power."
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2021,8/10,"I am not a fan of most superhero movies. I really enjoyed this though. The plot felt more like a fantasy story to me. The melding of present day with traditional and futuristic elements was well done. It's visually gorgeous and the use of language and accents is beautiful. T'Chala and Shuri have a great sibling relationship. It might be overlooked amongst all the fight scenes, but it's significant that the main battle doesn't end, because one side beats the other into the ground. It ends because one leader rethinks his actions and yields."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2021,5/10,May you Rest In Peace Mr.Boseman. This movie was boring it had no action like the rest of the marvel movies sure it had a couple of funny parts but I have no need to watch it ever again.
BLACK PANTHER,15 October 2021,7/10,"I finally got around to watching this .It was a pretty good super hero movie, but for me, not as amazing as some have felt.The visuals were fantastic and costumes incredible.I loved to the powerful black storyline and strong female characters.Pretty good story and themes.Definitely worth a watch."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2019,1/10,This movie sucks and was filmed entirely on a sound stage with way too much CGI and reliance on meme marketing to become successful. The actors embodies the character well but doesn't matter cause nothing was at stake that mattered and character actions contradict character motives.
BLACK PANTHER,4 November 2019,7/10,"From the start of the movie you could tell it was going to be predictable. The movie is a solid 7.0 out of 10, pretty much average for what you get. Nothing really that spectacular happened. It's quite forgettable, compared to Infinity War and Endgame."
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2018,10/10,I love the characters in this movie. I love the storyline in this movie. The fight sequence is off the hook. It gets a little cheesy but it's also great for kids so I understand. It's an emotional movie.
BLACK PANTHER,5 February 2019,2/10,This movie was stupid. Where to begin. Racially motivated.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Hail Wakanda! This has to be one of the best Marvel movies shown to date. First off, there is an actual coherent storyline. Basically, the movie is about inter-turmoil between Wakanda tribes on the subject of releasing their tech to the rest of the world. Some are against the idea as it will expose Wakanda to the world and some are all for it thinking it's for the greater good. The bad guy is pretty human by Marvel standards. In the end, he just wants to go home, gather his people and help save all the other oppressed people of the world. There is action but not as much as some people seem to like. There is no major alien/godly badguy to defeat. They are really just fighting themselves. The cast is colorful and you are not bombarded with stale jokes every frame (unlike Thor Ragnarok). I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10 stars. I do think the bad guy could have been a lot tougher to defeat and there were a few small items not clarified (So what do they do now that all the plants have been burned up?) but this was a pretty enjoyable flick"
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2020,10/10,"This is one of the best and I mean the Absolute best of the marvel movies franchise. Everything about this movie was on point! From the actors to the special effects and of course the plot of this movie was truly awesome. Passion, excitement, action, thrills with so much depth in it. Trust me anyone with eyes will love this movie. I've watched it at least 30 times and it never gets boring period. All the hype was honest, it's that simple."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,6/10,"This script deserves to be just coz a lot of black and cofee colored people would probably love it. Well most will just like it...
But this story line of avengers plot is falling out so, that is too much to tell and not ""enought spot"" to fit. That alone causes almost ""screw ups"" instead of fit easter eggs. 
Funky accents by far is a summary of the actors' crowd talents or something like that if one understands...
Overall it's a 4, plus 1 for the ""stream"", plus 1 for the funk. Strong 6 and it's must to be."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Ok when to see this movie with not may hypes, for me was another Marvel movie with a hero that we didn't know well. Only saw him at Civil war and that it is all. So Prince and King T ' Challa of Wakanda what an amazing back ground history they have give us. This movies is not for those that are expecting a lot of actions with no explanation, This movie was direct to give us the vide that was creating another phase in Marvel. The color , the special effect where amazing but over all the history was the most that I took from this movie. I love how the represent their traditions, their culture and that important of family unity. Prince or King T'Challa was amazing , now is understandable why they didn't cast any one else for this role he is Black Panther. As the lead role he make me felt all types of emotions watching the movie. He was just great I haven't other words to describe his excellent role.As his love interested , I was amazing how they play with the character, she was an important support character, but you can also see that she was special for him. Making her an spy that care for people well been outside of the city of Wakanda, was a magic touch. She represent what other cannot see the reality of 3 world countries. The Slavery and trade of woman and children's for sexual favor.There was two part that brought me back to my childhood favor movie Lion King and that only make even felt in love more with the movie. It was so much rich in almost everything.
The important that it to show to others the traditions and morals rights . This movie nail and that what make one of my top 5 marvel movies.
I am hoping the sequel touch even more reality that people live and suffer in the African continent."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,4/10,"I like Marvel movies. The whole superhero universe is quite entertaining. There have been a lot of them recently, and while the quality varies, they are usually at least decent.Now, don't pull the racist card, because I am in no way that kind of person. But this... had it not been for Stan Lees cameo and the Marvel logo at the beginning, I would have thought this to be some random b-flick with decent CGI. But even that seem somewhat half-assed.So we have these very developed high-tech bunch of people, with technology far beyond the reach of the rest of the globe, yet they make decisions based on the outcome of medieval combat? There was very little incentive to like the characters. The few puny attempts at ""humour"" was at best cringe-worthy. The whole thing didn't seem to have any connections whatsoever to the rest Marvel universe. A few connections might have been positive, because then at least there might be something to look forward to. But as a standalone movie, this serves no real purpose for the average moviegoer. And that's why I cannot see myself to rate it higher than 4 stars. And I really like Chadwick Boseman and Forrest Whittaker!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,4/10,"I'm fully aware of what type the Marvel movies are. I've seen them all and I can appreciate how the studio chose to present its stories and characters. Nothing too ambitious nor too stupid. Well design entertainment. Black Panther however is not like that.Production value in Marvel movies is there to overshadow possible drawbacks. Panther is sloppy in the production and since there are many drawbacks this movie is simply put - boring. CGI is rather good but when it's bad - it's very bad. It looks like several director assistants put this movie together. Few did very good job - the rest not so much. The result makes me want to compare this movie with the last DC... That's how bad it is. Story is yet another thing that made me scratch my head. This was pretty much a Marvel version of Amistad. Seems like yesterday, I know but why to put this theme in the movie? They wanted to compete for Oscars or something? Basically the story goes like this: Black folks are oppressed all around the world and there's secret, super advanced and resources-rich country in the middle of the poorest continent but they do nothing about the evil in the world. That's not even half of what is wrong with the story but you get the picture. Acting is something you never look too closely in Marvel movies simply because there's not much time for it. Slow moments are rather few and are well positioned in the story and well directed. Not here. Main character apart from crying 10 times does little to symphonized with him. Black Panther and his friends are so dull and uninteresting that I much more liked two main villains and theirs motivations. Seriously. And dialogues? Only the bad guys made sense here. ""Good guys"" talk and talk nonsense for hours. Not to give you some perspective or background but to save money on CGI (I guess). I pay no attention to details like music in Marvel movies. But here you cannot miss this. Soundtrack contains everything from typical rap, through typical African music to classical drama-like music. This would normally be good BUT. The way this music is implemented in the scenes would make you think ""wait, what?!?"". I rarely watch movie where soundtrack is making it worse not better. The list of what's wrong goes on...This is a bad movie, bad Marvel movie, and poor overall production."
BLACK PANTHER,25 May 2018,4/10,Nice costumes. Palace intrigue. Fighting. Bigotry. Nice CGI scenery. More intrigue. Token white guy. More fighting. King becomes SJW. The end. Okay for $1.75 rental I guess.
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2019,9/10,"I enjoyed seeing a high quality super hero film centered around people who look like me that are technologically advanced and live in a city in Africa. I loved the acting, story, and how it fit in with the other Marvel movies. The only thing I didn't like was the CGI in the subway fight scene. Everything else was great!"
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,3/10,"Black Panther isn't the masterpiece people are saying it is. But it does contain some thrills, and a fantastic cast that suits this film incredibly. Overall it's not a film I'd want to see again but I'm glad I saw it at least once."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is a fun and entertaining marvel movie. The acting is good, the plot is good and the villain has actually some good points. There is not as much humor in this as it was in ""Guardians of the galaxy"" but there is still some. Some of it lands, some of it does not.But is this a revoulationary movie from Marvel? No. It's basically what you would expect from a marvel movie. It's bit different of course, with the setting and the fact that almost the entire cast is black. But besides the cast, this really is not something we haven't seen before. That being said, this was still a very entertaining and fun superhero movie! So if you like Marvel movies I would recommend this, but if you are kinda tired of the marvel formula I would say there really is not any reason to see it."
BLACK PANTHER,3 June 2018,6/10,"Entertaining but only b/c of the female characters. The male characters (with two exceptions) had zero personality or depth. T'Challa's sister, girlfriend and general were the only reasons this movie held my interest. Give them their own movie already! Chadwick Boseman is a great actor but he's given so little to do in this other than act tough. Such a one-dimensional character. And Daniel Kaluuya's switch from good guy to bad guy back to good guy came with no apparent reason or explanation. And wait...did he have a relationship with the General? Don't know. And Forest Whitaker was DOA the whole movie. Wait...wasn't Sterling K. Brown in this? Can't remember. Come to think of it Angela Bassett was also given very little to work with. Snore. Martin Freeman's character had more charisma than all the above-mentioned characters put together. Such a waster of talent!At least Michael B. Jordan and Winston Duke's characters were given some personality that let them stretch their acting skills a wee bit. CGI was also pretty lame and plot holes were pretty wide. And what's Black Panther's super power anyway? He puts on a suit (created by his sister) and leaps around punching and scratching? The armored rhinos were more interesting and deadly. The best character in the movie was Wakanda itself. Make a movie about a high-tech country in the middle of Africa with a girl genius, a kick-ass female general and an endearing CIA agent. Leave out the super cat and all his stoic compatriots. I'd watch."
BLACK PANTHER,21 June 2018,3/10,I am now shocked at all the hype surrounding this movie. I found almost nothing to really like about it. It was also really predictable and tedious so....I turned it off and went to bed early and the next morning dropped it in the outgoing mail unfinished with no feelings of guilt.
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2019,8/10,"The best thing about this movie is the ambience, the colors and the story, it reminds me so much of the lion king that I can not help being influenced by my opinion, it is spectacular my only one but it is the horrible dialogue and marvel humor that I personally hate but it's the best I've seen of superheroes"
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,1/10,"Man I don't know why i keep going to these, maybe it's because I hope that they will get better scripts or be similar to a DC film but every time I am disappointed. Lets' see where do I start, I probably have to say that the story was by far the worst part of this movie, I mean come on Disney you have told the prince marries princess story to us in so many animated movies why did you have to make a live action one. The next complaint is the political commentary is over the top and doesn't fit with the story at all. The one redeeming quality that this movie has is the excellent comedy."
BLACK PANTHER,1 May 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is the best stand alone Marvel movie yet....and its not even close! The film starts out slow, but thats it...from there its just amazing. Sure it's a tad predictable but everything is top notch. I love the action and the acting.....Its tied with Avengers 1 as the 2nd best Marvel film (Infinity War)"
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,8/10,"A good movie, good special effects....but not so extraordinary like some critics or media says about it"
BLACK PANTHER,17 December 2018,4/10,"Overrated, over hyped, poor acting. The story is soooooo boring. Special effects are over the top."
BLACK PANTHER,23 October 2018,1/10,"Boring, dumb, propaganding hell knows what and very OVERRATED"
BLACK PANTHER,7 January 2019,9/10,"Of course the serious looks of t'chala is a bit dissapointing if you like thor or iron man,but it suits the character really well.And you will obviously love the acting of the crew-- clearly flawless."
BLACK PANTHER,9 February 2019,10/10,"It holds the top domestic box office of the year and is a cultural phenomenon with schools, churches, community groups and African-American celebrities buying out theaters. Some have compared the cultural significance of the film to ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" ""Martin Luther King Jr's speeches or Barack Obama being elected president.The film transcends the superhero genre, and its popularity and depth of examination from writers debating its portrayal of issues rarely discussed in mainstream news outlets goes into depths which superhero films rarely dare to venture. What is clearly evident is that Ryan Coogler has delivered three outstanding films in three attempts in different genres. He has done all three with Michael B. Jordan, whose outing here as the corrupted revolutionary Erik Killmonger is another in a long line of excellent performances. Chadwick Boseman made T'Challa the break-out character of ""Civil War"" and proves after headlining three biographical dramas that he is also an action star. Letitia Wright shines as Shuri, stealing every scene she is in, and standing out among the film's outstanding cast."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2020,8/10,"The movie has a very talented cast, amazing writing, good story, amazing villain. But the CGI in this movie is just awful, it really disgusts me, and the action is good, but not as good as I wanted it to be. Still a great movie.
Rank: B+"
BLACK PANTHER,13 June 2021,10/10,One of the best movies ever and the actor you don't get no better then this.
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2021,2/10,It not exactly a 2 but its current score is way too high. I think a 5 or 6 is realistic.
BLACK PANTHER,12 September 2018,10/10,I definitely LOVE this movie! I'm like a kid when I watch movies with lots of action and adventure! It is ridiculously AWESOME!
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2021,4/10,"So, one of my Bucket List entries is to work my way through the MCU movies, and as you can see, I have just finished Black Panther.....Infinity War is next.For the most part I have enjoyed them. Awesome special effects, bubble-gum stories, the odd laugh here and there - but Black Panther, I just don't get the praise heaped on it. I spent most of the movie saying ""who's that?"", ""where did that come from?"", ""what the hell is going on?""........ definitely one of least enjoyed of the MCU movies I have watched so far. And yet according to the critics, this movie is the new Godfather, and I just don't get it. Yeah, it's alright I guess, but Oscars etc...? I mean, c'mon, get real. I have a sneaky suspicion why, but if I voice that here, this review will never get posted...ya get me?"
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2019,10/10,"Glad I did not read these before I saw the movie. It's a marvel comic story for goodness sake! Based on these comments, you would think this was a non-fictional story. The movie was entertaining from beginning to end. WAKANDA FOREVER!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,4/10,"Movie seems to fail at every step from the start. It tries to be witty, smart, elegant at the same time, but lacks everything.
It seems that there is way too much conflict within Wakanda and among its ruler (family). This messes up the result of everyone deciding to support whatever cause or line of action they choose.
I didn't have any high hopes for this one, so I didn't get much downers for this, but most of all I didn't get any upper either. I get it that this relates to origin story of the new ""superhero"", but all I experienced was some weird version of Lion King."
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2018,1/10,I dislike doing bad reviews but I have to. From the opening sequence to what was that ..... to the where I totally zoned out and actually switched the dvd player off. Peeps I never do this
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,6/10,"These are the faults that i found1. The basic plot is average or even below. The screenplay seems like it was rushed, not much time was put into writing it. Some of the technology is way over the top and seem like taken out of a James Bond movie. The Villain is not interesting or interesting. I did not understand the reason for the presence of some characters 
2. The fight scenes are not spectacular or anyway near that. One shot is broken several times. I expected somersaults and panther like moves but not much came. There is even some ufc style of combat which brings us back to the point above. If research was done The writers would have known of the folk wrestling done by the Serer people in Senegal
3. The Production design was not applicable to this movie. Yes the Wakandans were extremely technologically advanced but i failed to consistently notice the African feel as it was overshadowed by western designs
4. The score was too Western. I expected marimba and mbira type of instruments not the same old scoreThe good thing i noticed is the acting, the actors made the most of what they were given."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,2/10,"Plenty of visual fodder, okish acting.Does nothing to further the Marvelverse in the run up to Infinity War.Some unnecessary humor in sombre places.The worst thing about this movie is that you can see that the characters pretend they value rule of law, tradition and democracy until they are on the losing side. Then it's just popularity contest.Basically a 2 hour BLM film with a bit of feminism thrown in.You could miss this movie and it wouldn't make a difference to the Marvelverse."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"I must say I am slightly biased because Marvel movies are my favorite movies but WOW. Black Panther is a really great movie. It has a great story with some unexpected twists. It is a great script that was brought to life by a phenomenal cast. Chadwick Boseman is a perfect T'Challa and Black Panther. Micheal B Jordan provides a great performance as Erik Killmonger and the character has really good depth and a back story that makes him a convincing Bad Guy, possibly the greatest MCU villain we've seen yet. T'Challa's little sister Shuri steals many of the scenes she is in. Wakanda is beautiful and the movie was beautiful. Black Panther is made up of a predominately African American cast as it should be and provides and rich culture and shows us what an African nation would look like if it wasn't conquered. This is very much a political movie as it is a superhero movie. The fight scenes were mostly great and well choreographed. Some little weaknesses were the CGI wasn't perfect and it was a bit slow at the beginning. There are 2 after credit scenes that are both important. But I will be seeing this movie again in theaters. #WakandaForever"
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,,"Marvel superhero movies are always good fun, I enjoy almost every movie in the MCU, except Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 . However, they all follow the same formula and they never really try anything too unique, and that trend continues with Black Panther.
Like every other film in the MCU series, it is an entertaining blockbuster, but that's all it is. The idea that I'm meant to fawn over this film because it has black people in it is insulting, and it almost makes me want to hate the film, but I respect Marvel too much to let my perception of this film be swayed by ridiculous, leftist fans. Overall it is a good movie that I will enjoy watching again, but it is nothing special."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,7/10,"It's a pretty good movie but not nearly on par with the original Avengers or Civil War for the best MCU movie. If I were to compare this to another MCU movie I guess it would be Thor. Both T'Challa and Thor are the heir apparent to their kingdoms and must challenger to the throne. However, whereas you could sympathize with Loki's jealously of Thor, the level of hostility that Killmonger has towards T'Challa never seemed appropriate to me. Nor did I totally accept the circumstances surrounding T'Chaka's little secret. While the film may be worth seeing just to get a better view of the 'black' perspective of the world we live in, these small story details really dragged the movie down a bit for me. I really wished they spent more time with Killmonger's background as he had the potential to provide the most complex character/villain in the MCU universe. But instead we're left with just another standard villain who is overcome with rage and just wants to kill everyone."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,5/10,"Sure the movie was predictable. Kinda reminded me of the old Black TV series like ""The Jeffersons"" where the White people played the minimalist roles. I'm watching on Netflix and quit when the second duel for the throne starts, like the villain would really be defeated before his dastardly plan ever gets off the ground? C'mon man. Personally I didn't get off on the movie, I'm a just regular film goer looking for entertainment. Move along"
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2020,10/10,This movie helped define what we are going through in 2020. It was well written and well acted and Boseman will be the only Black Panther I recognize for the remainder of my life.
BLACK PANTHER,28 September 2018,8/10,"First off I will start by saying I am about the most honest reviewer on the planet. I like to say it like it is.Second off I will say that I have an HD projector with a 100 inch screen in my basement with a full surround sound. This can make a huge difference when watching a movie. Especially with action movies.I thought this movie was brilliant. Here is why.
It is completely different to anything I have seen of late. The cast for a start. A mainly all black African American cast in a big screen movie. It just brought a whole new dynamic to the film.The cinematography was unreal in this movie. I kept commenting all the way through it. I loved the whole African setting for a superhero movie. Again something different.The music. An entire album was written for this movie and it's a very good album. How often does that happen?I felt the acting was pretty decent. The storyline I didn't mind. I judge a movie based on the movie. Not on how the storyline was like the lion king or some other movie. What has that got to do with anything?People of imdb what in the hell dictates a 5 star movie never mind an 8 or a 9 if this movie only gets a 1 star. 
1 star. 1 star?????????? Are you serious? I am literally laughing at the thought of what people think a bad movie is. I've seen horrendous movies and I mean terrible movies but i still gave them a 3 for what they did right. I gave this movie an 8 star and that is a true retrospective of the entertainment value that this movie provided me with on my given night to watch it.Don't be put off by terrible biased reviews. Judge for yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,3/10,"A few of the actors could have been good, if they had a better script and direction.
Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o where especially bland. Found myself hoping they would be killed off by the end.Plot was the same as every other heroes quest plot. Except with less (zero) hero development. I've seen Roger Ramjet and Banana Man episodes with more hero development than the entire movie. Not even close to Marvel's lowest standards.Same for the villain. He was more vanilla than villain. Although he just barely had more character than the Hero.Fight scenes where dull, poorly motivated, poorly filmed and had little reason or logic. for the 40% where I could see what was going on I was mostly wondering why it was going on and why they weren't trying harder. I've seen better action filmed with a vibrating phone and posted to youtube with the wrong aspect ratio.CGI was horrible and glaringly obvious so much so they actually had special sound effects to warn you that the cgi was happening. Sound effects also had bad computer generated sound. Like 80's video games had a love child with 80's synth. The Black Panther suit was especially bad, Looked some kind of bulletproof hologram. Which could have been cool if thats what they where going for.Picture quality was really bad. I watched on a V-Max screen. It was very blurry. Not sure if this was just the cinema or if its the source material. Seemed to be worse in some places than others so likely the cinematography.
 Fight scenes where shaky and poorly framed, Futuristic city was out of scene, blurry and not very futuristic or believable. Looked like someone over polished a generic USA city and badly photo-shopped into India, not Africa. Except they still had bad (American) graffiti tags in the background. Was all shiny metal from a distance then grafiti concrete when up close... Overall was very confusing, not sure if futuristic slum was the angle or if was simply edited by a blind person who was so drunk they forgot half the cgi backgrounds.From a sci-fi point of view the futuristic tech was also really bland, clunky and left me wondering why.Politically The theme of hating everyone thats not descendant from Africa was simmering away the whole time. Found that pretty off-putting. Its not 1970 anymore. Re-visiting the politics of the Black Panther political party was pretty crass.Overall it left me with the impression that the marvel no longer wants to produce the content that made them famous but still want to cash in with out putting the effort in. Don't pay to see this. Might be worth watching on free to air tv if you're really bored and only get one station."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,8/10,"This time I agree with the same old cliche dialogue ""The best marvel movie till date"" Undoubtedly the best standalone movie made by marvel studios.The story starts right after the events happened in CA : Civil War. The movie starts in slow pace, but once the Killmonger gets introduced the story shifted into a fast pace momentum. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa scores just like he did in Civil war. But the real performer - Michael B Jordan plays the brutal Killmonger steals the show especially in the climax area.The movie is well balanced with right amount action and humor. No one liners or jokes in between battles. Cinematography is another one which eligible for a round of applause.The way they showed Wakanda.So much detailing in every aspect. With a perfect color tone, well managed CGI and some kick ass stunts the entire movie delivers a different experience for me."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,6/10,"Gotta say that i am wondering whats up with the critics nowadays Theyve been raving about this movie but to be honest, its nothing special or nothing new. Its a solid marvel movie but nothing to get all hyped up about. Michael B jordan and t'challa's sister are the highlights but in terms of action, special fx and storyline, it really wasnt anything above any other marvel movie. Its success is half due to the ethnic background/history of the movie industry and half due to the critics overblown reviews. I wouldnt watch it again"
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,1/10,Very slow. Boring. Decent acting I suppose. What's the main point of this movie?? All in all its way too long and very dull.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"Lots of action, cool weapons,some really bad ass female char haters, I probably would give it an 8 or 9 but figure I had to offset the hatersdoes it proselytize a little, yes. Is it, like most movies, aimed at a specific audience, yes. Does a deliver as a Marvel action hero movie yes. The CGI , the humor, the action: all meet the usual marvel standard. You won't be disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,6/10,"I just want to mention that the message of Martin Luther King Jr. won out Malcolm X when they finally met and discussed opposing viewpoints, Malcolm would later change his way of thought and acknowledge that Dr.King was right. After all the message of Dr. King was one grounded in the truth of Jesus Christ and which borrowed from Ghandi's own movement against similar opposition from the English and yielded success, that coupled with the support of JFK who likewise borrowed from Abraham Lincoln and we have a model that cannot be denied. Therefore let us all pray as Dr. King prayed for peace, forgiveness, harmony, oneness, understanding and respect for everyone and everything which is a center piece of the beleifs of Ghandi but which all Christians must likewise support. This movie inadvertently appears at a time when the movie makers decided that enough controversy exist (Captain America's Civil War and last years sad and disturbing KKK riots in Charlottesville, we are not in the 60's anymore! ) in the world that it would generate enough interest and thereby sales to garner success for its efforts. While the marketing strategy succeeded, the moral implications should not be ignored specifically as mentioned above regarding all efforts toward harmony and peace in all areas concerning the social attitudes, beleifs and values of all the peoples living in this great country. It with great hope that the writers show every bit of responsibility in the upcoming films to remember that this is the true direction of a hero such as the one played by Chadwick, is for peace, forgiveness. Letting go of the past and embracing the future as harmonious beings seeking to heal and help each other as we work towards a brighter future must be the aim of our leaders that must be seasoned in the lessons of our past and dutifulminded to steer clear of repeating them, forgiving the wrongs and adhering to the right in our evolution to continue to raise the bar for the human condition. 
 On a side note please make sure that the comic code authority (a guideline to ensure that children would be protected from harmful messages or stories) is restored to comics, there are many comic books that have many harmful messages in them, parents take note that Marvel and DC comics got rid of the comic code Authority when they went corporate in an effort to make more money. Comics were always for children and still are, why are we not more concerned about the safety of their highly impressionable minds, please contact both Marvel and DC comics to pressure them about this issue for it will not go away. 
One last note regarding DC and the new Black Lightning t.v. show, the actor is great but the costume is really lame, he should have a black costume with small yellow lighning bolts near the neck or the left breast and a simple black mask that covers most of his face. The costume could be bullet proof but not mechanical, he is not Iron Man and he can fly via the lightning powers, finally he should make his debut in the Justice League Movie. One more point the actor who plays Martian Manhunter (also an African American actor) is really great in the role as the Martian, except his powers due to a low budget on the Supergirl series expires quickly, can you give him his full powers and have him also in the Justice League movie, he has always been a major character in the series."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Look, I came to this movie with excitment, and with an open mind. I didn't even watch the trailer for the movie, the movie got so much hype and good reviews from pplaces like Rotten Tomatoes at 98% making it the highest scoring superhero movie and Imdb with a 7.8 rating. People were saying best superhero movie ever, Michael B Jordans villain was the best villian in movie history, the villian was better than Heath Ledgers Joker, did you read that, b-e-t-t-e-r than Heath Ledgers Joker, okay now you've crossed the line. Michael B Jordans preformance as the villian was good, but in no way does it stand next to The Joker.Plot: The plot for this movie was set up in a good way, it reminded me of The Lion King, which I think was better than Black Panther. Except it got boring, I never have nearly fell asleep in a movie, even in the action scenes. It got pretty boring and really, really futeristic. It got boring because of a lot of talking but I didn't really care about characters dying, Sometimes I didn't even get the big deal about someone dying. Actors: I have to give props to the actors in the movie, most of all Andy Serkis, who is usually a monkey actor for Planet Of The Apes, and King Kong. I am glad Andy got a chance to show his other acting skills to the world even though he is already a brilliant actor and very underrated. Overall Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and the lady supporting actors like Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were really good as well.Editing and CGI: There was a lot of CGI in this movie for obvious reasons and mostly because the movie is so futeristic with extreme technology and flying things and things like that. Other places included scenery and landscapes like waterfalls and other nature were very good and they nailed that.Feedback: To be raw this isn't the superhero movie I was looking for. This wasn't anything like Spiderman Homecoming or other Marvel movies, which it doesn't have to be exactly like other movies it's just they coulld have made this movie a lot more intriguing and interesting. The hype really wasn't needed for this movie but it was mostly the African American people really excited about a new Black superhero, which I understand because if they made a movie surrounding my country people will get really excited to because pretty much all movies are based in America because America always gets the spotlight. But It was great to finally have a Black superhero for a change instead of having a predominatly white American superheros, and It's great that they are spreading superheros to other areas around the globe and I hope they continue to do that for places like Europe, Australia and other places around the world. But saying the movie is a really good film because it is a Black Superhero isn't the way to judge how good a movie is. This movie got boring for me and that is just my opinion but it seems a lot of other people agree as well. It was over hyped, huge budget, but really boring and nearly put me to sleep. I give Black Panther a 5.5/10, The best part was Andy Serkis's character."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Beyond the hype, this film just served as yet another tedious example of a poor script in a played out genre. Lots of great eye-candy but not much more. All sizzle and no steak."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"First of all, the colors in this movie were gorgeous. The various sunset scenes or the scenes on the ancestral plane just felt so alive and so beautiful. I guess I'm too used to the old washed out ""realistic"" palette most films favor now where real is shades of brown and grey but Black Panther was just a feast for my eyes with the brilliant colors blasted across the screen. This ties into the fact the outfits were lovely and pretty much like nothing that's seen on the silver screen too much. The whole Pan African inspiration slash futuristic technopunk vibe, I really enjoyed it. I only thought one piece looked back and that was Okoye's (Danai Gurira) wig in the casino scene but given she throws it at an attacking goon I'm sure the bad wig was intentionally. And of course the Panther suit looked really good especially with the lights they gave it to signal how charged it was with kinetic energy, I'm glad they chose purple for T'Challa and gold for Killmonger's suit as those are both royal colors which makes sense for the characters but also breaks they old cliche of Good Guy in Blue and Bad Guy in Red.The set pieces and scenery(both real and computer generated) were very gorgeous. I liked the big rocks that looked like panthers and gorillas, it brought an epic feeling to the movie something like the Pillars of Kings did for the LOTR movies. Shuri's lab looked very clean, bright, and sparkly which I thought fit the character's personality very well so I'm sure that was an intentional choice and a good one.I loved almost every single character in the movie and became quite invested in their storylines. I thought certain characters fell a little flat(Everett Ross doesn't really have much going for him other than he's a US government agent and W'Kabi wasn't very interesting) but I think that might have been a time issue where their roles were cut down to keep the movie from running overly long and the characters still worked well in the story so I can't complain.I did not expect to laugh as much as I did in the theater, there were some parts where the whole audience cracked up and we were all roaring together. That was great, Marvel's been real good at snappy one-liners and quick jokes and this movie definitely keeps that alive. Klaue and Shuri were the ones with most of the laughs but both had a lot more going on than just being comic relief so it never became grating.Killmonger is, hands down, the best Marvel villain so far. He's got a complex mix of personal motivation and ideological motivation which makes him a heck of a lot more interesting than the old and tired ""money, dear boy"" or ""i just want to rule the world because reasons"" motivations you typically find for superhero movie villains. Michael B Jordan I thought played him fantastically, his performance was extremely charismatic, I'm just sorry to see the character leave so soon. To me it didn't make sense to have T'Challa repeat the same mistakes as T'Chaka did by killing his blood but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact T'Challa is shown to actually be making changes to solve the problems that allowed the villain to become who he was in the first place. I still wish they had kept Killmonger on though instead of killing him, that's the most fun I've had watching a Marvel villain since Loki.The romance of the fill was very smooth, it did not disrupt the plot or hog screen time. Such a breath of fresh air! Though hopefully it will be explored more in Black Panther sequels. You can tell there's much more to it than what was shown and I'd like to see T'Challa and Nakia together as opposed to the separate exes-in-love-still thing they had going in this movie.This movie also proposes some heavy questions. Is it right for an advanced nation to be isolationist while disadvantaged people suffer around the world? Is violence the only means free a class from oppression or can it be done peacefully? What is the cost of the lost identity many black Americans have with their ancestral homeland of Africa and how heavy do the chains of slavery still weigh on the black men of the US? The movie also speaks strongly in condemnation of colonization and the looting of the natural resources of Africa by foreign powers. It's a thinker as well as your good old smash-bang-flip superhero movie. It ends hopefully, it doesn't leave you feeling down despite the heaviness of the questions it raises and that makes it worth so much more to me. We all need hope. We all need to believe the future will be a brighter place than the present. We all want to believe in heroes. I think it's crazy this movie is only resting at a 7.9 at the time of this review. I think a lot of the negativity is probably bitterness that this movie continues to outperform standard fare at the box office and people are hating it because it's been so popular to praise. And there's definitely some spoil sports trying to sink a black-directed and majority black cast movie, unfortunately that's the world we live in. Insert the Kanye shrug here, some people are just determined not to have a great time.I can't find a single solid thing to complain about here in this movie hence my 10. I eagerly await the sequels to this."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,2/10,"This movie wasn't as good as people say it was. Black Panther did have a very good villain, but other than that it was pretty boring. Nothing even remotely entertaining happened until the final battle. Even Stan Lee's cameo was bad. But I have to give this movie a 2/10."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,"Black panther had great visuals, great colours and clothes and costumes, the afro-futurism concept is fine, actors too but the action is poor and also the dialogues, cool music tho, i'm a little dissapointed i am a Marvel fan so what can i say better was Captain America and The Avengers in my opinion, i hope that Venom won't dissapoint me. I almost died from boredoom when they were fighting so no surprise i figured the action out, they had no element of surprise Captain obvious was there too"
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,4/10,"Ever since i watched the trailer and they started using this 'all black' marketing strategy, it kind of showed there is nothing else in the movie. But my friends recommended it so I gave it a go (later I came to know they haven't seen many marvel films). Sadly I was disappointed as this an average flick. Storywise, there is nothing much. It starts well, entertaining and made me curious. But sadly after 30 min or so, it turned into a below average film. No consistency in characters. W'Kabi turns negative all of sudden and surrenders in the end all of sudden? Ulysses Klaue character was well setup, but ends suddenly!. The story, scenes are pretty much loopy, predictable and long, poor dialogues (like - are you ok?, yes i'm ok). So many scenes are redundant, two long challenge scenes with same pattern and same dialogues and length, long drinking the potions scenes, three times getting buried and visiting ancestor - could have trimmed these repeating scenes, but it could cost the movie length badly i suppose as there is nothing else to show. Couple of good action scenes, though climax is a war sadly nothing worth mentioning.Good performances from all of them. King's sister was brilliant and funny. The girlfriend and general did their part brilliantly. Andy Serkis was good but nothing much to it in the story, Michael B. Jordan was menacing, but not doing much after that. Chadwick Boseman physically he looks like a kid in the challenge scenes (maybe he is nothing without black panther potion!).Overall good CGI and performance, but because its poorly written it fails to engage. I dont understand the hype and biased reviews! maybe it has something to do with 'all black' thing instead of based on how the movie actually is."
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,8/10,It's very rare we can consider superhero movies to be art. well; here we go.
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,7/10,"To say that Black Panther is the best Marvel movie of 2018 feels pointless since we have yet to see the rest of 2018's Marvel films, including Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Venom. This film created a massive wave of audience and critical praise as if it were a landmark. This is primarily due to how it managed to shine the spotlight on a fictional African universe that was visually as appealing as Thor's universe, Asgard. For many people of African decent, this was their movie. However this wasn't the first black comic book film to be released as many say it is. It may be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but if you're asking for the first comic book film based on a black protagonist, the Blade franchise beat Black Panther to it. What Black Panther is is Marvel's first African superhero film to take place in the MCU, set in his country with the majority of the secondary characters being African themselves. The fact that there are fewer white skinned protagonists in the film than there are black gives it great significance. In that aspect, Black Panther succeeded to make a superhero film set in Africa. Culturally, it hit home, as fictitious as it is. That goes for the characters, who were not only likable, but great to watch as the heroes of the film. It just goes to show anyone of colored skin can portray great, appealing and heroic characters. The character of T'Challa/Black Panther is about as heroic as it gets. Following his story from Captain America Civil War, we are given a different T'Challa, the noble, brave king willing to sacrifice himself for his people and for all rather than the T'Challa driven by vengeance in Civil War. The other characters also fit in well in the world of Black Panther, most of them anyways. The Black Panther suits visually appear stunning and are taken to new levels of power.The hype of a film can often times succeed or ruin the experience for some 
viewers expecting to witness a triumph in film making history but were given instead a shipwreck. This was sadly the case for Black Panther as the film wasn't without obvious problems that take away from it's highlights. Black Panther was not a disaster either though it was no where near being the best of the Avengers Universe franchise. 
 
For starters, the film's main antagonist, a believable performance delivered by Michael B. Jordan, brings forth new aspects to a villain not often seen in films including films from past MCU entries. A villain character who creates turmoil for audiences and leaving them undecided as far as their feelings go towards the character, are they for him or against him? That is immediately a win going for the film. Michael B. Jordan's character's motivations for doing what he does are understandable to the point where one feels great sympathy for him despite being the ruthless villain that he is. That is a special ability whenever a film goes for that impact. Although for the first act of the film he remains hidden in the shadows with the spotlight landing on Andy Serkis' character, who kills his role perfectly as he always does. Serkis plays such an interesting character, one that isn't performed through motion-capture performance as he is known for the most, that it is a shame he got killed off. Furthermore it feels like a mistake that the film killed him for he had excellent hero/nemesis dynamic opposite T'Challa. Jordan however is excellent as a villain and deserves recognition for this role since his last experience in a Marvel film did NOT work well for him.The film's CGI was not the best compared to it's predecessors in the MCU especially towards the end. That said, the third act feels completely contrived. As if the film was desiring to reach it's finale much sooner than it needed to be in order possess a natural flow. Not to say that the final battle was not impressive at all or fun to watch but compared to a film like Batman Begins, Black Panther did not have the same final battle between hero and villain vibe that a superhero film should have where the hero after going through much trial rises to the challenge and even then it is not easy for him/herThe best moments of the film were mostly during the first act, with the car chase in South Korea being the show stopper for the film. The rest of the film deserves an average score in this reviewer's opinion. What mostly saved the film were it's talented actors and familiar faces from past popular films and television series. Another positive aspect is how the film took a shift from the MCU's past films that contained excessive humor (Thor Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man Homecoming). The serious dramatic change gave the film a necessary good feel, however it did contain moments of humor. Black Panther has been called out for having vague similarities with Disney's The Lion King, strangely enough they have some things in common here and there, not to say it is an issue. The fact of the matter is it could have been much more extraordinary had they put more thought to the second and third acts, the weakest moments in the film. Regardless, it was a good addition to the MCU. Up next we have Avengers Infinity War coming soon and it is easy to assume many will be looking forward to placing it above this and many other comic book films released before it. It probably might turn out better than Black Panther. In conclusion, credit where credit's due. This just doesn't feel like the best Marvel has to offer for this year."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,8/10,"While I enjoyed this movie, I became aware that I didn't follow the comic as a kid because I was either growing up and more interested in girls , motorcycles and cars or I was getting super hero fatigue. I decided after this movie was over that it was super hero fatigue and that I'm growing weary with the MCU films. I'm going to suck it up and see Infinity Wars for closure. Who knows maybe Deadpool will change my mind. Don't let the low rating reviews sway you. You're going to see a comic book on film, after all. Cheers!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,1/10,"I'm not sure what movie critics were watching when they gave this a positive review, but this movie barely warranted one star. The acting was terrible, the plot was substandard and the premise was ridiculous. Definately an agenda behind all the hype. Furthermore, it's regretable that a movie such as this got so much attention when Hostiles and The Shape of Water went under the radar."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2019,7/10,"Not the best film of this genre. Best bits were the editing, CGI and soundtrack"
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2019,6/10,"Yeah I don't really liked this movie.When I first saw it,I would give it a 7/10 but after some rewatches I realised that it has a lot of flaws.The good stuff is the fantastic music,the very good performance by Michael Jordan,and Killmonger was actually very well writen.And the last good thing that I can thing is the costumes and the worldbulding.But it has a lot of hot garbage holding it back.For example a lack of real tension because Black Panther is fucking pulletprof.The Third act ruins the movie,it's just a stupid fight between two CGI cats.WHERE IS THE FUCKING TENSION???But you know,is just bland and really not that interesting.I didn't care about anyone on this movie,because Avengers 3 was coming,and we knew that Black Panther would be in Infinity War.Why was this on the Best Picture nominations when first man was way better?"
BLACK PANTHER,8 October 2019,1/10,"Let me start by asking why the Hell did this overrated piece of propaganda trash get nominated for an award? This may be the worst MCU film i have seen yetThe Fact that they made Killmonger a crybaby is one thing, throughout the whole movie he is always saying that his people never got a proper chance at life meanwhile at Wakanda Black Panther is crowned king but has to fight the Horrible looking ""Man Ape"" then he is officially made king so Everyone serves the king Remember that, later on Black Panter goes after Ulysses Klaw ( who is the only cool thing in the movie) in Korea for some weird reason, after he is done with that Killmonger comes to challenge T'challa for the throne so naturally they go to the edge of a waterfall so Killmonger can push off the cliff, plot armor must be strong because He survives the fall and finds a group of people that decide to help him fight Killmonger and the army of Wakanda, When The war starts the women turn against Killmonger even though the leader said they will always serve the king no matter who it is, Black Panther tackles him into a big underground Railroad station they then have like a 3 second fight and Black Panther Kills him and throws him into the ocean and thats it. Can't believe people think this is a Great movie."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,5/10,"Everyone praised 'Black Panther' and said it was different compared to other run of the mill superhero movies that are aplenty in the recent times (barring 'Spiderman Homecoming').Well, 'Black Panther' is the same run of the mill superhero movie. Period!The only interesting bits are the cool African accent of the English language and some interesting African beats accompanying an otherwise mundane and uninspired, mostly EDM BGM.Not worth watching!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2020,1/10,"This movie was overrated, overhyped, to coddle a certain group of people. I don't rush to the movies to see it based on the race of actors, unlike the majority of the movie goers that liked this movie.
The storyline was lame, the acting was terrible, and just plain boring. My wife and I fell asleep the first time we tried to watch it, and the second time we struggled to get through the whole thing. Easily one of Marvels worst movies to date. The only Marvel movies that may have been worse were Ed Norton's Hulk, and Captain Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2020,1/10,"This movie reminded me of the 80s space movies. You have an advanced society, space ships and mordern technology, and yet they are fighting with swords and spears. You know it's all downhill from here."
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,8/10,It is a very good movie it is well written with an interesting plot and character. MBJ and chadwick Boseman shines it is extraordinary.
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2021,8/10,"Wakanda is much more advanced than the outside world....
but why did they use primitive means to determine a new king?"
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2020,3/10,"It gets three stars because it is a Marvel film so of course it looks good.Other than that what a let down.
Ponderous, pointless, and slow.The back story was just absurd and the characters dull and boring.
I don't know if it was the sound track but the voices were muffled and difficult to understand at times. Many actors were wooden and it felt almost like an amateur cast albeit beautifully shot."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,1/10,"Just like most recent Marvel movies, there's just nothing special about this movie. My biggest complaint is just how unrealistic the fight scenes look. It looks more like a choreographed dance than a real fight."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,7/10,"The conflict was shallow and one dimensional. They both wanted to give away their technology, just in different ways. Marvel could make an entire movie over two librarians fighting over an Oxford comma. I'd like to see real deep-seated disagreement like libertarians fighting socialist. This movie belittles real conflict and makes wars and conflict seem so trivial (most Marvel movies do). They make it seem like people just fight over nothing. 
Another thing that didn't make sense was the villain waited to challenge the young king, when he could've challenged the old king and had a higher chance of success. Apparently by the movie rules he can challenge whenever he wants. 
I can see why racists won't like this movie. It's very Africa centric. The bad white guy had more character than the good white guy (there are only 2 white people)."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2018,8/10,"The way a comic book story should be. Some of the dialog sounds short and cliched but there is ample action and some good one liners to make you smile. I noticed that this film had similarities to several other movies. Not saying this one copied them because it is part of the Marvel Universe franchise. A mix of Superman, Star Wars, Narnia, James Bond and Wonder Woman to name a few parallel themes. I wonder if Wakanda is anywhere near Zamunda and how does vibranium prevent over population? I rated it an 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"Too weak scenario with a lot of indifferent scenes.
Director made the mistake to have almost all the cast with the same haircut and clothes, making them hard to distinguish from each other.
They all speak with an accent which is a mix of Jamaican and South African. When they don't speak jibberish that is. It shows that it isn't natural sooo much.
The plot reminds me the ""ingenuity"" of Nickelodeon series (yeah, that childish).
Hindu movies have achieved better immitations of James Bond.
I'm sorry for the time I wasted. I almost slept in the theater."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"I read Black Panther comics in the 70's and was looking forward to this movie since it's announcement. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Ryan Coogler's 3rd directorial installment in a visually stunning and character driven superhero movie. Killmonger was just as nuanced as ""Homecoming's"" The Vulture which was refreshing as the comic book version was one dimensional. I loved the supporting characters namely Shuri, Nakia, Okoya and especially Mbaku.
My critiques were that the first half was a bit slow and the CGI was poor in certain spots. Given the fact that disgruntled critics driven from Rotten tomatoes have apparently found their way to IMDB ( no reason for 1 star reviews) I've added an extra star."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,10/10,"Oh My Goodness! Tight script. Outstanding storyline. Never seen before stunts and choreography. We laughed out loud, we cried, we cheered. We were shocked, surprised, and we were marveled. We were completely entertained. I will buy this, once on Blu-ray, for myself and as a gift for friends & family."
BLACK PANTHER,16 August 2018,10/10,"The way they cinematically weaved this Marvel Fantasy into today's (not widely talked about) Technological (nanotechnology) as well as futuristic technology will electrify-electrifying capabilities. I'm hooked! Waiting for the sequel, Black Panther: The Wake of a Nation."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,10/10,"This movie Was Just Stunning. This was a GREAT Marvel film and wonderful step forward for inclusion. It touched on a lot of important issues, while giving me the action I needed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! The beginning, middle and ending all tire together perfectly for a comprehensive story to feast on. Family secrets and revenge is the core of the story that makes a compelling story. The humor comes effortless that will make you laugh out loud and the action scenes are the icing on the cake. I went into it less hyped than many other marvel movies, but came out preaching it was one of my new favorites! The cast is amazing and the acting/drama a perfect mix with the humor. I love love love the strong women characters!!! A MUST SEE!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 September 2020,10/10,"This movie is an experience unlike any other I've had at the movie theater. I ended up seeing it again because I wanted to rewatch it with some friends who still hadn't seen it, and to also see their reactions. They of course loved it. Also loving Kendrick Lamar makes the movie and the overall feeling watching it ten times more enjoyable, as I ended up having the Black Panther album on repeat in the months after the movie came out. This movie most notably elicited a very memorable and important moment in time for a lot of Black audiences/creators, who unfortunately aren't used to superhero's that look like them represented so well, and not just one but a whole cast of incredible Black talent. Daniel Kaluuya who I remember from Skins and Black Mirror (where he was literally the definition amazing), only for Get Out to come and blow our minds entirely. Things like that is made the film incredible and impossible to forget. RIP Chadwick! Listening to the music and watching his other work since his passing has created a painful, but humble emotional nostalgia within me that no recent films can compare to, and I'm grateful for him and his impact, as many are."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"1. Overall: 8/10; Not as great as some of the rave reviews on imdb, but not bad at all. Good that the plotline is different to other Marvel solo movies which simply recycle Iron Man (like Ant Man or Dr Strange did). The plot is actually quite good and coherent.2. Almost Isolated: Yes the only connection to the MCU comes in the post-credits scene where we see Bucky recovering. But, while it worked in this movie i hope th2 upcoming phase 4 movies are not all so isolated from each other. I personally liked the concept of MCU characters appearing in each others' movies and giving a real sense of continuity.3. Klaue - Serkis: Wasted; in that they wasted a great actor on a character who is ultimately used as a pawn and eliminated early. Andy Serkis got waaaay less screen time than i would have liked.4. Finally a relatable villain: Although he was tamed by T'Challa in the end; N'Jabanga (or wtv his name is) is actually a compelling character. Want to see more of that in the MCU"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,6/10,"Did had the chance to watch it on the theater. when the blueray released, i checked it out and watch it with my family.i dont know i didnt like it probably because i was watching it on a 65 inch smaller screen as to theater.its another story where the hero was overthrown and he came back. one man to overthrow the hero's kingdom. the fight scenes are terrible. the CGI was very good though.appreciate 99% of the characters are black. and its probably a very big budget movie starring all blacks. i hope ""inclusions and diversity"" is not reason why the hype was created like the way we nominate the Get Out (2017) movie for best picture, director, actor..etc.PS: i am not being racist, i love Denzel and Sidney's movies like hell."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is back after Civil War! Before, I was assured myself that this movie would be the best superhero movie in 2018 if Infinity War wouldn't released in the same year. Now, the outcome is great.Firstly, I do like the opening scene. It can be said that it's different from other MCU's films. New formula for the next phase, I think. Secondly, please someone give the person whose responsible for the choreography in this movie a lot of cookie. Black Panther isn't a martial art themed superhero but it nailed it. So much better than the choreography in the series of protector of K'un-Lun. Third, the humor. Back in the Ragnarok last year, Marvel served us an action-humor movie. Thus, my expectation is Black Panther will be not so different from Ragnarok. I can't said that this movie will not have any humour. It has precise portion of humour and I totally laughing out loud from its jokes. Last, the cast. Hands down for all the cast. Totally great job, especially you Andy Serkins.Closing statement. Black Panther is a beautiful superhero movie. The plot, the bgm, and of course the scenery. 9 of 10.P.S : There are two post-end credit scenes. Just wait. It's worth your time in the second scenes. Ciao."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,1/10,"Who paid someone to vote for this for the Oscars.
This movie could be really good if you have insomnia."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Due to the recent over saturation of the superhero genre, most of us have developed a fatigue to these movies by now and are tired of seeing the same old thing rehashed over and over again. 
This was my biggest concern walking into this movie, so I kept my expectations low even throughout all the praise that Black Panther has been getting. I didn't wanna see the same story for the 19th time. Well, may you rest at peace because Black Panther is NOT that, it's an exciting, fresh take on all the tropes that we are so bored of. I would even go as far to say that it may be the most memorable and highest quality film Marvel has produced since Civil War. Sure, Doctor Strange was visually cool, Guardians was okay, Spiderman was better than other Spidermans and Thor was fun, but Black Panther stands out from the crowd. For the most part, it solves my biggest problem that 99% of superhero films struggle with, which is pointless and weak villains. The movie starts off with (super minor spoilers?) it's secondary villain, who is a familiar and exciting character that I really enjoy seeing on screen - Ulysses Klaue. He's fun, energetic, crazy, unpredictable and cool. But later as the movie is developing, a new brand of Marvel villain emerges, Killmonger. He has everything that modern villains lack - moral dilemma, comprehensive motivation, solid plan. You understand him and you sympathise with his reasoning, understanding why he has to do what he's doing. It's not your typical pure overpowered evil forces from outer space here to conquer for no reason. It's a human who wants to fix the world and do something right, someone who believes that they are doing good. Also, I enjoyed that the conflict of the movie was scaled (for the most part) and we didn't see any ""world ending"" implications or over the top CGI laser spewing magic boss battles (that look more like a video game cutscene than a movie, I'm looking at you Justice League). Both Black Panther and Killmonger were equally matched. Nobody was overpowered. The stakes were set at the exact right level, which gives me really high hopes for the upcoming Avengers movie. I don't know if this movie necessarily will withstand the test of time but what I know for sure that I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's a great movie that could be watched as a stand-alone film outside of the MCU, that doesn't require previous knowledge of comic book lore. From a cinematic standpoint, I really enjoyed that this movie mashes so many of the familiar things that you know and love and puts them in one movie and NAILS it. It doesn't feel forced but you feel the genuine love and care that was there behind scenes. You can tell that this was a movie made by people who like movies. There are moments where it feels like it could be a scene from the universes like James Bond, Fast and the Furious, Lion King, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and a million other things and it feels good. It was an awesome and epic ride that made me feel like a kid again. Other than a few cheesy jokes that felt a little bit out of place √† la ""hey there fellow kids"", there is really nothing to nitpick. 
I have to applaud literally every single department that's worked on this movie - the cinematography, the special effects, the set design, costumes, music, sound design, acting, etc, all of it was top notch. Overal, fantastic watch that's worth going to the theatre for. 
Also, for those who are concerned that this is a liberal aimed progressive movie that's gonna shove ""social justice warrior"" things down your throat? You're just plain wrong. It doesn't feel forced at all, in fact, it felt more natural than a LOT of movies that are coming out these days.P/SBetter than Wonder Woman, which I also enjoyed."
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2018,4/10,"I don't watch much marvel movies or any super heroes movies, I used to liked them when they first started to become populars like the first X-men or the first Avenger. They were entertaining, funny and originals to a certain degree, they didn't reinvent the wheel of actions movies, but they pushed it to the limits. After a while though they became quite repetitive sometimes more than other, but with a movie every 6 months or so it's hard to follow without loosing interest. So this is where I stand, I enjoy action, I enjoy special effects, I enjoy Super heroes, but more than anything I like to be entertain.It's basically 2 stories, first it's a heist movie disguised as a spy movie disguised as a superhero movie, after that it's the classic Disney prince story of king loose his kingdom, has to fight for it, meet resistance.Sadly this movie wasn't quite entertaining sure it had pretty much all the check points of a big action movie... in fact any type of action movies: hand combat, sword fights, gun fights, army fights and space ships fights, car chase, spy gadgets, super heroes gadgets, casino meet up with the bad guys, illegal merchandise contraband, cia, spies, super soldiers, girl army, rhinoceros, etc. 
Problem was the delivery was off on most of them, there was a LOT of things going on, they tried to do everything, while also introducing a team of 4+1 people + their aunts and uncles, 2 bad guys, 2 other tribes chiefs. It makes at least 9 characters to introduce and create a personality for them with screen time and dialogues, it doesn't work and we end up with pretty unidimensional characters with no depth. There was nothing original outside of it being in a fictional Africa, costumes where amazing by the way (I'm not talking about black panther per say). Looking at some critics though I feel like it did absolutely what it needed to do, it realized the phantasms of most of the black audience. It was kind of a celebration of what any kid with some feeling of the weight of blacks oppressions over the years would like to happen to the black community. I think it really touch a sensible nerve with the black American community in that sense. For me it felt like just giving everything he wanted to the viewer. While being empowering in a sense it didn't gave much satisfaction cinematographically speaking.It didn't bring anything new on the table, no character offered much possibly to get attached to except maybe the bad guy. In the end it felt really flat and soulless everything looked quite clinical (that's what happen when you shoot everything in front of green screens) and most character had the depth of a page of paper. Unless you're a big super hero movie, stay away from this movie, it's a forgettable effort."
BLACK PANTHER,9 November 2018,10/10,"Yes it was! I read Black Panther comics as a child (1970's) and I knew that one day I would see it on screen. Seeing was not even the best gift. The best gift was not even being BG/Featured Extra. The best gift was when my children and Family/Friends spotted me in the movie at least 2 minutes before I did. Yes!!!This movie was everything I hoped for. Full of Action. Strong Ethnic collaborations. Beautiful wardrobe/costumes. Emotionally vulnerability for all the stars-starting with Dr. Chad Boseman. A wonderful working atmosphere and just a fun place to participate in a life-changing, cinema changing, movie-making work of art. Oh my Stars and Garters.It was so good that Black Panther 2 is an automatic Blockbuster hit making 2x the money made by the 1st. Hint: as of this writing the 2nd one is not even made yet.Black Panther is the reason why #iAmTheMoviemakingBusiness.#NufSed"
BLACK PANTHER,11 September 2018,4/10,"It is not garbage, but also its NOT the best super hero movie ever haha u kidding me ? .. the fact that this got an Oscar Nom and TDK didn't says EVERYTHING about the current social state of Hollywood.. We all know that political correctness has made these two movies (GET OUT) what they are right now .. But if your not a blind leftist , i know you will agree with me .. The movie is just OK , just that .. Entertaining and thats all .."
BLACK PANTHER,25 May 2018,9/10,"I've seen some terribly negative reviews so thought I'd write my two cents to counteract them. This movie is beautiful. I'm a Marvel fan, so I definitely have a greater appreciation of this film than someone who isn't, but I went with my friend who's never seen an action or superhero movie in her life and she really enjoyed it too. The acting is great; the villain is truly a sympathetic antagonist. His motives are clear. The film has quite a few unexpected twists that keep surprising you; there's enough comedy and a ton of color to make it fun. The protagonists are exceptional - you love them and feel them. The visuals are spectacular! The film is based in a hidden country that comes to life on screen. You can believe it's real; you want to believe it's real. The creators of this film have created an entire new culture with such depth, showing off its tradition and color in so many different ways. 
At the same time, it's not too surreal (except for the nearly-magical and incredibly diverse Vibranium technology, which is kind of the whole point). A good part of the movie takes place in modern urban locales, adding a whole different vibe. The action is fantastic. Different characters have their own style, strengths, and weaknesses. Every movement made sense."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Finally the first the major release of 2018 is here in the form of Marvel Studios' Black Panther, which is the first comic-book movie based on a colored superhero. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler, this is a bold and mostly fresh take on the superhero genre. With all the hype being built around the movie, you may be asking, does it live up to it? The answer is, mostly. The events of Black Panther take place shortly after ""Captain America: Civil War"", where T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to Wakanda to become the new king after the unfortunate death of his father. But the problem is that T'Challa doesn't believe that he is ready to follow in his father's footsteps and be as great of a leader as him, which creates some conflict within himself. This conflict and self-doubt however, must be put aside when a mercenary named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) threatens to sell Wakanda's secret resource, vibranium, on the black market. T'Challa also has to deal with someone by the name of Erik Stevens aka Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who has a surprising backstory that gives some depth to the character, which actually makes him a decent villain overall. Unlike most comic-book movies with multiple villains, this one handles them really well and never lets them make the story too convoluted, which can be credited to the writing by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole. This is by far one of the most mature Marvel movies ever made and part of that is because of the performances by a talented cast that has a mix of veterans and newcomers. Boseman holds his own as T'Challa, Michael B. Jordan is solid as the main villain, and even Forest Whitaker brings something to the table as Zuri, one of the elders of Wakanda. The scene stealer here however is Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's sister, Shuri, who is basically the brains behind all of the advanced medical and warfare equipment that Wakanda has. It helps that she and Boseman have good chemistry with one another, making the brother and sister relationship that they have in the movie believable. What also makes this movie more mature than other Marvel films is the themes that it touches on. Some of the themes include racial, moral, and political issues that really make this movie seem a bit less like a typical action-packed superhero movie. The action scenes that are present in the movie are fine and exactly what you would expect, but the emphasis here is on the characters and themes.Even though it is a more mature piece of work when compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it still has that same formulaic and predictable plot that plagues almost every superhero movie these days, especially the Marvel ones. It even got to the point where towards the final act of the movie, I predicted exactly how everything was going to play out and sure enough, I was right. It's just your typical rise, fall, and rise again storyline that features a hero of some sort. But perhaps this is the problem with solo superhero movies that are set in cinematic universes, you already know which characters can and can't die, and this leads to the movies having the same predictable plot line that we've seen over and over again, and Black Panther is no exception. It's the only real major weakness of the film, but it's a big one.All in all, Black Panther delivers an origin story that is more grounded in its characters and themes compared to most other comic-book movies, which was definitely something refreshing to experience. It's not this masterpiece that many claim it to be, but if you can get past its formulaic and predictable plot, you may find yourself smiling throughout this journey all the way up until Infinity War in May."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,1/10,If you are going to be entertained you will be disappointed. This movie started out with promise and got worse. Don't waste your time or money.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"I liked this film. The action looked nice, better than the action in Thor: The Dark World and in Ant-Man. The acting was pretty good, it really seemed like the actors cared. 
But the main problem is that this is meant to be an origin story but it really doesn't feel like it, we still don't know a lot about Black Panther and HOW he got his suit. 
I still don't feel like all of the hype is justified, but it's not as bad as Thor: The Dark World. 
The villain is not as good as people say he is, he is not that intimidating which most of the GOOD Marvel villains are. Loki was threatening and funny, he was not. 
It feels like your average Marvel movie, and that's ok! 
If you like Marvel, watch it. You'll like it. 
But don't be close minded enough to think that this is good just because it has black people in a non-racist way. If you want black people in that sort of scenario watch: The Incredibles (Frozone is a side character but super funny!), Pulp Fiction (SLJ was amazing!), Moonlight (wonderful LGBTQ movie!), The Dark Knight Trilogy (Morgan Freeman is wonderful), and so many more! Don't let this average movie blind your criticism of black people, positive or negative."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,7/10,"You have to be suspicious of any movie that sets out to deliberately break new ground. ""Wonder Woman,"" for example, was a pretty good movie but had some flaws. It got a pass from critics because it was the first woman superhero movie. Had it stared Chris Hemsworth or Tom Cruise, it would have been treated much more harshly.""Black Panther"" does a fabulous job of building a super advanced civilization in the heart of Africa. The depth, complexity and thought that went into all of this was truly delightful. Too bad it could not have been explored in a ""Game of Thrones"" style long-format story ark. As it was, we spend almost half the movie world-building for a disappointingly small payoff in terms of story. The middle drags while so much track is being laid.The story is OK. ""Iron Man"", by way of comparison, was a great movie because of the main character's growth ark. We saw an immature and deeply flawed Tony Stark come into true adulthood. He emerges from the shadow of his father and faces the truth about the deadly weapons he creates. In ""Black Panther"" we see T'Challa also emerge into true adulthood. He starts as an admirable and nearly perfect Prince and develops into an admirable and slightly more perfect King. The growth ark is interesting but underwhelming.The truly fascinating character is Killmonger (Michael Jordan) and his sidekick Claw (Andy Serkis). We end up wishing more of the movie had been about them rather than T'Challa's angst over whether to be just noble or really really noble. Still, definitely worth seeing. The creative detail and near total immersion into alternative African culture makes up for the lackluster character development and predictable story."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,7/10,"Admittedly I wasn't able to see this film on opening weekend, yet that didn't matter at all because everyone else did. The movie grossed over 200 million dollars on it's opening weekend, becoming only the fifth movie in history to do so. But is the movie really worth all the high praise? A 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 88 on Metacritic? Well the movie is not perfect at all but it is absolutely worth the price of admission. First of all the acting is not 100% solid, Chadwick Boseman is good but a bit bland and uninspired in the leading role. The rest of the supporting cast is serviceable but the standouts by far are Letitia Wright (Shuri), Andy Serkis (Klaue) and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger). These performances are dynamic, electric and charismatic and are truly the best parts of the film. Michael B. Jordan gives us the most charismatic performance any MCU has ever had while delivering the most memorable and complex Marvel villain to date. I'ts a shame that he's only in about 20 minutes of the actual movie since he is one if not the best part of the film. The visual color palette in this film is amazing and yes I am talking about a Marvel film (lol). The film's cinematography and color is very pleasing to the eyes as Marvel has taken the complaints of their previous films to heart. Ryan Coogler, the director, did a great job with this film and continues to impress me at such a young age. By 31 he's already wowed me with his meticulous direction in Fruitvale Station, he's inspired me to actually get off my couch for once with Creed and now has delivered a really fun MCU film. However not all is sunshine in Wakanda as the visual effects leave much to be desired. For a Marvel flick with a budget of 200 million dollars some of the effects are plainly put, unacceptable. The uncanny valley is way too noticeable on several times during the run-time this unfortunately breaks the level of immersion and enjoyment. No spoilers, but there is a scene during the third act of the film in which I just lost it. The effects were so laughably bad, during the scene, that I just couldn't maintain my composure. I was put under the scrutiny of the whole theater as they turned towards me to try and comprehend why somebody would laugh at the climax of a film. This reaction makes me think that most people won't have a problem with the CGI this time around. Although in reality the scene looks as if it was a video game cut-scene taken right out of the Playstation 2. Regardless I think this film is worth a watch just don't expect to walk into the 12 Angry Men or the Citizen Kane of Marvel films. Curb your expectations and be ready for a flawed yet awesome good time at the cinema. 
Final Score: 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,3/10,This movie is completely generic and the dialogue and script often times make not a lick of sense. Killmonger is not an interesting villain. He is in literally 4 or 5 scenes. The humor is somehow even worse than what Marvel typically churns out with each new release. It's funny people claim this movie to be bold and refreshing when it's really not.
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2018,10/10,"I'm sorry I oppressed you? My family hadn't even immigrated yet, but I'm white. Thanks for the hate Marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"A great addition to the MCU. Great acting, beautiful visuals and some intense action. First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"I don't understand why people are giving this movie bad reviews on here. I guess some people can't handle an all black cast. Anyway, this movie is filled with action and greatness. The actors are beautiful. The acting is more then on point. The messages hidden messages are wonderful This is just an all around wonderful movie."
BLACK PANTHER,4 February 2021,6/10,"Decent storyline, great special effects, fun to have as part of the MCU. But the writers getting in their little ""white people bad"" pot shots every chance they get really gets a bit tiresome and causes some eyerolls."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,4/10,"I understand the cultural importance of this movie. I really do. I know why there are so many people so excited about it. BUT, looking at it from my perspective? It's just not that great of a movie. The acting was bad. The script was disappointing. Visually, yes, stunning. Interesting to see the African imagery and cultural ideas woven in. It makes statements about colonialism, US foreign policy, slavery, etc, etc, basically all the social justice issues that Black Lives Matter discusses. But it doesn't make the statements well. I feel bad in saying that the person who I thought put in the best performance was Martin Freeman...a white guy. So, despite the fact that I know this is an important movie, and I want to tell people to watch it because of that...I can't. I just didn't think it was a very good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,8/10,"What can I say about this movie?!It was just amazing.It shows a super tech Africa and the war inside it.The special effects and the elements of science fiction like: costumes,cars or weapons were great.And this tech part is mixed with the old and traditon(you can see it in the clothes they were wearing).Also the cast was very good(Oscar Nominne Daniel Kaluuya, the star Chadwick Boseman and the other actors)The personages were brave,sometimes funny and with a lot of charisma.I hope they make the other Black Panther movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,5/10,"I went into this film excited, wanting to support this for all the obvious reasons. It certainly had the potential to be great. But, I was underwhelmed and I was honestly bored. It is not a BAD film but it's just not that great. The acting is mediocre and the dialogue is cringeworthy. I lost interest about a third of the way through.Michael Jordan is the saving grace - but he would be phenomenal in anything."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,8/10,"Okay so I just saw Black Panther yesterday and I was a tad bit disappointed first of all Tchalla in the Black Panther suit is only in the movie for probably 30 min at the most, which was fine but I'm just saying. Also I found it a little offensive even though I'm not a African the Erik Killmonger (Michael B Jordan) said that Africans on the street have been suffering for years, but the people who actually live in Africa have been suffering for much longer, it didn't bother me that much but before a race or political statement really think about what your saying.But really that was the only bad the rest was good Chadwick as Tchalla was great same with Michael B Jordan as Erik. The special effects looked great and it also had a pretty ok story for a starting superhero movie over all I'll give it a 8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,4 December 2019,9/10,"Even though most of the soundtracks songs don't appear in the film, it's still an amazing experience! definitely one of the best films of 2018! The people at marvel studios did a good job producing this movie"
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,2/10,"But bad, a low point for Marvel/Disney. So sad..Weak character origin, weak main actor, was there a script?"
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,6/10,"'Black Panther' is being praised as ""Marvel's masterpiece"", but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. The film's first act is enjoyable, where we are told the origin of the African nation of Wakanda and introduced to the main characters. Sadly though, the second act felt drawn-out and kind of boring, and the film never seems to regain it's momentum after that. The scenery is beautiful and it is very well-shot. Wakanda is easily one of the coolest and most vibrant locations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I can't wait to see more of it in May's 'Avengers: Infinity War' (YAY!!!). Some of the acting was terrific, particularly Black Panther's sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), the film's primary villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan), and secondary villain Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). Shuri and Klaue served as the film's comic relief, and their humor was refreshing and on-point. Killmonger is definitely one of Marvel's best villains to date. He was intimidating and captivating to watch. Unfortunately, Black Panther himself (Chadwick Boseman) didn't seem to show much emotion and struck me as very monotonous. The action scenes were pretty cool, but some of them were too dark and I didn't always know who was who, which made them hard to follow. The end fight between Black Panther and Killmonger felt very CGI-heavy, which took away from the enjoyment. Although I like the design of Black Panther's new suit more than his first suit from 'Captain America: Civil War', it looked too cartoony for my taste. It was even more unfortunate that Killmonger had the exact same type of suit with a different design. Overall, 'Black Panther' was good, but fell short of great."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,,"Never seen such a load of crap for a long time, badly acted silly accents, A PC film and it shows.There are many very good Black actors, Denzil Washington, Cuba Gooding,Whoopi Goldberg, Morgan Freeman etc etc they dont need a load of rubbish like this to help."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,Too long and boring. The people I went with fell asleep.
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2018,6/10,It's an ok movie. Way too much hype. The Black Panther seemed a lot weaker in this than in Civil War.
BLACK PANTHER,10 January 2019,2/10,I like black panther but the movie sucked. I tried to watch the movie but it was real hard not to fall asleep.
BLACK PANTHER,26 January 2019,2/10,I watched it on Netflix. Wow this was hard to watch without falling asleep. Didn't bother finishing it. I really wanted to like this movie.
BLACK PANTHER,29 December 2018,3/10,"It's my first time writing a review here.
I was with high expectations only to find out the movie is so flat and plain.
The characters and plot are so weak - it doesn't explain what happens to W'Kabi afterwards - no slight elaboration or explanation on his thoughts and actions before and after; all of a sudden the Black Panther won Erik when he was sooo weak and fragile in previous parts, etc.
So little background on everyone throughout the entire movie. All characters are for sure wasted.
It surprises me the average score can reach 7.4.
Don't rush just because the timeline is tight please Marvel Studio."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"Wow, haven't seen something like this in many years, this is really refreshing and enjoyable and eye-catching to watch. It's really out of this world, though events of course happened on this earth. The cinematography is awesome, and it felt like a mish-mesh of star wars, avatar and lord of the rings. Acts of chivalry abounds like LOTR."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"I do not understand the hype about this movie. It is made by competent people who know their craft and know how to elevate an average screenplay to a visual spectacle. Strip away the CGI and what have you got left? Well a standard script that works in Hollywood. Hero becomes king after tragic loss, hero is brave and honest, hero is immensely rich and then it is time for the fall and then of course he gets back on his horse and wins the day and gets the girl. The formula works with a twist here and there but nothing to testing. And it ends like other Hollywood dreams no matter how advanced and technically savvy the world they created is, it always ends up with a fist fight. 
It is not as comedic or refreshing as Deadpool or Guardians Vol1, it is better then Iron Man or most of the other MCU productions. It lacks a spirited hero, this one is bland at best. It has no awesome bad guy with great one liners. it features no memorable characters. Some good actors are here Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis but King Lear it is not. It is a comic book made into a movie and it has no deeper meaning then that. It will kill 2 hours and you won't get bored, a second or even a 3rd watch is a waste time."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2019,10/10,Black Panther is amazing movie that is really worth it. I believe it is one of the best movies in the Marvel cinematic universe it creates a new location that is amazing. The female characters are strong and powerful at the acting is incredible. The costume design is beautiful and the technology is amazing this film. Hopefully this creates a new era of African-American focus sci-fi. I think it is essential that you built you this film. It's one of the best superhero movies that Marvel has ever produced after Capt. Marvel of course. In the end this movies amazing and I believe everyone should see it shows in the future can be bright if we embrace everyone. I love this movie and I believe it is an instant classic that people will be talking about for decades.
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2019,7/10,"So many reviews here with 1 star, and the majority of them specify it's dull, dry and only rated highly because of the political reasons.On the other hand, many critics have gone a bit too mad in saying it's one of the greatest movies of all time with it being the first black superhero movie etc.
But overall I'd call it a solid addition to the MCU, being something a little different, and setting up Avengers: Infinity War very nicely.
The feel and atmosphere of the film was different to what we'd experienced before in the MCU, assisted nicely by a great score by Ludwig G√∂ransson, and originals by Kendrick Lamar.One major criticism I have is the execution of the climax scene as T'Challa and Killmonger face off and Killmonger is defeated but other than that there are some fantasticly directed, one being the car chase, or perhaps the two scenes where T'Challa is challenged, specifically the Killmonger challenge.And on Killmonger, he's one of my favourite villians in the MCU. Michael B. Jordan did a brilliant job there.People who think it's dull are probably just watching the wrong film.
There are different genres in the MCU, for example The Winter Soldier is a Spy kind of movie, whereas Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok are more like Fantasy and Comedy, and different people like different genres.People who complain about it being too politicaly correct are just morons. This film (along with the entire MCU) is based on the comics, and Kevin Feige wanted to introduce Black Panther just before Avengers: Infinity War, so that the setting for Wakanda was ready to play a prominent part in the film. And for this to happen, a lot of the cast has to be black. They can't make it without the cast being black, they're basically forced to include them. So there's no way it was made just for political correctness and what not.Anyway Black Panther was a very good film, and I'd probably give it a 7.7/7.8 kind of rating which rounds up to 8 for this."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2021,3/10,"Positive reviews for this are obviously political nonsense from liberal PC powderpuffs. Everyone is so scared to say a ""black"" movie is awful. And this one certainly was. Had good parts, but was clearly made to drive a wedge between the races. Not sure how things will get better if we keep showcasing one colour over the other."
BLACK PANTHER,20 October 2020,1/10,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
Admittedly, I am not a super hero fan at all. I don't get into the whole Marvel thing. I do love the Christopher Nolan Batman's, which is what I was told this film would be.
Far from it.
The dialogue was below average, there were only a couple of decent performances. The story line was predictable. The action scenes were dull.
It was a total waste of my time and money.If you like marvel films, then I imagine you'd like this movie.
If you're like me, don't get caught up in the hype. Steer clear of this one."
BLACK PANTHER,5 October 2018,6/10,"I'm a huge marvel fan and enjoyed the movie but it's towards the bottom of all the marvels. The story and action are a little slow but not dreadful.To me it's pretty obvious critics were so enamored by the diversity of the movie they gave it underserving high scores. I guess this is how it is now, the black community does a decent movie and the liberals boost it show how racist they aren't...sad"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"Warning: It contains very minor spoilers.I so wanted this film to be as good as the reviews said it was, I really did. Black Panther is one of my favorite characters from the comics and I couldn't wait to see it's solo film after the great debut of the character in Captain America: Civil War. Boy, was I in for a disappointment!Where do I start? Well, the storyline was old, totally predictable (I've seen it done before and better), and parts of it didn't make sense, at all. Even though the movie is more than two hours long, the story feels too short. Maybe it's because the writers made it so political, it felt the film was trying too hard to pass a political message the whole time, instead of just trying to tell a good story about a great character. The truth is, when I watch a superhero movie, I don't want to be preached at, I want to see a good story and the hero kick ass. If I want to watch a socially relevant movie, I'll watch Amistad or Selma, not Black Panther.The visuals of the film were gorgeous - the photography was beautifully done, the sets were awsome and the costumes looked great. But without a good story and strong characters, all that means nothing. Which brings me to the characters: the main character comes out very weak, I didn't care much for him and that's a big problem when we're talking about the hero of the film! I don't think it was Chadwick Boseman's fault, since I liked him in Captain America: Civil War, I think the problem was the screenplay and the way they wrote the character. He did the best he could with what he had, but it just wasn't enough.
Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are just about the best thing in this film, they play two gorgeous and very strong women - two great actresses with a bright future ahead of them (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's simply one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and with such an amazing talent!). Letitia Wright played the hero's younger sister Shuri, and she's a good actress, but the way they wrote her character made her annoying at times instead of the comic relief she was suposed to be.
As for the villain, well it's simply one of the dullest and most uninteresting villain in movie history. And it didn't help that Michael B. Jordan played him that way too. Totally forgetable. The one good thing in this film villain wise was Andy Serkis - he had a blast playing Klaue and you could see it. Too bad he was criminally underused.
Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett were their usual very good selfs, and Martin Freeman played with a perfect american accent a CIA agent that turned out to be an otherwise completely useless character.The action sequences were good, although Marvel as given us better before. The CGI is overall good, although some scenes are a bit blured. The direction is sloppy at times, but overall competent.All in all, it's your average Marvel film: it looks good, it entertains, but it lacks depth and suffers from a major shortage of good story and good characters, so you forget it as soon as you leave the theater. My sugestion? Save your money for Avengers: Infinity War (fingers crossed that it'll be epic!) and wait for this one to come to Netflix."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"As a Marvel fan I expected this movie to delve into the details of where the vibranium came from, why it has special properties, the origin of the Black Panther, and whether the Soul Stone was in Wakanda or not. But they didn't go in that direction. Instead they focused on character development. Which is great. That is what most superhero movies lack. All the characters experience growth and change their beliefs as the story advances. With that said, the story is generic, just like most other Marvel movies. The villain's motivations are not explored enough to really care about him and the story is very predictable. All in all, it's a good movie. Overhyped but stil great."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2019,4/10,It is sad that political people add hype to a movie. Why can't we just enjoy a movie without someone trying to brainwash us?
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,6/10,"Rotten tomato 97% ? I can't believe this. This movie should have a potential to reach 8.5 at rating, but nah. The concept is terrific, there are so much things that I wanna know about wakanda, their diversity is really interesting, the concept that an african country who hide themselves from world and have the most advanced tech is really blow my mind.
But we have to admit its a quite boring movie. We should know who would win the fight before the fight begin and who's come back to life, thats a problem. Its a really typical superhero movie which marvel not showed to us in thor and civil war (which is great).
The joke had a lot of miss. The character is like just being made 2 minutes ago, even the main villain is not have a clear and builded character. We don't feel anything for the villain even his father is being killed by his uncle and he want to provide high tech for the better world. Suddenly the main vilain is ex american military personel with great skill and this goes nowhere, just mentioned once.When the world start erasing the racism by giving them easiness, then it should be a disgrace to themselves. Just treat everyone the same way."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,2/10,"Super over-hyped in the press (just because its a movie mainly with non-white people, that barely touch on subjects such as immigration and isolationism vs. globalisation - ooh, how deep!)The actors performed really well, they did the best they could with what was given to them. I blame the story writers who wrote up an attempt at substance and completely side stepped action (in the whole movie, you only see 2 action scenes including the Black Panther (in character), for the rest its just filler and ""drama"")The antagonist appears out of nowhere and takes the throne he deserves, by winning all too easily in a non-super fight. To this T'challa thinks he is right to claim revenge and take his throne back .. even though he lost it fair and square (true, he neither died or surrendered, but he did black out and lost). But hey, apparently getting rid of 'the' immigrant seems to supersede honor. Am I the only one who noticed the parallel between the antagonist's plan of arming the globally disenfranchised with weapons and US foreign policy for these past many decades? Yet this seems to be a good enough reason for wanting him off the throne. That and he's a foreigner (something 'disturbing' enough that the Jabari tribe decide to come down from their mountains in order to help Black Panther).
I don't think the movie sends out the right messages.Great potential but none of it was tapped, at all. Complete waste of time. The movie marks a clear difference in direction from previous Marvel movies which were more about bringing the Comics experience to the screen than this sad attempt at story building."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,9/10,Why did Kilmomger have to die?!?!! Only reason I took a star away.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,6/10,"Look, I stopped watching about half the DC comic TV shows (ESPECIALLY Supergirl) because I am tired of being preached to.
The victim mentality is WAY too over the top.
This movie was beautifully done with great cinematography.
The story was...meh with predictable plot (tho Gorilla man proving to be a class act was a surprise and a real bonus) with lots of scenes that I saw as...why?
Acting was melodramatic and trite.
But what ruined it the most was the regular victim mentality theme that has just turned me off to most of Hollyweird and the media in general.
Up until now Marvel has taken the high road with this but they have dipped their toe into the politically correct cesspool that is losing Hollyweird millions of fans and dollars.
This movie so far has been financially successful but I think it will be a niche viewership and its real success is that it had little real competition.
Seriously Stan, you allowed this?"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,6/10,"Ther's a lot going for this film. The whole story challenges the common protectionist and nationalistic narrative that's growing in our Trump-mongering days. It questions America's policies of foreign intervention. And it give African Americans their long-awaited place as the bad-asses of Hollywood. But despite all those wonderful things... at the end of the day, it's just a superhero movie. I'd be surprised if anyone really cares about it in 20 years."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"Had its moments, and was enjoyable, but they hype train derails pretty quick.
I did like how the story was about Black Panther, and his origin as king, not really about him becoming BP (he was already that in Civil War). There were lots of people saying things like ""breaks the Marvel mold"" This is a brave new direction for superhero films"".
It doesn't and its not. The only one that has changed the mold was Winter Soldier, a movie that was a spy thriller first and a super hero movie second, but we are not talking about that movie here.
The acting in the movie, for the most part, is fine. Some actors really did need to step up their game, but they didn't get too much time wasted on them.The villain, though better with his motives, was just as forgettable as the rest of the villains in this franchise.If you are a marvel fan, yes you will like it, if you are a super hero fan, yes you will like it....will you need to come back and see it again...well I don't, but hey maybe they hype worked on you...."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars a phenomonel cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!
Final Rating 9/10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,6/10,I can't believe this pile was just nominated for best picture! This was a bad movie beginning to end. Props on the cast though.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Marvel's Black Panther is one of those movies that's a game changer for the Black community. It is the first-ever comic superhero movie that features a black person as the lead role (not counting Hancock, as that was not based off a comic book). It features a predominately black cast, and was directed by a black man, Ryan Coogler. It breaks some media stereotypes about black people, and it's really something. If you haven't seen it, you should ASAP. It is simply breathtaking, especially in 3D. The movie might be one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's going to be hard to top this."
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2018,10/10,A very very avesome movie. Black Panther is such a good character.
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,6/10,"The movie itself is fine, well-made, but nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel fans will love this one, since Black Panther is a well-developed character. Plus, the villain got more personal screen time, so for me it's one of the best villain of the MCU made thus far.The overload of jokes was toned down for this movie, which i think its a really good for two reasons: It fits the moral of the story, and previous marvel movies were full-on comedies, with not so great humor. So Marvel fan will have a blast, and im sure this movie will pick a large audience, not only Marvel Fans. It's a great action flick, with a great soundtrack too ! It's just not different from what you have already seen. It's good, go see it if you are interested, otherwise I don't think you will enjoy it, and will be rather disapointed with all the good reviews its getting (87/100 on metacritic). I enjoyed it more than previous and recent Marvel movies, but I dont think it's the best marvel movie at all (like the praise its getting)."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,10/10,"Eish wow oh wow gawdammit wow again. Black Panther is a superlatively phenomenonal & brilliant movie. I was blown away. Black Panther is more than a movie,it's a MOVEMENT,it's an IDEA,it's a CONCEPT of how GREAT AFrica ergo Africans can be. I was teary eyed watching BP thinking how good it feels to be represented on the BIG SCREEN by people who look & talk like me. For the first time AFRICA was shown in a glorious light as leaders in technology & humanity. Yep I'm so made up for this film Imma name my twin sons T'Chaka & T'Chala or my twin daughters Nakia & Okoye or Shuri someday. If you haven't seen BP please do so today!"
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,5/10,"I really don't get the big hype for this movie..... it looked to be ok in the trailer, other than the corny sister, but it wasn't something i would watch again.... Pretty much what I had predicted"
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2021,3/10,This is the most overrated movie of all time and the fact that this was nominated for best picture and The Dark Knight wasn't is a crime against humanity.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"Like many people, I enjoyed comics as a child (I still do). However, being black, most of the characters I saw didn't look like me. Of course, I didn't really think about that until I was older. About that same time, I realized that the same racial disparity seen in comics exists in Hollywood, as well. Thus, I was intrigued by the notion of a Black Panther movie.I wasn't going to see it in theaters, but I did a little digging to learn what the movie was about and it intrigued me, so I saw it during opening weekend. Since it's a comic book movie, I was apprehensive. They're typically enjoyable but have shallow plotlines. Well, this movie managed to impress me. No easy feat. Why did it impress me? Because Ryan Coogler managed to incorporate everyday social issues into the movie. Most comic book movies deal with some supernatural issue. While that's fine, most of us probably can't identify with fighting aliens or other superpowered beings. Before walking into the theater, I knew that Wakanda was supposed to be a technologically advanced country in Africa. A possibility of what African nations could be if they hadn't suffered the effects of colonization. So, I came in with a question. If Wakandans are so advanced, what are they doing to help their neighbors? I didn't actually expect the movie to address this question. Surprisingly, it did. When T'Challa considered breaking from tradition and sharing Wakanda's resources with others and admitting refugees into the country, one of his friends closed the matter by saying that refugees would bring their problems and make Wakanda just like any other country.The villain of the movie turns out to be T'Challa's cousin. He believes that Wakanda should use its resources to arm the oppressed and help them defeat their oppressors. After a big battle, T'Challa decides that his cousin had a point about helping others rather than keeping the wealth to oneself, albeit he is less militant in his views. So, the movie ends with him pledging Wankandan aid to other countries during a meeting with the UN. It's an ending that I admired. So often, people are faced with the decision of helping others and we don't because we may not have as much as we once did afterwards. While Black Panther is a work of fiction, perhaps it will inspire people to pursue a more altruistic approach to life.One of the things that I admired most about the movie was its casting choices. I hate to say it, but Hollywood has a tendency to cast white actors in minority roles. Thus, I was happy to see a predominantly black cast in a movie that's not one of Tyler Perry's. Not only that, but 4 of the characters we consistently see are women. Wakanda seems to be a society that views women as being just as competent as men. For instance, the royal guard is completely made up of women. It feels rare for me to see black women in roles that aren't tossed aside for the sake of a white character. Here, we see a quartet of women who act as T'Challa's closest advisors: a tech genius, a queen, a spy, and the head of his guard. I'd say that that they serve as examples of how black women can succeed in the world (if given the chance).My only real qualm with this movie is the villain, Erik Killmonger. As I said, he presents a foible to T'Challa's pacifism. I'm fine with that. It actually reminded me of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Two men who have similar goals but different methods of obtaining said goals. I could sympathize with Killmonger right up until he killed and threatened people who were hesitant to do what he said. What's the point of lifting other Africans up if you're needlessly killing your own people to do it? Without this character trait, I would've still viewed him as misguided, but I could still respect his position and how he came to have it. However, being a sociopathic murderer made him look like every other bad guy I see in Hollywood. I don't even think Killmonger needed to be a villain. He could have simply served as the flip side of the coin on this debate over whether or not Wakanda should aid other nations. Then again, there probably would've been less action and this IS a comic book movie. Oh well.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you're a comic book fan, I'd suggest seeing Black Panther. It deviates from the typical comic book formula of fight some aliens, blow stuff up, and end the movie without actually doing or saying anything important. I think Panther does have something to say. It shows us a representation that defies the Western expectations of what an African country looks like. Even more important, Black Panther demonstrates altruistic behavior that we can aspire to as human beings. Give it a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2019,7/10,"Does it have the aspects of all great Marvel movies? Yes. It has the stunning visuals, amazing CGI, near-perfect soundtrack, and a well put together cast.Is it the best Marvel movie ever? No. It took 18 movies for Marvel to set up the MCU to get to a point to actually make this. If they had tried to make it in Phase 2 or 3 of the Infinity Saga (aka after The Avengers or Avengers: Age of Ultron), it may not have been the success it was. Black Panther, although a key Avengers member, is not necessarily the most well known comic character.Like the rest, it does have flaws. Some of which are major. Killmonger is a little too over-zealous to make him supportable. Some characters aren't developed enough, even though they do show up in Infinity War later on. And the flashback scenes don't explain enough.It probably got a little over-hyped because it was the first minority superhero blockbuster (although Wesley Snipes' Blade trilogy was the first minority Marvel hero film). Marvel is working on a more diverse, inclusive film slate, which will bring about a new era. And may get those who aren't ""nerds"" into the theaters."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,2/10,"The movie is too politically motivated, it showcases a shangri la like fantasy for the africans. The entire plot is ""what if blacks had technology"" and ""what if blacks had remained un-colonized and profited from their own natural resources"". The entire movie plot revolves around these ""What if""s. There is no other substance. The love story between the main character and the female lead is pushed, rushed and disappointing. The movie has NO good actors, all dialogue is delivered in a stammering tone, monotone and robotic. The movie lacks DIVERSITY, there are maybe 2 white actors in the movie, no asians, no south asians, and showcases NO members of the LGBT community, partly because the ""audience"" or community this movie is geared towards is Homophobic.The movie tries to escape stereotypes but ironically manages to stand true to them all. Black man killing his family, black man abandoning a child, black man killing his own cousins for money or power, black man forcing himself on a woman, the list goes on. The only part i liked was the animation. The movie is garbage and i recommend you stay away from it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,6/10,"This was obviously a ""decent"" to pretty cool movie. This hype that influenced me to drop 60$ to watch it at the theatres, SMH, def not worth it. I when I say 60$ it's not just tix it's tix plus popcorn ect ......the movie was ok at best, this hype is unbelieveable! One of my co-workers said it was better than DEADPOOL!!!! OMG! Not even close! I feel deceived!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,1/10,"Maybe the worst film I've ever seen. I'm not going to waste much time unpacking the juvenile plot except to say that much of the dialog dripped with sarcasm and contempt for the ""white race"" who were referred to as ""colonizers"" and ""oppressors"" which had stole Africa's rich historical culture and art while profiting from it. Even the villian, who wanted to use his country's superior technology to destroy evil western civilization, was really just a young misunderstood ""freedom fighter"" trying to set things right. As others have mentioned, I go to the movies for escape from modern American politics, only to find I have paid to be preached to and insulted for 90 minutes. 
 I suppose the second problem and probably the greater problem is the film was boring. The young man why portrayed Black Panther is a good actor and I have admired his work in other films on Netflix so this is nothing against him but there was so many problems with this thing, not even his genius could save it."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,3/10,"You need a strong story to carry a film, not CGI. These actors deserved better. I walked out after 45 minutes."
BLACK PANTHER,11 July 2019,9/10,"""After the brief but strong performance of Black Panther during the outstanding Captain America: Civil War, MCU scheduled the right steps to build-up this African-beloved world which has all the potential to become a great franchise, just as Nolan's The Dark Knight""Spider-Man and Black Panther were gigantic surprises because, after a decade, one superhero could join the MCU and the other gave a new perspective of the African Continent which was something genuinely innovative. What makes the film so special (taking into account the prestigious cast, the well-developed villain, the beautiful imagery, and many other qualities) is the mixture of cultures, never leaving the influence the environment had within it. The film innovates the superhero world after a decade of US and UK origin storyline, finally, we can afford to do so in a spectacular way, I swear this will be an iconic origin story to a bunch of new-generation flicks. Practically, I took off my hat after watching it because it signified two positive points: a) Marvel golden years are still there (since 2016 Captain America: Civil War) and, b) The film brings back forgotten characters of the MCU and moulds their appearance while expanding their complexity (take the example of Ulysses Klaue, haven't heard of that folk since 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron). When stating the performances, everyone plays a key role and does it perfectly, my personal favourites were the main villain Killmonger, who turned out to be the third best villain I have seen in the MCU; Shuri, who is an exceptionally-awesome sister, and Nakia performed by the fisrt-class-talented Lupita. Finally, but not least, there is so much going on! For example, the action pieces entertain the audience as long as you could imagine, because they are set and dynamically prepared, then, the characters' development, it constructs Killmonger's profile and builts it, in order to present a final setup.It is difficult to find some defects, nevertheless, I considered the CGI a little exaggerated, while the comedy side was lacking a little bit... (85/100)"
BLACK PANTHER,27 October 2019,1/10,"This movie is bad. It got all the praise and even Oscar's (which it did not deserve) based off it's political statement. I'm glad people found empowerment in this movie. But it is not good, but it seems immune to criticism. It isn't good. The visuals look terrible, one fight scene looks like an early Xbox360 game. Bad bad bad."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,9/10,"This movie is one of the first heroes movie or i'm sad for the vilain to die, there isn't any victory out there this is just a tragedy where action is not the main show on this film. It's really deep with the ancestor stuff . I'm disapointed by the lack of the personality of the hero, it would deservea morie develloped character, he is kinda weak here , maybe to humble, but for me i prefer the vilain and the lab girl of course i awesome of freshness and so funny "" what are thoses ! ""well there is movie i'm like i enjoy a good moment like thor, but this one is kinda memorable, not because of the black actors but great actors , the colours and VO accents are great. They played with clichey but i think like that because i'm not from that africa culture. It's sound a tribute to it. Appart of action and the character, Black panther deserve a second movie out of wakanda before this MCU will end !"
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,7/10,"As a big fan of Marvel movies, I had been patiently awaiting Black Panther's release for several months. I finally got the chance to watch it this week, and I was honestly a bit disappointed. While the movie was entertaining, it was not extraordinary. First, the plot was quite predictable and cliche - an unsurprising story of revenge and political strife. Second, I felt that the character development overall was weak, particularly that of the villain. While the movie addressed the villain's motive for revenge against T'Challa, it barely explained why he thought Wakanda should change their political system. I honestly just couldn't connect to his character because it wasn't believable enough. Third, the movie relied much too heavily on cuts, and it had many poorly lit scenes that were basically impossible to see.On the plus side, Black Panther had a fairly strong cast. I was impressed with their performances, particularly that of Danai Gurira. In addition, the costumes and setting were beautifully executed - more so than the average Marvel movie. Overall, I'd still recommend Marvel fans see this movie, but don't set your expectations too high."
BLACK PANTHER,8 June 2018,6/10,"Not so good mybe, but as intermission and explanation before Infinity War is ok."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"It was hard for there to be stakes in Black Panther because the Avengers Infinity War trailer exists. As a viewer you know that the film will ultimately end with T'Challa alive and the country of Wikanda in a good situation because that's exactly what the Infinity War trailer shows. The film does offer good and enthusiastic performances from its cast most notably for me Andy Serkis' Klaue and also showcases the interesting culture of Wikanda but it does suffer from formulaic Marvel trends such as reluctance to kill off major characters and weak villians. While the film does focus on the themes of international relations between countries and racism its attempts to get the audience to think about these matters feel forced and sometimes juxaposes the films sometimes humourous tone. Overall, I feel that the film offers strong special effects, performances and it has interesting story elements but ultimately it fails create any tension or invest its audience during its 2hr 14 minute run time."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Part Lion king, Park Blood Diamond, another classic Marvel Origin Story"
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,8/10,"Seriously, this movie is good, it has a good political social comentary, BUT THE CRITICS OVERRATED IT TOO MUCH, even comparing it to citizen kane (i am not joking), a solid movie that is kinda overrated by the critics"
BLACK PANTHER,15 April 2018,6/10,"I am not a fan of superhero movies so lets start off with that. I dont know the backstory of the characters whatsoever. The plot was so predictable and the ending was disappointing. To me, the movie just wasn't deep enough like there was something missing, everything was just on the surface. But I guess thats why these superhero movies are interconnected and have multiple parts.I really like the actors and the whole execution of the movie so thats why im giving 6 stars.Watch it for the hype and the good graphics nothing more."
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2018,8/10,"A Marvel-ous juxtaposition of colourful African tradition & dress and space-age technology, thanks to a vibranium meteor crashing into central Africa thousands of years ago.We also get some lashings of black history and moral tales therein as T'Challa struggles with his new position of ruler of the mysterious country of Wakanda following the death of his father T'Chaka in the terrorist blast in Vienna as seen in Captain America: Civil War.It also turns out that his Royal predecessors also appeared very stuck in their ways with regards to how they dealt with the local tribes and the outside world all around them, which the new ruler wants to see changed. There is after all, so much more the wealthy can do for the less fortunate. Even if it does mean revealing your secret mountain of vibranium.The newly appointed modern king also has to confront a secret that his father and a good friend kept from him. This leads to a rather unsavoury assault and challenge to his throne.And along the way, we don't just get the odd touch of dealing with a few race issues, feminism gets a good look-in as well given the extremely bad-ass female Wakandan army headed up by General Okoye. Proper not-to-be-messed-with she is, I can tell you.Throw in princess Shuri, sister to T'Challa, who is a funny James Bond 'M'-esque character who invents, builds and supplies weapons and super suits for her brother and we are well on the way to a quite relevant Marvel movie, that is full of action and fun.And we must not forget Andy Serkis who is as amusing as he is menacing as the illegal and ironically-named arms dealer baddie, Ulysses Klaue.Black Panther quite up there with the best of the Marvel Studios movies to date, but one that remains solid throughout and pushes the franchise not just forward but in a slightly different direction.Roll on Infinity War and Captain Marvel that's what I say!Make mine Marvel! And Infinity."
BLACK PANTHER,30 June 2018,10/10,"The action was awesome, great job marvel. Marvel keep up the amazing great work. Again I am team marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2019,9/10,This was a lit movie and the awards also say that.üòâ
BLACK PANTHER,1 November 2018,1/10,"I'll be honest, I'm not a Marvel fan. But let's get something out of the way. This is not the first African American comic book hero. What about Blade and Spawn? Both of those movies were excellent. Even for a Marvel cynic like me, both of those were excellent comic book movies. So let it not be said that I cannot enjoy a comic book movie.It's just that modern day Marvel is unfortunately nothing like Blade from 1998. The action was terrible, the acting was unforgivably bad. The dialogue was of typical modern day Marvel quality. I just can't say anything positive about the movie. sorry but I'm not sorry. I guess they use great CGI, I suppose that's both a compliment and a complaint at the same time.Spare yourself the misery. Just like with Star Wars, let's stop giving these people money until they're replaced. Who knows, when the makers are replaced, we perhaps might get more talented individuals who can lift the quality back up to the standards of Blade. I give a 1 out of 10, just because the interface doesn't support 0 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,26 November 2020,10/10,"I am unfamiliar with the Marvel and DC comics but I do know some of the movies associated with them. Batman in 1989 and X-Men in 2000 both earned their places in my movie collection. I was already sold on the previous Captain America, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and Thor origin movies so I decided, after seeing Civil War, to give Black Panther a fair shot and I was not disappointed by the action, the drama, or the storyline. When I found out that while the Black Panther was battling Thanos, Chadwick Boseman was fighting colon cancer, I was in absolute awe. It is with absolute pride that I give the dearly departed Chadwick Boseman a standing ovation, 2 thumbs up, and a spiritual ""Wakanda Forever"" salute for his incredible performances in the past and for his everlasting contribution to the filming industry. Wakanda Forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2020,7/10,"As the title suggest, it was a good film but does not satisfy the hype. It won 3 Oscars from 7 nominations.
1. Original score 2. Costume design 3. Production design.
Original score means the background music of the film. Few scenes had tremendous background score but wasn't consistent, so there's no point in it. Well ok costumes were good. The lastly, production design which means the sets and overall look of the film. The sets were amazing and really creative but I guess infinity war got better production design.
Now the action, well it was mediocre nothing groundbreaking and the screenplay which is the plot, well also mediocre. The film won BAFTA award for best visual effect, infinity war had great VFX but it wasn't even nominated, so again mediocre. A mediocre film winning 3 Oscars. Well I don't know what critics found in it but for me it was an average film. But it really gives a good experience in theatre"
BLACK PANTHER,4 April 2021,1/10,"SJW garbage. Terrible movie, acting and dialogue is absurd. You're not doing anyone any favors by forcing agendas when there is no divide. It's the Forcing that creates divide ... look at history. Sad, very sad. Golden globe garbage."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2021,10/10,A political action borderline satirical masterpiece.
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2021,8/10,"""Black Panther"" is not a perfect film (it's Marvel), but the fight scenes kept me intrigued and I thought there was actual character development in this. Letitia Wright is very cute and funny as Shuri, and Boseman is just the perfect combination of look, austere, and skill for this role. I saw it in theatres and do not regret that decision one bit. A better Marvel movie than a lot of their recent origin stories."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well the back story was for the various characters. So many times the movie just dives right in and your lost as to who the people are. Overall there was a back end to the main characters and the roles were true to who the characters were written to be. I thought the movie was very well done, it was a little slow at some points but the high points were super high. Even the slow parts had a lot of story to them so it wasn't boring. I feel it is important to build up the story line so I loved every minute of it.I liked that it stayed true to character. My husband had read most of the big comic series and I am a Marvel fan no doubt. Unlike the latest Thor Ragnarok which turned Thor into a comedian and was out of character... ... Black Panther stuck with the original story. And I LOVE THOR but was disappointed.... Anyway... About Black Panther...I think this movie is definitely a must see. I know true Super hero fans will love it and it is good for the whole family, which in my opinion a super hero film should be. Great action scenes, creative story, excellent acting, fantastic costumes and the technology was outrageous. I think that was a breathe of fresh air. Not the same old story again and again.Not to mention I enjoyed not getting cussed at every 5 minutes. The characters held their power and their parts very well. Bravo Marvel! Well done! Going again soon."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,1/10,".....an all AA cast will make a movie in which they do not throw centuries of oppression into the film.
How about you tell an entertaining tale for EVERYONE to enjoy watching instead of making a film that insults white people to the enjoyment of black people?
I REALLY wanted to like this film and I was very impressed with the cast but after the fourth insult towards white people, couched as ""jokes"", I simply lost interest and re-filled my popcorn.
I get it. Black history is full of oppression and wrong doing by whites. I don't even argue that point. Want to REALLY stick it to the oppressors? Make a movie highlighting all your accomplishments, and there are many, showing a mature, strong, even-keeled, heroic leading man and woman and celebrate all that makes black culture great. All accomplished in spite of oppressive whites and without thumping them over the head, but rather by ignoring them.
Way too many insults thrown around towards (greater than) 50% of the population to make this 2.5 hours worth it for anyone."
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2020,6/10,"Only good thing about this was Andy Serkis, the rest is a mishmash of cgi and ""the lion king"" meets ""coming to America""."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,3/10,"There was to much hype about this movie. i expected some sort of cinematic masterpiece after all the hype but was rewarded with a very predictable plot and story line I have seen in dozens of movies before. If you like lots of CGI and action, you will like it. But if you like an original story with intriguing plot twists, this movie is not for you. I think I would have enjoyed it more if critics had not raved about it so much and I went to see it with no expectations. it will be in the 99 cent bin at Walmart at Christmas."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,4/10,"I watched the movie last night. I have not written a review for a long time but i just wanted to help out my friends here who might be misguided by all the positive reviews here. I love all Marvel movies, they are not Oscar winners but my expectation is to be entertained and the most important ingredients have been
Literally ""out of this world"" action!Outstanding effectsWell placed humor ( one liners and all - Best example Thor - Ragnarok) Overall entertainmentThis movie fails on all this. Its a dragged storyline, banal dialogues e.g. a fight scene, someone seems to be hurt and the dialogues go like ""Hw are youuuu"" ""I am good, and you"" ""I am good too"" ""Let's go"". Taken straight from a ""Learn English conversation in 5 minutes"" Chapter IOkay special effects, nothing special,lets say 20 percent of normal Marvel extravaganzas.The story line is weak and goes round and round and round...No menacing bad guy. The potentially menacing one had a lesser role to play.Very stupid and misplaced one liners, completely out of the blues some of them. All in all; i am giving it a 4 , but it could be 5 or 6 if expectations are lowered but it is certainly not the Marvel that we know."
BLACK PANTHER,3 June 2020,,Really good film. Highly recommended. Will see it again as soon as possible. The Best.
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2018,1/10,"I wasted my time with this movie, as I have with other super hero movies of late. The characterisation of Black Panther, as with Ironman, Thor, The Avengers, et al, is simple to say the least. There is no character depth and the plot in BP was as weak as any of the others. The only thing going for these genre films is special effects, which when broken down may look good, but are totally divorced from reality."
BLACK PANTHER,29 June 2018,4/10,"This is the movie edition of Iron Fist. Bad acting. Fight scenes crazy bad. CGI is terribel. Plot, see through. The 4 points i give it is because og the family its coming from. Cant make my self give any Marvel movie only 1 point :)"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,7/10,"I'm not a huge fan of super-hero films. This one was good, but definitely not great. Unfortunately, due to all the hype I was really ready for a great super-hero/action film, and it just wasn't compelling enough. Some special effects were good, others weak. The first 20-25 minutes were pretty snoozer before the plot picked up. All in all good, but nowhere near the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,1 November 2019,6/10,"Black Panther has a strong start that deceivingly promises viewers of a memorable film, only to end up just like the bulk of Marvel movies. Predictably formulaic, bloated and tiresome. Whilst the film isn't entirely devoid of merit, its mild form of momentary entertainment isn't noteworthy."
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2018,2/10,"When I first saw this movie I wanted to write an honest review but I couldnt. On twitter, whatsapp everywhere are people waiting to tell you how racist, unsupportive,jealous any black person is for not thinking this is the best movie ever cos it has lots of black people in it. Today I watched Thor Ragnarok for the first time and I can no longer stay silent. There's a reason why I watch superhero films and it's to be wowed. Where were the scenes that saw black panther kicking ass, where were the scenes that showed his character develop, that showed the other character's arc? Where were the fight scenes that should have blown my mind away? Where was the story that had suspense and plot twists? Those things were absent from this film. There was only one funny scene. This film is quite dull and borING. I rated it two because of the Dino Melaye. we should all be honest enough to admit that the success of this film has very little to do with merit and a lot to do with sentiment. Thanks Marvel for the masterclass in film marketing."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,7/10,"Has everyone forgotten this is a superhero movie? It's a superhero movie that follows a super hero plot - of course its essential plot infrastructure (of good triumphs over evil) and character basics (of T'Challa bring the humble, kind, merciful warrior and the antagonist being full of hate and essentially tyrannical) are going to be predictable, that's how it works! Black Panther hit a perfect balance between plot substance and action - perhaps people are upset because there isn't an overwhrlming presence of action? Winter Soldier has mostly high ranking user reviews, but it was 80% action and 20% plot making it incredibly boring and far more ""garbage,"" ""irritatingly bad,"" ""over rated,"" etc. deserving than Black Panther. Great Marvel instalment that was far better than Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron, and Civil War. Who knew people hated to see a film about a rich country's entanglement with a man who wants to rectify the poverty stricken environment he grew up in? Doesn't sound interesting for a Marvel movie AT ALL when it's bretheren typically only focus on fighting each other or some weird, nonsensical quest to defeat a robot... and fight each other. Again."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"First off, really enjoyed it and so did my little boy (12). There were some great characters fleshed out really well with a great cast, plenty of standard comic book action and some funny banter/quips between characters which never felt out of place (T'Challa and his sisters banter is really enjoyable).Even though there's a lot of technology on show the films never feels too ""techie"" and, at it's heart, it keeps grounded and true to it's tribal kingdom roots. The main arc T'Challa character arc of taking on the Black Panther/King mantel, the tribes and storyline around that is really well done.Outside that there are some regulation car chases, shoot-outs, fights, etc which are pretty standard Marvel fare and nothing great. They look good (obviously) but are a little OTT and distracting from the well acted, grounded plotlines. There's also the annoyance of the overacting, ham-master himself Andy Serkis.All-in-all, it's a very solid comic book movie with some great sections (see above re: grounded, realistic story bits) and some decent standard Marvel schlock. Better than most Marvel movies it's fare to say, and yes it does have a great cast too!Definitely worth watching but not, as some have said, a 97% hit or as good as the critics are trying to have you believe (I assume that's more a case of pushing it's first black superhero thing - Blade might not have been the first but it wasn't that long ago, was it!?!?)"
BLACK PANTHER,8 October 2018,4/10,"I'm not even going to get into how this movie is really over-hyped. I finally watched this when all the popularity surrounding it had died down, so I'll just give my perspective on the substance. The movie definitely had some of the best visuals and set pieces in almost any other Marvel movie, but the idea of Wakanda and the comics to begin with just gives a huge range of options and boundless area for creativity with this superhero and atmosphere. A secret civilization far more technologically advanced than any other first world country, basically the equivalent if Tony Stark owned his own small country. Warring tribes and factions of groups all vying for the thrown based on a unique political climate. Yet even with all these amazing ideas and the great filmography that made every shot look stunning, I couldn't help but feel it all came up short. For instance, even the actors involved were an all-star lineup, but it seems like most of the characters they portrayed had bland dialogue and one dimensional personalities that had little depth to them. A major exception to this, however, was Killmonger who was a very good villain even though his ""master plan"" at the end was a little weird and vague. Andy Serkis was also entertaining beyond no ends as Klawe which is not surprising for him. The plot was almost comically predictable as well where you could guess what was going to happen a mile away as if we had all already seen this exact same plot before, and some of the characters actions did not seen genuine and seemed to just happen to move the formulaic plot forwards where we all already knew it was headed. The fact that T'Challa just happened to appear with the mountain tribe is some coincidence. Martin Freeman's character also seemed ridiculously unnecessary and the idea of a CIA operative being a selfless hero is just absurd in my personal opinion, but hey, maybe the CIA are different in the Marvel Universe compared to real life.Overall, it had more ups than downs and the visually appealing shots and filmography was enough alone to keep anyone entertained watching this movie. Now that it's on Netflix, there's absolutely no reason not to watch this and it gives a good precursor to how the Marvel phase 3 tech suits and weapons will look (Iron Man's nanotech suits).Final score: 6.7/10 rounded to 7."
BLACK PANTHER,11 August 2018,3/10,"Fine acting and pretty technicolor but this makes me doubt IMBD's rating system. The plot was so trite and had zero sense of jeapordy. Made it impossible to really care what happened. Such a shame as it obviously had a big budget. 
If you're looking for a good super hero movie go watch Man of Steel, Justice League, Dr Strange or both Deadpool's. This one could have been great but definitely fell short for me."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"Black Panther was a solid movie, but it's nowhere near what the critics are making it out to be. All of the special effects were very good, and the parts were acted very well. The problem is that it kind of lacked this groundbreaking substance that we're being led to believe is there. The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, ""oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being."" I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, those are NOT credible critics. There's no way. It's in the top ten, and it was better than a lot of other movies over the last couple of years, but come on. All of that being said, it's worth watching. but maybe just temper your expectations if you've only been following the ""big name"" reviewers."
BLACK PANTHER,15 November 2019,4/10,"Just bland. It had some nice camera work, rare but some decent shots. Poor writing, most actors did the best with what they had. Rushed the effects department, final fight looks like a playstation 1 game. This movie is formulaic and uninspired. It hits the basic comic book movie cliches. If you are watching the MCU through for first time, you could skip this one and miss nothing. I saw it after Endgame. I still haven't seen Captain Marvel, but I understood everything in Endgame so the two don't seem necessary. Same goes for Thor: Dark World."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"Shame I can't rate this 0/10.Movie could of been good if not for some people clearly pushing a political opinion but in the end everything was awful, the timing of the jokes, no expression or any kind of physical comedy when saying the jokes, everything was just awful.Could of tried to make it a little bit less obvious that is movie isn't really about the movie at all lol.I was excited for this, but honestly, worst film I've watched in a long time. Hatchet was better and that was a mere time killer and awful at the same time. I wouldn't even watch this again if I was in a hospital bed, rather be in silence and doing nothing."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2018,6/10,"Just above average which is why I give it 6 stars, but there was plenty of 'ho hum' moments. I definitely found the villains more interesting and engaging than the 'good guys'. It was somewhat entertaining but the kind of movie I'll quickly forget about."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I'm from Asia and I don't understand the discrimination and racial crisis of Blacks and Whites in US. So I went to see the movie expecting it to be another good movie from MCU ( you have to admit they do have a good track record). And what I got instead was pure gold. 
I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, ""The Dark Continent"". We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,7/10,"To be honest, i'm done watching all the 'super hero movies'.. With 20 marvel movies in 10 years you get the point.. So when i started watching this 'Black Panther' i didnt have high hopes of it beeing anything good or at least beeing above average. Tho i was mostly right about my feeling i underestimated the movie, it was very entertaining and good acting.The black 'vibe' can be felth from start to finish.Plot : The plot is again a bit boring and typical realy, we have a boy whos father got killed by the hand of (previous) King of Wakanda.. many years later that boy -Grown up by now - arrives in Wakanda to rise as king of wakanda *SPOILER* by killing our new king (The black panther) in a ceremonial fight.. Or so we think, ofcourse he is not dead.After beeing revived and going back to Wakanda and killing the bad guy they save Wakanda and therefore the entire world... How typical. But still.. worth a watch :) It has a good story, good telling, good CGI, very good acting.So in all i can give this a high 7. 
Maybe a 8 
Watchable but dont expect to much.Cheers."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,9/10,"Going into the theater, I was thinking this movie would turn out to be another 8 or 8.5 Marvel movie. Fortunately, I was mistaken. Chadwick was at the top of his game in this film. I wasn't surprised that Danai would kick awesome butt throughout the movie. My new favorite character in the MCU is Shuri. I feel like I relate to her in some ways: she's beautiful, has a sense in fashion, and is the smartest person in the entire MCU, beating Tony Stark out as the smartest. The action scenes were perfect and the storyline is everything. I definitely recommend this movie. Best Marvel movie to date!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2018,6/10,"Black Panther was a joy to watch, from it's ability to keep you invested throughout the entirety of the film, to it's set of amazing cast members, great use of the soundtrack, memorable characters, and it's overwhelmingly relatable antagonist. I can't lie, Killmonger made this movie for me from beginning to end. I loved everything about his character, his ambitions, everything he did to achieve what he wanted, it makes you question if he was truly the villain, no? Truly one can feel empathy with such a great antagonist. The CGI wasn't that great honestly, it was either averagely passable or poor. As well as I noticed that for every confirmed kill there wasn't a single drop of blood spilled from the character, and if there was there wasn't as much as it's supposed to, noticeably one kill that Killmonger does where he slices the neck of a character and nothing comes out of her neck, it kept disturbing me. But apart from these two things, Black Panther is a must-watch this year and totally recommendable!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,4/10,"Visually, cool as heck. Effects were on point. Michael B Jordan as a villain was AMAZING. All else...skip. I wanted to like this movie and looked forward to it after BP's debut in Civil War. 
His character and performance, and the movie wasn't nearly as good as BP in Civil War. I was very disappointed last night. And I'm a huge fan of the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,15 January 2019,7/10,This is a good film but popular for the wrong reasons. Personally is not even in the top half of my favorite MCU movies.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2019,3/10,This film was totally political and did well in the box office because of that and because everyone wanted to be ready for avengers infinity war not the worst mcu film but far far far far far from the best only the acting is good otherwise would have been 1 star
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"Very Creative.
Best cinematography, music, direction and execution. The Story is good. And the making is fantastic."
BLACK PANTHER,13 August 2018,7/10,"Short Review -
I personally liked it after watching thrice. The simple plot & the emotional factors were good but after seeing Rotten Tomatoes giving 98% and Metacritic giving 88 I was unflattered. Yeah it's a good movie but no near The Dark Knight.
Visuals sucks (comparing it's budget) & so many plot holes.
It's a good movie but not the best superhero movie."
BLACK PANTHER,26 September 2019,9/10,"I don't know why people'd hate this movie. It's an extraordinarily excellent movie even though it has a colossal amount of action and violence to fill the movie. But still, a great movie"
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2019,8/10,Black Panther is a good film .I like it because I like films with super heroes . this film is futuristic .cool and action .in one part the black panther figth with his brother
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2021,9/10,Ignore the haters. This film was culture event. Most of the people hating on this film or probably are not black. The film made a billion dollars. It was one of marvel highest box office.
BLACK PANTHER,26 July 2020,2/10,"It definitely did not live up the other Marvel movies. I have to say the SFX were great but this movie was just ..Blah!
Then they had the dumb white guy in it who was constantly having faces made at him...kind of a payback it seemed.
They really built up the first Marvel Black super hero a little too much as it did not really make him the hero in the movie it was more a team effort.
What was a shame the theaters were letting in kids too young to see this movie and it was definitely too violent for them.
If you want a Black super hero watch a Blade movie....Snipes is a Bad Ass.
Maybe the Marvel movies are just running into each other too much I don't know but I do know I will not go to see another Black Panther movie if it is anything like this one."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,The Wakanda Kingdom is what Africa would look like if not for the corrupt leaders & a dark history of European oppression. Good amazing cast with good dialogue of African English accent. Mostly West African accent.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"As others have said, the movie suffers from weaknesses in the writing and and an under-ambitious plot, but the imaginative depiction of Wakanda, combined with Chadwick Boseman's charisma in the lead makes the whole thing pretty enjoyable all the same. Overall, I liked Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War, liked him throughout this movie, and came out of the theater looking forward to seeing more of the character in Infinity Wars.My main gripe would be that the conflict motivation in the story is highly under-used. The premise is pretty interesting, that Black Panther's home country of Wakanda is as big a technological power as Asgaard, but has been concealing this throughout history and likewise has been remaining neutral in world conflicts, even though their technology could have been a powerful force, for example, against black oppression throughout the ages. It takes very little imagination to see the widespread political outrage that this could cause if it leaked out, with potentially thousands of people and powerful radical enemy organizations trying to take control of that technology from T'Challa. Instead, the writers decided to limit the antagonistic forces to basically just one disgruntled guy. As a result, the movie comes off as a bit of a knock-off of the first Thor movie, except that here it's Killmonger instead of Loki who threatens a one-man coup of the kingdom. Anyway, still enjoyable, as I said, but I will always regret what the movie could have been"
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2021,5/10,"These days I'm watching all marvel series films chronologically. After watching Iron man all part, captain America all part, hulk etc. This film is little boring as compared to previous films. Storyline is good, cast are also best at their performances. What made me bore let me tell u, the vfx, the wakanda state roller-coaster scenes. As much as I exited to enjoy d film it is not that interesting. I barely finished the film ; first day 1 hour n then next day 1 hour this way managed to finish it."
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,2/10,"This is probably the worst Sci-Fi movie I've seen in years... - Pity as it really had potential considering the Actors involved. 
Above all, the story is totally insane!
Just ask yourself - why would a technologically superior race be a monarchy? Wakanda is a peaceful race, yet they have weapons that can easily obliterate the Earth. The whole society is deeply traditional that even their king can be challenged to a duel where he/she can be killed... Nothing, really nothing in this film makes sense. 
This is one of those blockbusters you watch today, and tomorrow you will not remember a single good thing about it, so save your time and find a better movie to see."
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,6/10,That must be a bad joke to select this movie an oscar nominee. Jurors must be fired urgently.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"While Wakanda is a marvel to behold, The story in Black Panther is quite generic and predictable. The action is light and far from revolutionary. The film's basic structure mimics that of 2011's Thor. Killmonger is an solid villain, although his limited screentime and certain dialogue prevents him from being the greatest but he's one of better villains The MCU has. Phase 3 overall has been much better in the villain department. The CGI painfully reminds of PS2 video games especially in the 3rd act. While the tone is more serious, it doesn't erase the fact that this film's vibranium weaving has some cracks. It's an good film but not the masterpiece being touted. The performances elevated a rather generic and predictable story. C"
BLACK PANTHER,13 August 2019,4/10,"Worst Marvel Movie yet. I hate it, its so damn trashy, almost like Idiocracy but there it was intended lol"
BLACK PANTHER,27 September 2018,6/10,"Black Panther is a good film, but not great. I feel Marvel/Disney relied more on the ""first Black superhero movie"" hype than anything else. Which worked, but this is still a pretty basic, paint-by-numbers Marvel flick."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2019,6/10,It was a good movie dont get me wrong. Its just wasn't as good as wohoooo wakanda crazy movie!! It was a very predictable classic super hero movie imo. Main character loses and has to do this task and redeem himself before defeating the final boss. Theres a intro fight and ending fight as usual. TONS of flaws and stuff that dont make sense in the movie like he loses consciousness ans gets found in friend tribe.. Which they didn't say anything this whole time??? But let him go as soom as someone comes asking LOL
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,2/10,"With all of the hype and positive reviews, I was sure this was a slam dunk. Boy was I wrong. I have never seen a movie so over hyped in all my life. And yes, I'll tell you why. Because it is a BLACK movie. That's it. That's all. Super hyped and overrated based on skin color. Can we all just get past that already... I judged this movie on it's merits. And there were NONE. The only redeeming factor were the female characters. Angela Bassett is gorgeous and under utilized. The female warriors are the best part. They are beautiful and kick major butt. Aside from that, there is absolutely nothing to like about this film. Forrest Witacker is completely miscast the accents throughout are not believable. I am very, very disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,4/10,I agree with a lot of people here who stated that the movie was much hyped. I understand we need to boost the new holly-black-wood. But where is the true sense of good films? The thing is that this movie makes me wonder whether I would watch the next Marvel film. It's really that tip-over point. At least I am tired of going in cinema and watch bland heroes.
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2020,5/10,"I like it a bit. But the acting is like some class C movie. Plot is so boring i nearly fall asleep twice watching it. Actors are just crap. There is not a single good actor on it. Even Forest Whitaker played like it was his first ever movie.
Other things. Why there are only black actors in wakanda? We have black Vikings in Asgard, we have black knights, but here? Non a single whit guy.
This is one of the worst marvel movie i ever seen"
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,1/10,"This is not a good movie in any way. Probably one of the worst marvel movies. The plot is boring, the acting is bad. The only actor that tried to act is Andy Serkis, the other actors literally didn't show any acting skills and just were reading the script. This movie is by far the most over-hyped movie on the world."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,10/10,"I really liked Black Panther. Marvel has done a much better movie than Thor 3. 
The color grading is beautiful. The locations of Africa are amazing. The actors do a very good job. They are damn good looking too. The humor is well placed this time.It is a very refreshing superhero movie, something we had not seen before for these type of movies. I would recommend everyone to watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,3/10,"I really am dumbfounded as to why so many ""official"" reviews are exceptionally glowing of this movie. It's almost as if reviewers are scared, for some reason, to admit that the movie is mediocre at best. It's almost as though identity politics have struck fear into the hearts of the reviewers.Lucky for you though, I have no such fear in my heart. This movie was rubbish. Okay, it wasn't rubbish, but it wasn't far from being rubbish. The story was boring and I found the politically motivated comments about ""whites"" to be cringe-worthy.I gave this movie a 3 because I'm smarter than most (no offence) and didn't like much about it, but, if I were your average dolt, I would say that a 6/10 would have been a more appropriate score."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"For anyone wondering about the disparity between the 100% positive critics reviews on RottenTomatoes and the not quite as universally high ratings here do yourself and Google ""Anti Black Panther Campaign"". Putting aside all that nonsense Black Panther is simply a FANTASTIC piece of entertainment from start to finish.I've seen every single MCU film to date and this one stands with the very very best of them. For a while now the MCU films have been starting to get into a bit of a formulaic rut. At worst they're always at least entertaining but Black Panther is a true return to form with exactly the right mix of humor, action, drama, style and sheer wow factor. Do not let anyone convince you that the film is preachy or over the top with political soapboxing. That's simply not the case. The themes explored here are UNIVERSAL and could have been applied to virtually any culture, while at the same time the incredible costuming, soundtrack, and art direction tapped deeply into dozens of African cultures to create a visual and stylistic tapestry that was simply breathtaking.Even if that holds no appeal whatsoever, taken simply as a work of pure action entertainment the movie delivers by every measure. Action was fantastic, fight choreography the best since Netflix's Daredevil, and a stronger narrative arc than any MCU movie to date. The storytelling was simply superb with a clear beginning, middle, and end and rock solid character development. The writer did not fall into the recent pitfall of other MCU films of spinning out too many sub-plots or characters and instead masterfully focused on the core story at hand. As such this may well be the best stand alone MCU film since we were first introduced to Tony Stark in Iron Man, while still fitting perfectly into the larger MCU pantheon.Believe the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2018,5/10,"Terrible African accents through out and a crap story line, I like super hero films, series and this was the worst.. What was the hype about?"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,5/10,"What reallly took me off was the story. a couple of points:
-new guy noone has seen in his life comes to claim the throne of the most technologically advanced society in an attempt to change the ways of this society. A society that from what we know is prospering and loves their king.Now you would expect people to go against it but in black panther theyre like 'fine lets change everything we know for a guy that we have never seen before and go into war something that we have never done before'. same thing happened in ragnarok but there people were rightfully not ok with it. 
-Even when the coup is ongoing for no apparent reason it also stops for no apparent reason. The right hand of warmonger somewhere remembers that his wife is fighting for the opposing side and like that calls the coup off.
-most technologically advanced society having survived some thousand of years and they crown the guy that can win in a brawl. makes sense...
-actors simply did not act. they went from place A to place B to do things.
-who on earth has a palace with no walls when its freezing outside?
overall worst mcu movie i can remember. dont understand the hype"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,5/10,"Huge props to the production design and the supporting actors, but that's that. The juxtaposition of tribalism and advancement did not work, dated VFX, the main actors (except MBJ) are unnecessarily articulate, the dialogues are too fictitious."
BLACK PANTHER,25 June 2018,5/10,"I love the marvel universe, grew up with the comics especially Hulk and Spider-Man and Thor. There have been weak movies, yes brilliant movies,magazine yes but this is not one of them. 5 for technical brilliance, but three for the abysmal story, accents that fluctuated. I do not get what the critics raved about.mi get the equalities agenda bit but that doesn't disguise a mediocre product."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,"Thanks for a wonderful performance even while battling cancer. Few people could've done what you did and even fewer could've done it with such panache.This movie doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, I agree, but it doesn't deserve all those 1's and 2's from the haters either. It remains to this day, one of the best standalone Marvel movies ever made.You'll be sorely missed.8/10"
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,1/10,"Was really looking forward to this movie as the black panther is one of my favourites but once again there are lots of political correctness involved which for me killed the movie along with its boring plot ,wooden acting and overhyped tech"
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,1/10,Pc movie this boring film as nothing on blade or deadpool
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2018,10/10,GREAT MOVIE. Easily on of the best superhero movies ever made and easily the best marvel movie ever made. I cant wait for Black Panther 2. Hopefully he will also appear in Avengers 4 as well.
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2019,2/10,"My son is 3 years and 8 months old.He could have written this simplistic drivel.""And then the magic rhino......"".It is awful. Truly, truly awful. Embarrassing yet popular. I despair. Standards are dropping to new lows.One extra star for 1 line that made me laugh a little. Other than that, drivel of the purest kind."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2019,8/10,"It's hard to believe the same company that put out the debacle known as Thor 3 also gave us this splendid film. Exceptional in every way.
A movie for the times.. We all must look after one another as though we are from the same tribe. Profound."
BLACK PANTHER,14 July 2018,8/10,"Yes there was some excessive hype 
No it is not the bestest best MCU movie (imo)
Yes it does have the best, most relatable, and human villain 
No the entire planet was not gonna explode with citizens helplessly running for once
Yes the special effects and music were bomb
Yes the casting was perfect as always tnxmarvel"
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2019,7/10,"Was a good movie. Entertained me, some nice action and comedy. I liked the vast majority of the characters and the acting. I thought the story was actually quite good too.
What I didn't like:
1) Way too much CGI. There's no reason why the developers could not have had martial artists in the Panther suits for the fight scenes. That would have been awesome but instead they opted for CGI characters and the CGI wasn't that good.
2) Not even a basic explanation as to how an ancient tribe managed to harness the technology of the vibranium meteorite. Iron Man is awesome because we know how the suit came to be. Similarly with Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow etc. That's what adds so much more to a story yet here we're supposed to believe that ancient people where able to harness vibranium and a teenager is the one and only brain behind most of modern Wakandan technology. I wasn't expecting anything in depth, just some basic story behind it.
3) The injection of political opinion. And the movie was actually pretty racist. I mean black tribes hooting like monkeys? How is that not racist. Regarding the injection of politics - it is just so unnecessary. And it wasn't even accurate either, like taking the stance that black slums exist due to evil white people and how fixing up buildings in these slums is going reduce the percentage of fatherless black families.
Anyway the movie was entertaining and that's mostly all I expect from the Marvel movies. Every now and then a Marvel movie offers a bit more but not this one."
BLACK PANTHER,21 August 2019,6/10,Quite disappointing all round once you get past the special effects. Story is lame. Soundtrack is woeful.
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,,"This is the movie over hyped movie I have ever seen. Came in expecting a great movie, went out disappointed after watching a typical, predictable marvel movie.Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that was heavily affected by politics, such as diversity and inclusiveness and all that. When I watch a movie, I don't look for diversity and inclusiveness, I look for an enjoyable movie that has an interesting plot, good characters and maybe some deeper meaning, and looking from a neutral standpoint this movie is just so painfully average."
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,9/10,"Had a lot of fun watching this film, action packed and Wakanda's culture is very interesting for a made up country. This one is up there with my favorites from the MCU, worth the watch."
BLACK PANTHER,18 November 2019,1/10,Cringey and political. I said what I said. This was almost as bad as the Avengers
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,5/10,"Sad to see yet another glowing Marvel review for a so so film. Rotten Tomatoes actually said this brought MCU to ""thrilling new heights""...what?!! Give me a break! These movie websites should categorically be open about manipulating ratings. . First, the terrible plotholes. In what advanced'civilization do criminals get to challenge for kingship? Didn't Black Panther witness first hand Erik blowing up the jail cell, freeing the murderer, yet he never brought it up when Erik wanted to be king. Second, can someone name a country in the world where a first-time visitor can walking act like an over-the-top brat , insult all the rulers, act as a crazed lunatic and yet: (1) ts not kicked out from the country as persona-non grata. (2) gets loyalty from the natives of this 'advanced civilization'."
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2019,5/10,Plot is easy to follow like any other Marvel film. Straight to the point but nothing makes it stand out from the rest. The comedy is good but the use of vibranium is questionable.
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,5/10,"When this movie got in every news, I have a very high expectation that this would be a top rated, best of the best marvel movie. Hmm... after watching it, I realize my expectation was too way high.Overall here are my reviews:1. New Marvel character is a black. This good enough. We have 'diversity' hollywood always praise about. Though I dream Denzel Washington will be the man. That would be awesome. Why not choose Denzel Washington instead?2. The plot is boring and get into political too much. Inspiring people to get a world wide war revolution against other people is too much racist to me. This movie, will inspire all people from all over the world, whether black or not, if feel 'oppressed' to raise arms and against other peaceful people. I am not worrying people from China, Russia, or other Communist/Buddhist/Christianity majority countries. I am worrying countries like Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Lebanon, where the muslims population is quiet high while they always dream supremacy but in fact they socially and economically mostly lower than non muslims. Those kind of people, with the hate teaching core, will have this movie as a must movie to watch in their recruitment program. In this case, hollywood is trash, you make chaos in every part of the world.3. The message of the movie is weak. If you think arming people to go into war is not good, then make it clear and give a strong message."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"I was honored to receive an invite to attend an advanced screening of Marvel's latest release, ""Black Panther"". I will be honest I didn't know a lot about this character before reading about him recently and seeing the film. The story line crosses both racial and cultural lines which has made this super hero a fan favorite for more than 50 years and I really love him now too. He is a fierce fighter and is empathetic to those around him. He has a big heart and wants to do his very best.T'Challa is haunted by the mistakes of his father and is also a flawed person but puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the best king he can be for his people. During his transformation to King he goes to the land of his ancestors and is able to have a brief talk with his father. His father assures him he will be a good king but it will be hard because he has a good heart. This is a weakness and something he has to figure out how to balance with his leadership and superhero roles. I really enjoyed watching Mr. Boseman as this character and he brought not only a fierceness to the role but also a sensitivity and a humor that was just so human and optimistic. Things might be hard but he tried to come with an openness and we saw more of that come to fruition as the movie progressed.I loved the entire cast of this movie and felt like the right people were put into the right roles. I can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The performances were incredibly strong although I definitely felt like Shuri, T'Challa's sister played by Letitia Wright, stole the show. I just loved her character! She was strong, funny and intelligent. She is the force behind inventing much of the Wakandan modern technology (if this was Bond, she would be Q) and most specifically the Black Panther suit. On top of all that, she is a character girls are going to look to and be inspired by. I really loved the chemistry between all of the characters and felt like they genuinely liked or loved each other. It didn't feel forced.I felt like the action really kept in line with what is shown in other Marvel movies. In fact I felt like there was less fighting and violence in this film than in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and some of the other Marvel Studios films. There is sword play and a couple of scenes using guns but the most dramatic fight scenes are hand to hand battles for the throne.After seeing this movie I couldn't help thinking back to last year and seeing the new ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing a woman yield such incredible power, yet being allowed to also be tender, hit me so hard. I walked away from Black Panther with the same feeling I had with ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing fierce, powerful, intelligent, tender women standing up and being a part of the action spoke to me and I cheered for them every time they picked up a spear or showed the technology they created or acted as advisers. I really liked that the women were treated as equals. There was equal ""saving of each other"", never portraying the women as weaker and needing help. They worked together. This spoke to the message at the end of the film that we all need to learn that we are one tribe on this earth and we all need to look out for each other. We highly recommend the film!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,"I went to watch this movie a week late, and by then I had heard rave reviews about it. These ranged from how it's a swansong for the colored peoples to how Killmonger was the best MCU villain of all time. To be frank, it was neither. In fact, it is safe to say that Tom Hiddlestone's Loki is still the best in the MCU with close competition from David Tennant's Killgrave (Purple Man).The point of this entire movie is to show the story behind the mysterious ruler of Wakanda, and it does this quite beautifully. (However, I could not really enjoy the little details in the visuals because of a really annoying kid sitting next to me while I was watching it.) The idea behind the visuals though was exquisite. There was something beautiful about the way that the city was shown, and at this point I would rather go there than Asgard. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that T'Challa kills Killmonger because he wanted to open the doors of Wakanda, only to end up doing the same thing in order to woo Nakia.The characterization of the colored in Hollywood movies has always bothered me. Even in this movie, the only white man to actually be in the entire movie is a war hero, rather than the coward he is in the source material. Killmonger happens to be a beautifully written character, even in the comics. None of the charm of that character is from the actor. In fact, I believe that a child in the same role would have shown a similar emotional range. The anger and mystery we had come to adore about T'Challa (in Civil War) vanishes with this movie. He becomes a King and that takes away his warrior spirit (so to speak). I think it's safe to say now that when Tony Stark dies (we all know he is, so just accept it), Shuri will be the best person to take over as the brains of the Avengers. Nakia is probably the least irritating female lead in a Marvel movie. Maybe it's just that she doesn't whine about the safety of the title character.The true scene-stealer in this movie is M'Baku (Man-Ape), the leader of the Jabari. Even his quips don't feel out of character, and that is saying something for a Marvel movie. (Please don't watch this movie if you haven't read a single Black Panther comic)Overall this movie makes for a decent watch. If you are looking to watch this movie to stay updated on the next steps of the MCU, you will be sorely disappointed. The ending is the only thing that even takes the larger universe into account."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,6/10,"I did do a twitter campaign one year and it seems that now some film makers are doing what I had hoped for, merged Africa with Hollywood. Black Panther integrates effectively the African continent into the science fiction genre. We get a version of the African star wars. The manuscript has integrated values and feministic critic towards ideals about females and how to dress, actually they give another point of view of what not to wear, so in fact this is lovely, since the Hollywood stereotypes need some critic. We are more values than one on this planet and it is fresh to see that other values can be given space in a movie. Also the females are strong African women, they are also diversified, since there are different versions of their personalities. A princess a little bit rebellious, technological and scientific, which is awesome. Females in other roles than the regular. Breaking new frontiers, just as Star trek. So perhaps my header is wrong... maybe this is more of a African Star Trek, than an African Star Wars? Well, I wouldn't say that, but they do the same with norm critic as the Next generation Start trek does. But this is a fighting movie, with cool ships, advanced technology and such, which is more like Star wars. The designs in this movie feel like a modern Africa, so give new technology to Africa and this is a possible outcome really. So the designs feel really African and somehow the old traditions are integrated into this movie, just as old traditions also have merged into Star Wars. Therefor this movie has more common ground with Star Wars than Star Trek really. This is indeed the African version. Also Western history and present is in question in this movie, we get some norm critic integrated into the movie. Some norm critic where really punches to the people that placed people in races, whites vs. black's in history, even today. Africa is no longer a third world country in this movie, they are more advanced, but their traditions hinder them from taking over the world, they want to have better values, so they simply hide their possibilities from the rest of the world. Indirect his could be a allergory for African culture having so much good values, like being kind, loving and close to nature in many ways, and people don't really see it. The values are given space in this film. Which I think is good and we are given a perspective for a bad guys life experiences, so that we better can understand why the person ended up hateful. Of course the message in the end is to give love. That the solution is to communicate and love each other. If you like science fiction, in the Star wars category, then this is the film for you. They make bad jokes, just as the real Star wars. But it is all twisted up in other values really. You'll understand once you see the movie. So enjoy Africas step up in Hollywood, from the stereotype roles as poor and full of primitive ideas to the advanced plattform of science fiction. No more blood thirsty pirates from African continent, not a first glampse anyway... can't say more than that without spoiling the movie. So enjoy African science fiction, dear reader."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,8/10,"Black panther starts out shortly after the events of civil war where we saw T'Challa's father die. Black panther follows T'Challa's struggles as both king of Wakanda and the Black panther. Ryan coogler has expertly crafted a film with relevant social and political commentary that never comes off as preachy while retaining all the elements of a blockbuster MCU film.Black panther was a badass in civil war and Chadwick boseman brings the same gravitas and the stoic presence in Black panther. Although this time we get to see his emotional side as well and boseman brings a lot of depth to the character.Marvel has nailed it with the casting almost every time and Black panther is no exception. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Everett Ross and Ulysses Klaue respectively and without a doubt they are excellent as always. Everett Ross wasn't a big part of Civil war but here we get to see and learn a lot more about him and the same goes for Klaue whom we saw in Age of Ultron. Serkis' maniacal performance as Klaue was very entertaining and I wish he had more to do in this film.In this film we get to see the Dora Milaje, that is the royal guard of Wakanda in action and learn a lot about them through their general Akoye played by Danai gurira who is loyal to Wakanda and respects her traditions. She has some of the coolest action scenes and is very intimidating. Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o is a badass spy who travels around the world helping out people in need. The women in the film sort of play the voice of reason for T'Challa and contribute a lot to the plot. Shuri played by Letita Wright who is T'Challa's sister is the more modern character who things traditional rituals are boring. She is the head of technology so she's kind of a nerd but when its necessary she doesn't shy away from a fight.Other notable performances would be by Angela Basset who plays T'Challa's mother and Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi. Also Forest Whitaker is in the movie who is superb and Winston Duke who plays M'Baku had some of the funniest moments.Michael B. Jordan steals every scene he is in as probably the best marvel villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. He has a lot of charisma and a clear motivation for why he does the things he does. His motivations are to do good but the things that he does to achieve his goal are wrong. Jordan nails every aspect of his character especially the emotional moments that helps the audience relate to him and care about him even though he is a bad person who has done despicable things.Ryan coogler gives us a Wakanda that feels real and lived in and not a fictional country. Wakandan culture is rich and beautiful. Their traditions and rituals are interesting and there is a great contrast between their primitive culture and their advancements in technology which make Wakanda very different from the rest of the world. The visuals paired with an exceptional soundtrack with both traditional and modern music make for an immersive and surreal experience.For all its merits Black panther is not without its flaws. The action scenes are sometimes really cool but other times not so good. There were moments when you couldn't understand what was happening because the scene was too dark. The green screen was noticeable in some scenes especially towards the CGI heavy climax of the film. The visual effects in Marvel films have always been very impressive in the past and its disappointing to see such bad effects in one of the best films the MCU has put out . The film also suffers from some pacing issues and Killmonger's screen time could've been extended.A few gripes aside Black panther has some splendid performances, a compelling villain and relevant social commentary that makes it more than just a MCU film. Black panther is an exceptional film and I highly recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,7/10,"I doubt that even with his army training he would stand a chance if one of these guys decided to punch his Jenny. In all, I'd rate this movie as solid yet predictable. Creed was a pleasant surprise, he's come a long way since getting knocked out by a soft looking British gent. I'm hoping Black Panther plays a rightfully larger role in the upcoming Avengers movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"97% Rotten Tomatoes. Really? Critics have gone mad or been paid a descent amount of money.It has no special story, and the plot is totally predictable. Colors and visuals are the only gorgeous parts of this film. I felt cheated after how amazingly Black Panther was shown in Civil War.It has been released in 3D but there are merely a few shots that felt good in 3D.Overall acting is okay; no actor leaves their mark on your mind. And as always, this Marvel movie too suffers with the villain deficiency syndrome.6 out of 10 from me, that's it."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,2/10,"What can I say. I never liked a Marvel movie and also I'm not a DC fan. But I just like the respectful People who are trying to respect me and made a respectful movie. And I never found that at any super hero movie Except the Dark Knight ( only the dark knight not the full trilogy ).Marvel they are making a huge number worldwide and that's why they will never change their boring rhythm. Black pantherBad acting
Bad writing
Bad accent 
Bad make up and dressing

Bad fight scenesSo the conclusion is u know"
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,2/10,"I should have read the ""actual"" reviews here... instead I fell for the hype that this was ""one of the best Marvel movies of all time""... yeah right...I know the Marvel movies are loaded with CGI special effects, but this one took it WAY over the top... and quite a bit of it was done pretty poorly...Most of the characters are forgettable... I'm not even sure who the 20 year old ""tech girl"" was that designs suits cooler than Iron Mans... that his sister? or ex-girlfriend or something? whatever...Majority of the acting was rigid, unbelievable...Even the soundtrack in this didn't work for me... And the story itself just seemed to come completely out of left field... I'm used to some pretty outlandish stuff in comic based movies, but the Loki lead alien attack on NYC was more plausible than 3/4 of the stuff in this movie...I dunno what's up with overall IMDB score on this... seems WAY off to me..."
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2018,9/10,"This movie is worth the watch. Some say it was overtly political - and I would say to get over yourself. The plot was thoroughly engaging and the main characters developed in wholesome ways. The world building?? The scenery???? Beautiful. A feast for the eyes. If you can't handle political commentary, get over yourself. Not everyone gets to escape the thought of political happenings when they so choose. This is the future of movie making, and the past of movie making. Movies will always reflect our worlds situation, even if it is less obvious, context will always matter."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,5/10,"As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.
The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,4 September 2018,8/10,"Good storyline, Great actors! Visuals were stunning. Otherworldly, Atlantis on Land. If you enjoy the past, future, super heroes and scifi this is your kind of movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,10/10,"As I scroll through mixed reviews, I cannot see what people didn't enjoy about BLACK PANTHER. Every character was uniquely memorable, which is more than can be said for a lot superhero movies. They are all fantastic additions to the Marvel movie universe. Marvel triumphs with BLACK PANTHER, which beautifully blends elements from African and African-American culture into all the ingredients that make an amazing action film: a noble hero who has as much to prove to himself as others, a villian who is as charismatic as he is evil, and an alluring, magical setting complete with out-of-this-world technology. Plus, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and score, both of which I now listen to on my own time. I believed bad reviews to be accurate, until I actually went to see the movie and judge it for myself. I sat in the theater, completely engaged, waiting for the movie to get bad. However, it never did, and it kept me hooked til the last scene. I will watch it a thousand more times and still have my eyes glued to the screen."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,5/10,"Just watched this movie. While it made great attempts to be a great superhero movie, it misses a lot of the things other Marvel movies does great. The first thing that quite bothered me was the tribe aesthetics they wore, I understand that Wakanda is from Africa and they wanted to reflect that by using ancient tribe aesthetics but it does not work well with modern technology. They should have just stuck a modern style. Nothing wrong with Africans wearing modern suites. There is a significant amount of humour missing in the movie, I wish the amount of humour was more something like Thor Ragnarok. Cinematography and fight scenes were not all that amazing. Michael B. Jordan's character did not feel villainous enough. I truly hope they get a different director for the 2nd Black Panther movie."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,7/10,"I watched the Black Panther last night at my grandparents house excited to see my first Marvel Movie since Guardians Volume 2. It first began with me having high hopes for this movie, and I left feeling that this is definitely why I love Marvel. This is also my first time on the review page, so I was expecting a lot of great reviews about Black Panther. That was not the case. Many of these reviews called it ""another standard marvel movie"" or ""cliche"". Some of them even complained about the huge Black cast. For one thing, it is a backstory movie for the black panther before infinity war, as the only other time he showed up on the big screen was during Captain America: Civil War. We needed more about him so we have an understanding of his past. Well, now that that's over, let me get on with my review.Thank god that this movie knows how to make an easy to follow yet interesting story. The premise is basically that he becomes the new king of the technically advanced African nation, Wakanda, and must fight a terrorist organization that stole Vibranium from the nation, while figuring out his father's past. May I say it is pretty simple, but how it's portrayed is what makes it more entertaining. The acting was great, and also showed that strong, female roles can be done without making them the lead. Chadwick Boseman does great as T'Challa. The special effects and the portrayal of the Wakandan Capital are great. especially with the mountains shown in the background. My only problem was with the fight scene between Erik Killmonger and T'Challa for the battle of king, and Erik supposedly kills Black Panther. You knew that he had to live, because it would ruin the movie. It's very predictable in the end. Besides this, what faults does the movie have. I thought that every part of it was done well, and it deserves to be one of the better Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,22 April 2018,9/10,"This was a very well done superhero movie with lots of story lines. However, the car chase scene in Korea was boring and too much CGI, which is the problem in a lot of these action movies. There is no way anyone can drive like this IRL and not hit a pedestrian or a child or a bicycle and that turned me off. The scenes in Wcanda were beautiful, iI felt there could have been a bit more explanation given about the smart sister.
Very happy to see this many POC and women represented."
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2018,9/10,"This was a very interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked all of the actors. I don't like much CGI, which was a let down in the car chase in Korea, taking off a star in my review. Much better than Thor 2.. I liked the women beiing given greater responsibility in the plot...not just a love interest for the male star. 
BTW, I won't be going to see the new Avengers because the previous ones turned me off due to so much CGI and action at the expense of storytelling."
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2018,7/10,"It's an average super hero origin with a great villain (also a bit boring). I don't know why its got this much praise.
Some new tricks yes but nothing groundbreaking, and certainly not better than Nolan's Batman trilogy, avengers, infinity war or winter soldier."
BLACK PANTHER,12 November 2018,7/10,"Now, being a big fan of Marvel I usually give my Marvel movies sevens or eights. A few nines and one ten. But this movie. Its CGI was garbage *cough* war rhino *cough*. The two characters fighting each-other had the same powers (like we haven't seen that 1,000 times). I knew immediately that T'Challa would be fighting someone with revenge against him. Another take over the world scenario. Oh yeah, and political stuff! Like we don't see people talking about how racist white people are all the time. It gets really annoying. Why couldn't a black director for ONCE not make it about black people and just not teach anyone about political problems? Well whatever. I don't see how this movie can
be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. There were some good parts though. I liked Killmonger until he got too political. Shuri was pretty funny. Action was okay. But this ain't no good solo movie like Iron Man or Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Logan. In fact, I don't want people to even COMPARE it to Logan. Logan is much better. Well, whatever. It okay."
BLACK PANTHER,22 December 2018,4/10,"The very thought of Black Panther is enough to bring me to misery. The fact that so many people saw this film, had their senses assaulted by appalling CGI, a bland story and a one-dimensional villain masquerading as some sort of incredibly complex character and then walked out and thought they'd bared witness to the second coming of Christ is beyond me. The film has the emotional depth of a puddle and it's the same puddle I'd drown myself in after seeing the third act again."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2019,8/10,I loved the movie because the special effect it's so amazing .The sound was of really good quality and the video was enjoyable for the eye.There are a lot of talented and great principal actors such as Chadwick Boseman and Danai Gurira and there is a lot of action. I think however that the movie was too long because it lasts 2 hours.This movie is unbelievable ; it was literally the best movie ever ; but also it was the FIRST MARVEL movie which had a black principal actors and this is just incredible because I think it's a tribute to african-american culture and it was wonderful!
BLACK PANTHER,5 July 2019,4/10,"Can't believe it was candidated at the Oscars, this movie is the sum up of what politically correct is. Hyped and overrated as hell, boring and banal."
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2019,9/10,"Out of the blues this movie came and blewed all away.
I don't think ever the Marvel master Feige even thought about it that this will become a massive hit and cross a Billion.
In the flow of marvel everything is getting what there goodwill built up!"
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2019,1/10,This movie's plot is straight copied from Lion King. Very predictable.
BLACK PANTHER,12 October 2019,6/10,"I'm a fan of Marvel's films,I've been watching all of the films, and this is the weird one. I mean, this film felt just as a complement. As if this film must be made to fulfill characters, no matter if it's just not impressing at all. Sorry, but I must say that."
BLACK PANTHER,27 October 2020,2/10,"The only highlight in this otherwise run of the mill hero feature was Michael Jordan as Kilmonger. Seriously, poorly acted, poor storyline that is weak and is nothing out of the ordinary. Plus has a HUGE black pride agenda. I get it, it is in the title , but please don't force it down my throat. Boring. Predictable. Not even pleasant in its cinematography. Give it a miss, dont even need to see it for the MCU timeline."
BLACK PANTHER,14 November 2020,8/10,"Okay I understand that BLACK LIVES MATTER and all of that but that is no reason to make all of that noise to that very normal MCU movie and by the way I'm an African
Egyptian to be more precise before someone accuses me of racism"
BLACK PANTHER,24 July 2021,9/10,"You should definitely watch it , worth watching movie especially if you are a marvel fan. Acting was amazing by all actors, Nice story and action scenes."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,"Overrated/Overhyped piece of junk. I had high hopes. I at least thought this would be good enough to fit into the Marvel Universe. They have a standard for most of their movies but this just doesn't cut it. I couldn't get past the laughably bad acting, horrible CGI, and overall just stupid plot. Clearly the critics had their own agenda when they reviewed this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,29 February 2020,2/10,"Completely disregarding the history of CIA imperialism in 3rd world countries Black Panther depicts a white CIA agent as a hero, while the black revolutionary is a killmonger that must be put down. I can't believe people fall for it, and like bad movies like this. I guess you can't participate in Hollywood anymore unless you reinforce the status quo and establishment with insidious entertainment.The last scene of Black Panter extolls the beneficence of the United Nations. Because the UN did such a great job in Rawanda.Disney Marvel movies are the worst, turning out youth's mind into mush."
BLACK PANTHER,6 August 2018,1/10,"This ia one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Higly overrated and overhyped !!!.Don't bother to watch this movie, it's a waste of your time."
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2018,1/10,"God, this film is boring. Why scored so high? I think this film was way over hyped. I was looking forward to see this, and I am greatly disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2019,1/10,That certainly is 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,2/10,"Predictable story-line, over-acted, over-CGI-ed, just another lame Marvel movie with no edge. I think they need to start killing some of these ""superheroes"" off, there's seemingly a phone book full of them...
The movie's set in Waikonda (spelling probably wrong - cbf), a fictional african nation that has hidden its extreme wealth and technologically advanced society from the world with a hologram-forest net for decades... yeah, you know what, I'm just not going to go any further. It's a waste of time and just a really boring, deadpan superhero movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 August 2021,4/10,"Once I was done watching, it was like I hadn't just watched a movie. I got nothing out of it. It wasn't terrible, I would have gotten something out of that. It was just a neutral film, devoid of anything I could find entertainment in.I should state out of all of the marvel movies I've seen, which is close to all, I've enjoyed maybe 5. A lifelong comic fan I keep hoping I might eventually really like one.. but if you're not a fan of these generic disney factory blockbusters, like myself, Black Panther will be more of the same. It was massively overrated and I truly don't understand any hype for the actual movie itself.It's like so many other things... but to each their own!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,5/10,It was a good movie to kill the night with but far from the epic blockbuster I expected. The worst Iron Man was far better than this movie. Even G.I. Joe was more exciting and action packed.I wish I had read the realistic reviews here first so I wouldn't have felt so let down.I thought that it was much more important that there so many strong female roles in the movie than the fact that 99% of the cast was black. They were all good actors and did their roles justice but there just wasn't that much juice to the movie.I think that the 1 and 2 star ratings are vindictive and the movie deserves better than that but it also doesn't deserve the raves it received either.
BLACK PANTHER,30 June 2018,6/10,"I think people confuse their excitement for an all ""black cast"" and a story taking place in Africa, for a quality movie.
I found this one very mediocre compared to other Marvel movies. Perhaps my expectations was a bit high considering the hype from reviewers across the pond.:) 
-Some talented actors. 
-Some interesting world building. 
-Can never be too much Angela Bassett in any movie.:( 
-The storyline isn't very original. 
-The FX are right out laughable, those 3D rhinos had me laughing out loud and the fighting scenes at the end was not up to standards (rubbery and weightless game style 3D from the 90s).
-The magic tech used in the movie was way too advanced, being able to make anything out of thin air is just too convenient and makes your hero and story unexciting.Just got a general meeeeh feeling about it all. There are other better superhero movies out there...or ""black cast"" movies if thats what you are looking for."
BLACK PANTHER,11 December 2019,6/10,I saw Slumdog Millionaire as Hollywood goes India or India goes Hollywood and I see Black Panther as Hollywood goes Africa or Africa goes Hollywood. The values sold in this film are no different than the values sold in a slew of Hollywood action films. It has value in that it gives North American people of African decent heroes in their own image which is all the more important in today's socio-political reality.
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,3/10,"This movie was trash, I heard it was different than the other terrible Marvel movies but it was the same."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"Man o man, i cant say how disappointed i have been after watching this movie. Let me tell you that after Thor Ragnarok, i was way too excited to see the next MARVEL movie... Black panther was one of the new ones that i was looking forward to but i tell you, what disappointment it turned out to be.Without spoilers, let me tell you, there is absolutely nothing that will make you stun or surprised or praise anything that you have not already watched in the trailer. Actually the trailer of this movie had almost all the cool scenes and thats it.NO action... just a mess all around. No integrity what so ever.. a 100% predictable movie from the first 5 mins. an over stretch of a first 2 mins of movie. THIS IS THE ONLY SUPER HERO MOVIE THAT I DID NOT EVEN WAITED TO SEE THE END OF CREDIT SCENES... !! Imagine how it boggled my brain... I had to come home and see Captain America - Civil War all again. Just to keep the Black Panther in saw in civil war, to keep that as his memory in my head and not this crappy s**t i saw ... There is something really wrong with the ratings now a days. I am surprised how such junk movies are being hyped till maximum.. I seriously have lost all faith on Critics and ratings... That is now all a business and game.. In last few years, soo many good movies have been dumped by critics and so many crappy movies have been hyped up the roof... What a shame.."
BLACK PANTHER,29 September 2018,5/10,"With the hyper and almost 100 percent critics approval that came with the movie, I had my expectations up. I have to say there is a huge discrepancy between what the movie actually is and how it was portrayed in the media. The action, acting and story is mediocre at best. Most critics were simply afraid to criticize this movie with the fear of being branded a racist and bigot. The movie was literally taken as a triumph for African americans. Not sure if this movie has anything to do with reality but certainly not what i expected to see. I think Marvel needs to stop coming up with more and more and more movies like Ant man, wasp and now captain marvel This greed needs to stop."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,9/10,"The greatness of the Black Panther movie is in what it makes you feel for your culture as an African, especially the potential for greatness, long after the the credits are done. 
It won't go down as the best CGI manipulated movie or best action sequence, not even greatest acting in the Marvel jaggernaut. However what this movie has done that the others have failed is to lend a cultural vibrance and a sense of belonging, especially to Africans in our homeland (I'm from Kenya), and to see the greatness of our continent if it's resources were harnessed and used well. Yes it has political undertones, anti-colonial sentiment which of course triggers the race debate (which is where I suspect many reviewers got salty), but that's the point of BP. Of you read about his character as well from the comic books, he isn't a ""fit"" in the Avengers and has always been suspicious of the rest, as his first priority is protecting Wakanda.
So, anyine watching this expecting just wham, bam and cheesy, predictable plots with no undertones, this isn't for you. 9/10 movie for me."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2019,1/10,"I enjoy all the other Marvel movies I've seen, so I expected this to be the same. Quite the opposite, I feel bored to death.
The first 25 mins probably can be done for less than half of the time. I spaced out constantly and when going back to it I realized I almost didn't miss anything.
So many redundant trash talk, taunting and declaration... On the half way it's already drained all my patience.
Such a bad one."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2018,6/10,"Black Panther was pretty good. Entertaining, but definitely doesn't live up to all the hype. I'm sick of being told by critics what movies I should like. And I'm even sicker of people saying you're racist for not liking a movie like this one. But, to bash a movie that you haven't seen is even dumber. It is a sad commentary on the world we live in. It's definetly not the worst marvel film, but not the best either. It is definitely worth a watch."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,3/10,I have been a Marvel/DC buff since I was a kid and I had wanted to like the movie so much but it was a disappointment for me. The fighting scenes reminded me of Troy's and the dialogues are not well written. The special effects are excellent though
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,3/10,"I have been a Marvel/DC buff since I was a kid. Spent hours poring over my uncle's comics on a daily basis since I was 7 years old and been waiting for this movie for eons. I watched the trailer and was impressed by it and couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. The verdict: It was a disappointment. I wanted to like it so much but I just couldn't 
The stars of this movie are all very attractive but the quality of the acting isn't up to par. Even an academy award winner N'yongo couldn't connect with her co-stars
The characters lacked depth and there was no chemistry between any of them. Even between the King and his mother, and the King and Nakia. The fight scene's script between Killmonger and T'Challa when the former challenged him for the throne, was taken from Troy's fight scenes between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Achilles. The movie is visually breathtaking but they could've done better with the script and storyline."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,3/10,"I love marvel movie! Really I do!
But this time Marvel has nothing special to offer.
As you consider this movie as MCU banner ( Marvel cinematic universe) this movie has nothing unique. Or at least regular one. If you have seen all the trailers, you have already seen all the fights.
Fight (2/10)
Graphics (8/10)
Story (4/10)
Starcast (3/10)And believe me no more connectinon is established between this movie and Infinity wars. And last stone is still missing even after all the post credit scenes. And if you has seen Civil war, last post credit scene is about Bucky. Almost same one. And another mid credit scene is also near as civil war UN conference.My some MCU ratings are mentioned here maybe for your reference.
Thor Ragnarok 9/10
Age of ultrons 9/10
Iron man 2 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Throughout most of Black Panther, the central political antagonism is one between non-violent nativist isolationism (represented by T'Challa and his ruling-class cohort) and pan-African anti-colonial revolutionary struggle (represented by N'Jadaka/Erik Stevens).The problem with this antagonism is that N'Jadaka, the radical revolutionary and the primary antagonist, is also portrayed as a warmongering maniac (fueled by childhood trauma and motivated by vengeance) who wants to rule over the world. N'Jadaka wants to play the colonizer's game against themselves and replace white hegemony with black hegemony. In this respect, the film, being a thoroughly ideological product, eagerly conflates radical struggle with totalitarian ambitions. Although it tries to make the audience sympathize with N'Jadaka's motivations, its ideological message is clear enough - political radicalism is a psychological pathology that must be defeated.Towards the end, T'Challa changed his mind and no longer believes in a nativist approach to an increasingly interconnected ""multicultural"" (read: global capitalist) world. So what does the film end on? A reformist and assimilationist politics combined with a bland and complacent liberal humanism. Let's build social outreach centers in black neighborhoods without challenging the political and economic mechanisms that make structural inequality and mass incarceration possible. Let's share our resources with the world, sing Kumbaya at the UN and forget about the systematic exploitation of Third World workers and the endless imperialist wars fought in service of global finance capital. Let's uphold bourgeois peace and defeat those ""crazy"" radicals. Let's ignore the institutions and the people who are actually responsible for large-scale human suffering and just hold everyone's hands and celebrate our ""shared humanity"". Is it surprising that all this ideological garbage is coming out of a mainstream Hollywood superhero film? Not at all.For all the ""smart"" political commentaries and metaphors, Black Panther is ultimately steeped in the same hegemonic logic that it pretends to challenge. Black liberation is and has always been about struggling against deeply oppressive colonial and imperialist regimes. All this history of antagonism is conveniently erased in favor of a comfortable, feel-good bourgeois humanism."
BLACK PANTHER,20 May 2021,2/10,"So. There is a super rich, super technologic and beautiful african nation who is totally closed and let die thier neighbors african nations. What is the message? Selfishness ? We are rich and cool but others can go to hell."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,10/10,"In my honest opinion, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is crazier than Heath Ledger's Joker portrayed in the Dark Knight Trilogy. Yes; Heath Ledger; Ledger is a better actor than Jordan but the characters master-plans are at two different levels. The Joker wants to see Gotham burn as a crazed way of getting into Batman's head while Killmonger wants revenge against his father's murderer along with revenge against Caucasian-Western-Society for its colonial mind-state.I found it surprising that people liked Heath Ledger's Joker but still saw him as crazy while people also like Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger yet see him as relatable. Does the above observation say something about our racial-climate here in America? Killmonger is crazy-point,...blank, ...period. You never fight fire with fire. Revenge accomplishes nothing. I knew that revenge accomplished nothing ever since I read Moby Dick in high-school. None-the-less, there are countless youth going around embracing Killmonger as the star of Black Panther.The real stars of Black Panther are the good guys."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,3/10,"Lead actors studying at the Yale School of Drama or coming from London England, that would explain the really bad accents and the poor portrayal. There were times when the leader of the Gorilla tribe sounded like Bane from Batman Dark Knight Rises.
Aside from the poor accents the story dragged in places and rushed through others so left an incomplete story. Martin Freeman looked totally out of place as a CIA pilot ace and if nothing else it demonstrated that when the Americans arrived the shit hit the fan. Really poor movie that could have been done so much better. I had high hopes for this one."
BLACK PANTHER,26 January 2019,5/10,"First off, I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and a HUGE Black Panther fan, so I was really excited for this movie. Unfortunately, pretty much everything fell short of expectation. Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was my own desire for it to be the next Ragnarok, but BP was far from it. I completely realize the cultural significance of the film, but I'm going to just focus on the movie itself, as I think the critics should have.As far origin stories go, Black Panther has one of the more unique and interesting pasts. No radioactive spiders or aliens from a different dimension, just a fresh story with a ton of potential that was, unfortunately, wasted. I really wish the movie would have taken more time to focus on T'Challa BECOMING Black Panther and the personal struggles that surrounded it instead of focusing so much on Killmonger. While I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger, I felt the character itself was written a bit too one-dimensional, with no real development over the film.Next the CGI....ugh. Given the GAGILLIONS of dollars that Marvel puts into it's movies, there were some real issues with a few of the CGI scenes. Wakanda itself was beautiful, but a few of the action scenes really jumped the shark for me, especially with the war rhinos. That scene in-and-of-itself was enough to really stain the movie, but it was not the only one.Lastly, the writing and acting felt a little stale. I realize that Wakanda is a monarchy that has been shut off from the outside world, so their social interactions would be different than the rest of society, but I still felt that they could have added a little flair to the dialogue and personality to the acting. Outside of Letitia Wright's portrayal of T'challa's sister, who's dialogue and performance really saved a lot of scenes, there was a lot of missed potential to create characters with a little more personality.Overall, Black Panther was a miss, but there is still opportunity for redemption! As we saw with the first two Thor films, which were far more terrible, it is possible to come back to the same characters from a new perspective and really make something special. Unfortunatley, with the box office success of Black Panther, I fear that the studio will approach the subsequent films using the exact same formula, and we'll get more of the same."
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2018,1/10,"I simply could not get the slightest Idea what this movie ia about, and more importantly, why it was made in the first place.A major waste of time, material and effort to produce a chemical-free sleeping-aide,l i would decribe that move.Despite many espressos and best intentions, i could not stay awake. I rarely have movies i don't like this much, but this one qualifies.Safe your money, electricity 7 battery-charge and more inportantly your time, watch something else."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"Critics have praised it, given it a perhaps unwarranted hype. Let's not forget that this still remains an origins story, which means that it is not a Hollywood re - shaping movie. Well, maybe not in the way most people expect. -- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --
First of all, if you are a person who loved Guardians of the Galaxy 2, you might as well just skip ahead and don't watch this one. It is not goofy, it is not simple, it does actually have a good plot and a better script. I am sure you understand by now to what type of people I am referring to.The movie sets right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where t' Chakka, king of Wakanda, has been murdered in a terrorist attack. As the king, his children must take succession to the throne, a thing his elder son, T challa (aka the Black Panther) has been groomed and raised to take for years. All goes well, the traditions are carried throughout the obscure kingdom, and t' Challa successfully earns his place as the King. Wakanda survives off the technological advantages their most precious natural resource, vibranium, has given them, and the powers of the King himself. When, however, a notorious terrorist possesses some of the precious vibranium, and cooperates with a mysterious young man, who has a vindictive agenda of his own against Wakanda, the Black Panther must rise to the occasion, and prove to be a King unlike his predecessors, with the necessary sacrifices and changes to old traditions.You can nitpick every little thing you want just to satisfy your craving to bash this movie. You may mock the accents, scoff at the socio-political cape of the movie, or claim that ""it wasn't as you expected it"". In the end, however, it remains as one of the most well rounded origin stories, similar to the first Spider Man and the Iron Man, with a simple yet carefully crafted story around a character who was born from the social injustice many wouldn't want to see in a heroic movie. Tough for you. Besides, while the racial differences may be the fuel behind the antagonist's actions, they do not gloss over the aspects of a Marvel film. The action sequences are very well choreographed. The soundtrack couldn't have been better, as Ludwig Goransson glorifies and honours traditional African music and songs. Lastly, the cast itself is sublime, full of known and new actors who meld wonderfully to their characters, whether they are a traditional warrior or an outcast with a vengeance. Chadwick Boseman (t' challa/Black Panther) plays and moves well beyond his 40 years of age, and portrays emotion in a moving way when faced with tough decisions. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is an excellent ""Grace Jones"" lookalike in the form of a warrior, and she presents herself wonderfully in battle and in peace. Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia) gracefully graces Boseman's side and acts as the link to tradition and modern times, while Letitia Wright (Shuri) steals the show as the comic relief genius, who is ready to assist in anyway she can. Last but certainly not least, Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger) gives a great dimension to an otherwise typical villain, and even though he follows the classic revenge scenario, he does so with a way and a persuading performance that you can't help but understand his motives and even support his way of thinking; his last scene is especially powerful.It's not groundbreaking, certainly, but it's one of the best origin stories out there, offering an entertaining time as it crafts and moulds a nation and a character very different from the others, under an idea that could have easily escalated at the hands of another director. Ryan Coogler does not let the self righteousness drape over the core of this movie, and the result is a wonderful tribute to tradition, racial respect and the eternal message that hatred is never the way to go if you want to prove yourself right."
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2018,6/10,"I was slightly let down by thia movie, my expectations weren't very high but I still expected more than this. I'm gonna start off on a high note with the positives. First of all this movie is largely very well paced, you can easily define each act of the movie which aided in storytelling. The characters were all quite enjoyable and fit there roles especially the titular character, Chadwick Boseman felt so natural and comefortable in T'Challa. Fun additions to the cast were Andy Serkis and Letita Wright. The film was shot very well, I enjoyed the cinematography and it featured more vibrant colours than I would've expected. Unfortunately where this movie loses it's steam is in the script, it consistentaly put the characters into positions which lead to a predictable story, there were so many things that I knew were gonna happen before they did, not too many twists and turns to keep things interesting. Another thing that bothered me was the unrealistic technology, it consumed most of the action sequences with, ""hey look at this cool thing"", tech played an important part in the script but the unbelievability of it just took me right out of the story. The dialogue was also very campy from time to time and not in a self aware kind of way. The character motivations don't always make sense, I felt the conflict wasn't properly resolved by the end. And the action scenes took a dive into ""lazy cgi punchfests"" so to speak, I thought we were over that, especially after the scathing reviews this film recieved. I'm honestly shook this film has such a high metascore, I really don't believe it's that good. The positives are there I just think it suffers from a fair bit."
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2018,9/10,"An interesting movie, with a very different and thought-provoking balance between tribal African tradition/culture and modern technology and thinking. The movie does a great tribute to African culture that they have African dancing, songs, language, and honor for loving one's people. I loved the action, especially the great choreographed fighting by the Black Panther. King T'Challa is very mature, as very much seen in Captain America: Civil War, where he refuses to take revenge upon his father's murderer. It is there we are introduced to the mature hero that I feel Marvel needs. I seriously think Black Panther, along with Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor give a moral foundation for this Marvel storyline.What I loved most however was that the movie called all of us humans, though mostly black people in my opinion, to let go of resentment from the past and elect to help others even if you may not gain from doing so. King T'Challa at the end of the movie addresses the United Nations, and boldly states that it is his and his country's goal to represent how all humans should treat others, by building relationships and forgiving one another, by thinking like one tribe. This is powerful stuff!! Tribalism plagues our world, in real life as well as the Marvel movies, dividing the Americans from the Middle East, the superheroes from each other, black people from the rest of the world as Erik Killmonger was preaching to the Wakandans when he killed T'Challa and became king.Does encouraging black people to kill white people, to kill everyone who is ""lesser"" to them or who enslaved them solve the problems of resentment and tribalism in the world? No. It continues the cycle of hatred that we are all stuck in. I'm sorry if it is too bold to say, but all people including black people need to imagine themselves as one tribe, the human tribe, and let go of any resentments holding them back, as Black Panther rallies everyone to do at the end of this movie.I loved that message and really give major props to this movie for boldly saying that we humans can and need to create one global family, one tribe, or we will all perish and kill each other.Great movie, I recommend anyone to see it."
BLACK PANTHER,30 January 2021,10/10,One of the best movies in the MCU and packed with a lot of good actors/actress. People wo rate this movie below 6 don't know what the movie is about and don't like the all black cast. Incredibly heartbreaking. May he Rest in Peace. He was beyond amazing accomplishing everything that he did all while battling cancer. That speaks volumes about the type of man he was. Few people could've done what you did and even fewer could've done it with such strength. Wakanda Forever
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2019,4/10,"The costumes were nice. So if you are a person who really enjoys movies based on visuals like costume design, then it's probably a movie that you'll like.
The music was also fine. Not brilliant, but definitely above average.However.The story was unimaginative, illogical and plain boring. The pacing was terrible and the things that were supposed to be exciting were predictable and lame.
The acting was bad and the characters were ridiculous. Most of the time the movie felt like a school play. Seriously. I think most actors are probably quite good actors, but the writing (and possibly also the directing) was horrible so they came off like complete amateurs.Overall the movie was nice to look at but completely uninteresting.
If you are 10 years old or if you are interested in costume design this might be a movie for you. Otherwise the only reason for watching the movie is if you just HAVE to see all Marvel movies. It's not extremely bad, but it's in the bottom three of Marvel movies out there."
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2020,7/10,"After learning the heartbreaking news, I wanted to watch this film again from a different perspective. I can't emphasize young black people but I can definitely understand that Black Panther is a symbol, symbol of standing-up against racism. That's why I think that the ideology behind this film is much more important than the movie itself. You lightened a candle that gives hope to people about victory, accomplishments do not seek race. Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman. Rest in peace Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Ryan Coogler. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), shortly after the events of Civil War. He takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced city that is hidden in Africa. He quickly faces challenges though, as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), comes for the throne.The best aspect of the film is Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler creates an authentic setting that is full of vibrant colors, beautiful scenery, fascinating culture, and advancements in technology. There are some beautiful shots in the film that are complimented by the excellent color choice. The culture is truly fascinating from its great costumes to its interesting traditions. There is also a nice contrast within the culture, of old and new. While Wakanda is constantly innovating, it stays grounded in it's old and unique traditions. Wakanda's advancements in technology are fun to watch, whether it's in action sequences or the daily lifestyles of a Wakandan. This is world-building at its finest. Coogler gives us an authentic world that feels lived in, compared to other settings in the MCU like Asgard from the Thor franchise.The action sequences can be best described as fluent. These sequences are fast-paced and well choreographed. The Wakandan technology makes these sequences exciting. These are simply some of the most entertaining sequences ever seen in the MCU.Chadwick Boseman gives you that slick and intelligent character that is expanded upon in the film.The chemistry is great, especially in the four main protagonists. T'Challa and each member of his crew have believable relationships and each character serve their own purpose within his crew. Letitia Wright's Shuri and T'Challa have a dynamic relationship, where they actually feel like siblings. She also accounts for most of the comic relief in the film. Danai Gurira's Okoye is an all business character that is loyal to her king. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia. While she is mostly there as T'Challa's love interest, she has her own set of goals that adds another layer to her character, as well as T'Challas.The character that really steals the show is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. His character has powerful and clear motivations, that some might even find relatable. This makes his character conflicting for the viewer as they choose between him and T'Challa. While most villains in the MCU suffer from being poorly written, Killmonger has some great scenes that build up his character and give his character a legitimate purpose that most MCU villains lack. Killmonger even causes T'Challa to question himself, which is the mark of a great villain. Yet he still felt like he didn't get enough screen time and some of the scenes in this film could have easily been replaced with scenes that give more insight into his character.The film had few negatives, but they're worth talking about. This film lacks emotional moments. Without the emotional moments, this film lends itself as a very predictable one. The film does have social commentary and some political agendas. The political agendas take the form of two lines though. The lines still feel like they were throw in there and just felt unnecessary in a Marvel film.Overall, Black Panther is unlike any Marvel experience I have ever had. This film definitely feels like a Marvel film, but it separates itself from its predecessors. Coogler creates an authentic setting that has a lot going for it. The film boasts great effects, action sequences, and cinematography. The film has excellent main and supporting characters. Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date but still didn't get enough screen time. The film is predictable and has some unnecessary political agendas. Like I said, Black Panther is a unique experience. One that certainly should be experienced in the theaters. My score: 8.0/10"
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,1/10,Worst marvel movie yet... it's slow and dull with poor dialogue and wooden acting.People say Solo & The Last Jedi 'ruined' Star Wars but this movie is more painful than a 2 hour Jar Jar backstory.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Well first of all lower your expectations: this is not THE BEST Marvel movie but keeps up the bar set by the Captain America ones. This is not a movie that will ""redeem the african culture"" as hyped in media, as it's more of the same MCU showed so far in terms of script. So yeah the main cast is black, and they're impressive at it: the script doesn't cartoon them like other films in the past but, c'mon, they might as well be Sakaarians, they still feel like comic book characters.This is a love song, not a warsong. The movie is both personal and consistent with the universe Marvel created, and there's nothing wrong with that unless you hate superhero comics in general. It's no more politically loaded than The Winter Soldier and Civil War were, as it just scrapes world issues the presence of superheroes and supervillains would both benefit and harm. The script is not the strong point, though it's also not bad, and it gives as in all MCU movies much respect for its characters than even the comics did.So what's the strong point? Those freaking visuals again! The movie, as most of the MCU, is GORGEOUS. I foresee most Oscars going to the visual department, and I hope it wins at Best Costume Design. As i said, this movie is a love song and it shows in all the little details that make part of the Wakandan setting. Busan and London don't look scrappy either, and Oakland (from where the director hails) is dignified by it.It's kinda sad the strongest political message came, again as in many movies, from the villain. I suppose many who wanted to politicize (pro or against) this film were expecting ""dem truths"" dropped like mics, but it's usually the unfettered, the ""evil"" who says those words and this film didn't disappoint in that aspect. Sooo... does that mean they're ""evil"" statements? Does it take to be amoral to say what the african-american people want to say?As good the actors were, the main characters were a little bland except for the scene stealer MAH MAN M'BAKU. He was both strong and hilarious. There was so much that could've be done with Forrest Whitaker but hasn't, because all the young actors carried the movie in their shoulders and among them Winston Duke was the MVP. I somehow wish he was king but at least he got a much better limelight than in the comics."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,5/10,"I generally like Marvel movies. They've had a low point recently, with Civil War, which I didn't like, but with Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, I really felt like they started to improve and balance their humour and good story well.
Based on the trailer for Black Panther, I did not like the movie from the start. The trailer was awful. Then the ratings came out, and I thought that maybe I was wrong. People called it the next Avatar. But I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre after I realized that all the reviews were talking about were the ""diversity"" of the movie.
And- it turns out I was right. This movie is awful. The story is cliched and forgettable, the characters are standard except that John Watson guy, and it's awfully paced and boring. Nothing stands out. It's been a few months now and nobody is talking about this movie anymore... well, maybe about the black diversity thing, but not the actual movie quality itself. Hmmm. I wonder why. Probably because this movie is **%#%%, and all the critics are scared that they'll be called racist if they don't like it.
I mean, an 88, really? That's just ridiculous. I've always trusted metacritic, but this must be a joke. I want to see all these critics watch this movie again in thirty years and see how much they like it.
Yeah- this is what happens when you involve social politics in movies. Movies are an art, not a platform. And this movie is like a kindergardener's drawing."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,8/10,"Wow!I love to read these low point crybaby reviews. They say it is boring, average acting etc etc. DO NOT LISTEN to them!
They are babies, they don't pay attention what happens on screen when there is no fight going on. Of course they are getting bored. They woud like to see a Black Panther movie like 90 minutes about hero fighting ANYONE.They right however, this film is not an average Marvel movie, however i would use the word BETTER, not worse. What I really like that side characters have been built up better than any previous Marvel movie before. Strong acting, but it is true that the lead character should have been better.
Wakanda representation was also OK for a 120min movie which is not a documentary film. This film also give time for such serious questions like migrants, technology sharing, moral decisions.The villain has clear motivations and they found an excellent actor for the role.Actions scenes are pretty good, although i have to mention the CGI had some quality issues, luckily only few times.I recommend to watch this film, but only if you don't want more than a popcorn superhero movie with more fight, less explanation"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,5/10,"Black Panther makes an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016). From then, with don't know much about him or where he is from, although we expect that there is a lot more that we don't know about him when we see him wearing his fantastic suit.Back then, there were mysteries. Who's this guy? How did he make the suit? Why is he so powerful and fast? Where does he come from?Basically, all we get is something along: ""Ahah! We've got vibranium! So we are intelligent, and here you were.. all thinking we were dumb and poor - nope!""How does vibranium make you smarter? How do you melt and manipulate this peculiar metal? After 30 minutes, you've seen everything the movie has to offer. I wish I had the same surprise as when I watched Ant-Man, but I didn't. I didn't laugh, didn't find the sceneries impressive (CGI), they failed the serious tone by using the same formula the Arrow series is using all the time."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2019,10/10,"I loved this insertion of Marveldom Mastery! Whether or not one has read the comic or not, one cannot help but be entertained.
Oscar worthy, certainly not, not even sure why it got the nomination."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2019,7/10,I expected him to be like he was in civil war. Instead he was just bland.
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,6/10,"It's a pretty average movie. Nothing too exciting, some terrible jokes were said, but some scenes were good."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,5/10,"Be warned: If you watch this movie with high expectations based on media buzz and reviews you will be really disappointed. It's a Marvel fantasy action flick without depth, just like all the others. Actually it's Iron Man reborn as an African King, nothing more. If you believe to have found an important message for mankind, or parts of it, you're reading something into it which simply is not there. For sure the makers of this movie were the ones most surprised of what viewers believed to have found in this film. Even worse, if you really wanted to find a message, then it carries a message of anti-democracy. I should have known better since whenever the American mainstream believes to have found something of cultural significance, it's most likely BS. Hollow through and through, but entertaining enough to watch it to the end, hence 5 stars. Unfortunately it left me disappointed, but this only because of the undeserved high expectations."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"If you are a fan of superhero movies, then you will get exactly what you come for when you pay to watch this movie. Everything in this movie just feels like it came straight from a checklist, but if you are okay with that, then this movie is fine. When I left the theater, I felt apathetic. I wasn't disappointed but I certainly wasn't surprised. As I said, you get what you come for. If you care about specifics, keep reading, if not, just know that it is like every other Marvel movie.Plot: If you saw a trailer or even read the IMDB plot synopsis, you have spoiled the movie for yourself. 5 minutes into the movie you can guess where the plot will go, beat by beat. There are no twists, no turns, just your formulaic safe ""go here, beat some guys up, talk, go there, beat some guys up, talk, etc."" If you are fine with a predictable plot (will the main character die 15 minutes into the movie?! What?! He doesn't!) then this is the movie for you.Effects: While the art design for this movie is frankly beautiful, the effects are far from. The whole movie feels like it was shot on green screen and some effects are cringe worthy. I am talking about PS2 cutscene levels of bad. Nothing feels real and there is no tension in anything. Characters, pacing, cinematography, basically everything else:The characters are 2 dimensional (the stoic main character, funny smart girl, stoic bodygaurd, wack villain, serious villain who is the antithesis of the main protagonist). The style is ""marvel movie"". Take it or leave it. Politics?:There seems to be a misconception that this movie in any way deals with politics. While that is technically true, the issues are handled wit the grace of ""should we kill all white people?"" ""probably not"". There are so many political issues addressed by this movie, isolationism, racism, traditions, etc. but all of them are presented in the fashion of ""(insert topic here) is (good/bad)"". It makes no statement that a 10 year old couldn't also make. In all it is far from a bad movie, just incredibly bland."
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2018,5/10,"It is mediocre. Everything is mediocre; the plot, the acting, the effects, the main character, the villan, everything. Even this review. Mediocre."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,2/10,If you want a black Super Hero just watch Blade. This movie is like a broken pencil... Pointless!
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"This movie was a little bit different from the previous marvel films, though its not a bad film, they still managed to make it good. the visuals were great but in my opinion the story is just...meh. the villain was great and probably one of the best villains in the mcu, the performance is also great, character development is great but after that, it feels like just another normal superhero movie. but the film has its moments, there are a lot of scenes that are just really great, action sequences are well choreograph like the long one shot in the movie. but what's amazing in this movie is the visuals, the story may be not that good, but the characters and visuals and action sequences just make this movie not bad.overall it's an enjoyable movie"
BLACK PANTHER,6 September 2021,5/10,I hate going to the office and had to tell people I love this movie. It just felt like politically incorrect to say that. A weird world we live in right?
BLACK PANTHER,6 December 2018,6/10,"The only reason this movie gets so much praise is do to its cast. If you disregard the fact this is the ""first African American"" superhero film (even though Blade has four films), this movie is mediocre schlock with yet another MCU villain with great potential but no follow through. The film does have some pretty epic fight scenes such as the fight in the Asian Club but other than a couple of cool choreographed scenes, this movie has nothing special to it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,"I saw Black Panther yesterday, having not seen any trailers and not really knowing much about it, and I absolutely loved it! I've been a little disappointed with most of the recent Marvel films so I wasn't sure what I'd think of this one but I was pleasantly surprised.Black Panther follows the story of King T'Challa of Wakanda, a hidden African nation filled with advanced technology, and his battle to protect his country.This film was obviously a huge step forward in diversity. The cast is mostly black and the women are refreshingly not stereotypical and not over sexualised. It's so nice to see women portrayed as smart, political, and strong but with complex emotions and ambitions rather than being portrayed simply as the romantic interest or the warrior.I thought that the story was brilliant. In the past, Marvel has not shied away from making political statements in their films and this was no different. There were moments that moved me to tears, the characters were likeable and well-developed, and the plot was clever, believable and well paced. The visuals in this film were absolutely stunning. The use of colour, in particular, really helped to establish the beauty of the country of Wakanda. The costumes were vibrant and the special effects were amazing.It did have a bit of a different feel to a lot of the Marvel films. This was potentially due, in part, to the fact that it was mostly separate from the previously established world of The Avengers. Most of the recent Marvel films have included cameos of various members of The Avengers or other well-established Marvel characters whereas Black Panther did not. Since T'Challa had already been introduced in Civil War, there was no need to connect this too strongly with The Avengers. To me it felt enough like it was part of the univere but a little secluded, like Wakanda.My only real issue with Black Panther was that the humour fell a little flat. It felt like an awkward dad trying to be ""down with the kids"". This was particularly disappointing as Marvel films often have the perfect balance of action, emotion and comedy whereas it just didn't work in this film. Overall though I immediately fell in love with this film and I cannot wait to see how it links in to the rest of the Marvel universe in Avengers: Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"One of the movies we most hoped for and was worth the hype all over.
For a source film I want to highlight the various action scenes and the characters behind this great movie.
Spectacular action scenes, surrounded by a fantastic soundtrack, made by Kendrick Lamar.
The mood is well placed and only used in the most appropriate parts.
Unlike the other Marvel movies, the characters demonstrate a certain charisma, in the case of Martin Freeman, who does a good job. The main character is still learning about everything and this is notorious throughout the film, something that is transmitted to the viewer. The villain is represented with a particular motivation, which causes the spectator to divide in certain parts, doubting if he should support the hero or the villain. But, the best of the film, are the women, the protectors of Wakanda and the king's family.
In short, Marvel was right in another movie that will belong to my top 3.I was not surprised that this movie could be nominated for one or more Oscars, one of better characterization and the other of better photography.WAKANDAFOREVER!!"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2019,1/10,"Worst marvel movie that i have ever seen, and I am a marvel fanatic, but this one is really bad, can't believe that got nominated to best picture instead of infinity war, the Oscars are a joke"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,4/10,"Black Panther is one of the most boring and forgettable MCU films since ""Thor: The Dark World"" . I'm not a racist, and i'm not getting paid off by DC or some crap like that. No one pays me. I just thought the movie was moronic and boring on a technical and personal level. Everything besides the music and the color pallet is painfully average. And it stunned me how people are acting as if this is a political thriller. This is another Marvel movie that is about one guy going in a black wunzie and beating up some guy with a bad motivation. It has a 97% on rotten tomatoes. People and including and especially critics are saying this is better that the best superhero movies like The Dark Knight (Which is one of the best movies of all time by the way) and Superman (1978). The humor is incredibly cringe worthy and awkward. The villains motivation is completely basic. All the characters have no complexity at all. It isn't nearly as good as the best MCU films like Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 (2017) or Iron Man (2008). It is just very average. I give it a 4/10"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Never read a Black Panther comic? No need to worry! This movie covers all the bases on how every Black Panther (passed down from generation to generation) acquires their powers and the throne. Chadwick Boseman does an incredible job at playing the hero who struggles with leading an entire nation differently than his father did. The whole cast of colorful and skilled characters really make the story pop as there are elements of love, loss, drama, action, and comedy all throughout the film. You'll adore how it connects to previous MCU movies and Stan Lee's small cameo once again entertains! The villain has his reasons for being bad which we come to understand as an audience and his softer sides round out the ending quite nicely. See for yourself! Everyone brought their A-game in Black Panther and the visuals are so flipping cool!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2018,8/10,"We're there flaws? Sure. Did I follow all of the logic?No. but it was highly entertaining, and I loved seeing all the strong, female warriors and gorgeous black men. The tech was interesting if not very believable, but, hey, who would have predicted portable Video/phone/camera/reading/messaging devices 30 years ago? Suspend disbelief and be swept away to Wakanda! It's a great ride! Disney? Can you make this happen?"
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2019,5/10,"The movie was OK, but it was really overrated. My wife raved about it but me not so much."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,4/10,"I felt like there was nothing special about this film. It had great special effects and fight choreography, which is what I come to expect from Marvel, but the actual plot was just so shallow, and I was never really reeled in."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,10/10,"Ignore the bad reviewers, they've got issues. Great story, characters, acting and action. While not perfect, (what is?) it could've been a tad shorter, it's got a lot of great emotional moments and some well timed humor. Looking forward to seeing these characters in future Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,10/10,"This movie has it all, Great acting , action, effects , costumes, music and scenery. Above all it's an entertaining story which is both dramatic and as with most Marvel movies plenty of humor. While the story stands on it's own seeing Captain America civil war 1st is helpful."
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2019,10/10,"This film redefined the superhero genre. Everywhere from the music to the action sequences. The film also redefined Hollywood and shattered both expectations and stereotypes with its primarily black cast. The movie also added some cultural and societal references that made everyone question the society we live in.
The cinematography was spectacular. The film makers blended traditional african clothing and culture with futuristic technology to create a world that seemed both tangible and out of reach. The acting was phenomenal. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent job portraying T'Challa, who is conflicted with his traditional values and what he'd experienced in the rest of the world. Michael B. Jordan definitely stole the show as Erik Killmonger. His superb portrayal of the sympathetic antagonist left audiences with both tears and cheers. Letitia Wright also added some excellent comic relief as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The film score by Ludwig G√∂ransson was perfect. He blended traditional african music with modern day hip-hop to bring both Wakanda and its characters to life. The plot was phenomenal. There were many plot twists that kept the story rolling and the strife between the conflicted T'Challa and determined Killmonger added a lot of depth to the story. The cultural and social references that intertwined with the story related with the audience to make them feel they were part of the story, and that the story was a part of them. Black Panther is a film worthy of praise and will forever be one of the top movies of the century."
BLACK PANTHER,28 December 2018,1/10,It was boring. The humor wasn't even good it felt like they were reading from a script. I liked the African elements but overall it was so boring and predictable
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,3/10,"Going into this film, I had hopes that this movie would be good. However, it was not. It was the complete opposite.
The movie made no point. It was completely aimless. It's just CGI, explosions, one liners, prolonged fight scenes and nothing else."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2019,8/10,"I do not like Marvel movies, save for the first Iron Man. So I was a little reluctant to see this one, but I am glad I did! It does not 'seem' like a superhero movie to me. The plot and back stories are excellent, and it was well casted. Of course it does have some cheesy moments, but that was expected. I was happy to see practically the entire cast was POC. Even though Martin Freeman was one of the main characters, he never was the ""hero"". T'Challa and other stay in the foreground, while Freeman was more of the side character. Overall, I thought it was great, and have seen it three times. I was not exposed to much hype before I saw it, so that probably made it better to me since I had no idea what to expect."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,7/10,"I think the movie really was over-hyped, but I did like it. Yes the story line has been used in other movies, but they did it pretty well. What I don't get is the Vibranium angle. It's the same stuff that Captain America's shield is made out of. It's supposed to be the toughest metal on earth, but somehow in this movie, it powers things and can be very unstable. It made me think that they were mixing it up with the Tesseract, which was an energy source. In Blank Panther, somehow the metal itself somehow gave them technology. Other than this movie, it's only know previous property has been it's toughness and it's ability to rebound energy (part of it's toughness) , not somehow store it for use at a later time. When Thor's Hammer hit the Cap's shield in t he original Avengers, it bounced all that energy back to Thor, it didn't supercharge his shield for use at a later time of his choosing. Maybe that's the technology that ""came with"" Vibranium. Don't know. Still trying to figure that one out. They kept bringing it up again and again and again. Otherwise a pretty good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"There seems to be a movement on to bring these IMDb ratings down. we've seen that before, haven't we? with Black Panther making 500 million worldwide in just 7 days, someone must love it. why isn't that reflected here?this movie is a revelation. it's not really a superhero film. it's more the tale of a fantastically wealthy African tribe on the verge of a turning point in their history. it is beautifully told, with gorgeous actors, sets, costumes and metaphors for so many things going on presently in the world. it delves into morality, family, and our responsibilities to each other and the world.it does all this with action and a heart rarely seen in comic book movies. we feel the gravity of King T'Challa and Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman. we sympathize with the true villain, Killmonger by Michael B Jordan. we are spellbound by the beauty of Lupita Nyong'o and the fierceness of Danai Gurira and her regiment of the deadly Dora Milaje.this movie offers vistas and actions and philosophies we've never seen before in any movie, much less a black one. it's a juggernaut that's never been seen before in black filmmaking, and it's worth every moment of our time and thoughts. the only other thing i could compare this too is the reaction by the world to Michael Jackson's Thriller when it first came out. it changed music, and this may well change what we see at the theater forever."
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2019,6/10,"I walked into this film really wanting to LOVE it, but just wasn't feeling it as I thought I would.I'm a big fan of Chadwick and love his work. The actors are great - except Jordan as the villain, who I couldn't stand. He reminded me of a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum the whole movie. Whitaker is criminally underused.The movie looks amazing, no question, but I felt like there was something huge missing. Sorry if any of this wasn't helpful to you."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2020,7/10,"This is a very overrated film. Though it is overrated it is also an okay movie. The story is alright, but is not the best marvel movie of the past decade. I have no clue in how this movie was even a best picture nominee. Infinity war could have been a nominee over Black Panther. It is a good movie, so please don't take it as a bashing."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2020,1/10,"OMG!! Let's start there. I was really hoping it was going to get better farther into the movie but nope . Had troubles staying awake a lot of it...Much of the movie was so pointless . The Michael B. Jordan character is just a complete rip off of other movie characters and so over acted..Story line was drawn out and just dumb, as i said i like good sound effects for my home theater and it was missing that even!! No idea who is rating crap like this 7-9 stars"
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2020,3/10,"I hate even thinking the thoughts I do about this film because it is so, so great to have black representation in this genre, late alone far reaching Hollywood style films. On that level it is a 10/10. The trouble is, the film is terrible. Good news, I think most of these Marvel films are terrible. Their over-reliance on CGI has made them silly and instantly dated. If the goal was to make a film relegated to the pile of forgotten and unwatchable movies in under a decade, it was a success. What makes this one worse than most Marvel films; however, is the terrible writing. I am going to focus there because the acting was actually really great from all involved with even a few standouts from Jordan and Wright. One example ought to do. How can you tell me this ""kingdom"" is the safeguard of easily the most advanced technologies on earth and yet they decide their kingdom's ruler by hero death match?!?!?! Does it get any more barbaric. This could be possibly overlooked were it not for being the central device driving the entire movie's plot forward. This is inexcusable and just lazy writing."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,10/10,"I've seen a few superhero movies and in context this one is unique in that the panther is constrained in some respects by also having to be a ruler/politician of a country. the movie makes the viewer privy to some of the inner conflicts of this unique challenge. however, the idea behind the suit is very engaging, and the society something to consider and entertain: what if there existed a land never colonized, how would they fare? with technological advancement meeting tradition would a physical battle for the country's leadership be replaced by... voting? computerized selection? their tradition respects bloodlines and prowess. somehow i think the prodigious racial aspect of the movie has some people uncomfortable with that idea and imagery, likely causing them to squirm in their seats with their brains bursting trying to find every possible angle why this fictional superhero in a fictional country in a fictional universe is so utterly unrealistic!so now a few weeks after release and the movie's overall reception has exceeded projections and expectations. now i've noticed what seems a concerted effort to slow or halt the appreciation and success of this artistic work of fiction: keep it out of the media, produce highly critical muted reviews, and refrain from mentioning it in public discourse (if at all possible). perhaps it will die a quieter death.i believe it is, nonetheless, an amazing story! the part that reflects on america's unfairness to some of its less fortunate citizens certainly will offend many who are among the privileged, but again, this is a work of fiction, just like so many of the glimpses the public is given of africa - this continent with 50 some countries speaking over a thousand languages reduced to what amounts to a small backwater in the public's eye..."
BLACK PANTHER,10 January 2021,7/10,"The movie is good but it became overrated after chadwick boseman's death
But the worse thing is the similar writings
Between it and thor 1
The one of family that wants to win the throne of kingdom and then he win and the hero becomes strong and wins the throne again"
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2021,2/10,"I just watched it and I hope I didn't.
I lost some irreplaceable 2 hoursI could spend on something more productive- like knitting.
The film is full of inconsistencies and plot holes I already saw in other films and enjoyed them more. Save your time, watch something else."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2021,6/10,"For an action movie based on a comic, it was alright. Was it the earth shattering, defining moment that some were claiming? No.Over rated, definitely, but most Marvel movies are.Thor and Guardians of the galaxy are miles ahead of this mediocre movie. But that seems to be Marvels problem. Trying to recreate their early successes is difficult. But the later attempts have been sadly missing in a real story, and even the production quality has decreased.Too often these days, the end product doesn't fulfill the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,2/10,"Just too many plot holes, and, as usual, too much reliance on special effects. But (spoiler alert) the worst part was the fact that the plot revolved around, and reinforced, the whole ""the black man has been oppressed by the white man and now is our time for revenge"" theme. Of course, the good black men triumphed over the bad black men in the end, but did not refute the above mentioned theme, although they changed it slightly to ""since we have been better than the white man all along, we will now help them come up to our level."" I get it, it's a story. But all the black political undertones just spoiled it completely for me. On the plus side, the fighter pilot saved the day in the end (as usual)!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,1/10,What a mess - you can't watch this to the end. I gave up about half way through but it was cringe inducing from the very beginning. I hate to say this but what is the reason behind this monstrosity - white guilt? I can't figure out the annoying accents - were they all foreign exchange student graduates of a British prep school? What is that Millennial Falcon transport thing? No explanation for any of the advanced technology combined with spears and face paint and tribal dancing. Beyond belief. It was fun figuring out where I've seen certain actors before. The whole movie was packed with familiar faces that added to the confusion of who is who and what subplot are we exploring now. I must say Michonne from The Walking Dead certainly has upped her swordsmanship - I hope she further displays that in the next season of TWD. Skip it - don't even Redbox it or you'll regret it too.
BLACK PANTHER,29 December 2019,3/10,"This movie was average at best. It has a 97% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes, which is laughable and it's all because those ""professional"" reviewers can't look past their own liberal ignorance and vote for a movie on its merit. They liked this movie ONLY because it has a bunch of black people playing the good guys. The movie itself is average for a Marvel flick. The villain is nothing more than a pissed off version of Black Panther with a bad upbringing and a street ghetto attitude. It's worth a watch, but there are many better Marvel movies available."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"I have been waiting for a Black Panther movie for years and this film did not disappoint me. This movie is perfect. In fact, I think it's the best Marvel film to date. Everything about the movie is perfect. The cast is amazing, the make-up was brilliant, the costumes were gorgeous, the music was outstanding and the action scenes were so well done. Marvel has raised the bar. Let's hope they can keep this up. Black Panther is a film for the ages."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,1/10,"The first time a saw the trailer for this movie last year a had a feeling that it will be boring. Nothing about it was exciting, but I said I have to give it a chance.I probably need to listen to my gut more often because this movie was a waste of time and money. I do not get why all the critics praise this movie. It just didn't click with me, like I was looking at something not important, with no real story, more like a reenacted documentary from a science and history channel.The CGI was outdated (those rhinos were the worse - if you saw the movie, you understand). The city looked so fake, even Asgard from the first Thor looked more real. The action was boring and it just did not make sense some time.Besides the good cast this movie is just boring and not relevant enough like the other MCU movies. I really do not get the hype and the critical acclaim. It feel fabricated and not organic.There was too much talking about nothing, about what is good and was is not for Wakanda to go public with that unrealistic technology jump they have from vibranium. If you have an advanced civilization build in that bubble, why do you still need to choose your next king totally undemocratic, but the old fashion way - just fight for the tittle. If you leave this plot hole out you really have no movie, because the villain will just not form. I mean they try to bring in a villain half way into the movie, and you don't know him, you do not care enough for his motives, just boring.I get what Marvel wanted to do with this movie (as I said - fabricated for the really annoying Hollywood so this and so that movements from the past years) - but just that make no good movie. This was suppose to happen shortly after the events at the UN meeting in Captain America: Civil War. I mean the king just died and everybody is just fine: no funeral, no tears, no heart-brake, just a short mention in the beginning before that fight for the title. I never felt so un-invested in a MCU movie before.Also that Wakanda Forever feels like the X-factor sign and it scares me because it feels like brainwashing of the people."
BLACK PANTHER,2 December 2018,9/10,"Really enjoyed this, it was very entertaining.
It's definitely not your typical Marvel movie. I usually spend some time playing games on my phone during superhero movies, but not this one. I liked that it was different, no stupid jokes, endless fights and similar. Think it's rather harsh to give it a 1, definitely not the worst movie of my life.
It's a movie about a different culture, with a different belief system, so of course it didn't meet everyone's expectations. I love that the fight between the good and the bad isn't that polarizing, and that it's not about who has more wealth and power. I love that it has strong female characters (that's what I expected to get from Wonder Woman, not the crap that we were served). I really hope that it will inspire some girls to follow their dreams, to be fearless, to be engineers... I love the visuals, the references to African culture. Love the soundtrack.
Try to watch it without any expectations, and you'll enjoy it."
BLACK PANTHER,2 December 2018,9/10,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this movie. Great storyline, lots of action and kept me engaged. Since seeing at the theatre we have rewatched it multiple times.
Highly recommended!"
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2021,2/10,"I got 22 minutes and 9 seconds into this movie before I gave up. It's just. SO. BORING. Overhyped, overrated, and I will NEVER get that 22mins and 9 seconds of my life back. Only reason I gave it a 2 is because the costumes are decently cool."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2020,4/10,"I get it, I do. I get the reason this film was hyped up. Beyond all the reasons why, though. This was a poor superhero movie all round.I haven't got much to say on it other than it was massively overhyped by critics and was a big disappointment."
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2020,2/10,"This movie was just pathetic.
Same level as Justice League."
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2018,8/10,Personally I loved the movie and really adored Shuri!
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,9/10,"A tremendous film, that helped change the world. CB is and will always be an inspiration to millions, regardless of race, color, creed, gender....Rest In paradise Sir. And thank you Forever."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2018,2/10,"Could have been better
Tooooooo much CGI, What happened to using real props?
Why is the movie sooooo expensive if everything was done with a computer?"
BLACK PANTHER,5 January 2020,1/10,"What is this??? Stupid plot, unbelievable acting and a giant bore."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,2/10,"It's good to see that I'm not the only person who thought this movie lacked EVERYTHING that people expect from a Marvel movie - light on action, heavy on agenda and soooo preachy! It's time for the entertainment industry to realise they are here to amuse us, not throw their political leanings at us - this character had so much to prove and failed miserably. I want my money back!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I went into this movie with high expectations and was not at all disappointed! I loved it because it was so much more than a start to finish action packed thriller filled with explosions. It was a film, with a story that moved gracefully from scene to scene. Not to mention, the setting was breathtaking. Sure there was some slight CGI hiccups here and there and the villain could have acted some parts better, but the movie was so enjoyable that those things didn't matter to me at all. I was blown away by it and now consider Black Panther my favorite Marvel film!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,"This film has amazed me in so many ways that I had to go and watch it twice. I am planning to watch it again and again because it is just that powerful. It carries a bold and important message not just to African Americans, but I believe for the world. Some have their negative opinions of this film, but I believe it is the very thing I needed to see to appreciate my black heritage on a whole new level. I truly thank the entire cast. They did a phenomenal job! I can go on and on...just go see it already!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"Holy. Crap.I went in not expecting much, but this is quite possibly the best Marvel movie that has been made yet. The story line is INCREDIBLE. I can't believe people are complaining about pacing. I honestly feel like there are reviewers out there that refuse to allow movies to just be that good, or have 100% reviews so they HAVE to drag it through the mud. What a damn shame.The action is absolutely incredible. Well done fight scenes. Lots of times you hold your breath and feel stressed about what is happening.Chadwick. Is. Incredible......but can we talk about those women!? WOW. WOW! There is so much female kick-ass moments in this movie it's absurd. Good humor, tears at the heart, fantastic action, good pacing - it's a perfect movie.Sad that some people feel the need to shame it just to break the cycle."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"I kept an open mind but end up feeling disappointed. The story line was bland, the acting was mediocre and there was too much cgi that the entire movie felt like a child's fantasy land. This was over hyped and over rated."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"If you expect the same excitement, humour and action as in Thor, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy or the Captain America movies you will be disappointed; however, if you are ready to give it a chance and see something different, you'll love it. I don't agree with those who said there was no great acting, the actors were brilliant, especially the women. Yes, it's true that politics was involved but I think in a good way, it conveyed a message which people in today's modern societies need. The visuals, the costumes were beautiful and the soundtrack too. The story was well written and there were surprising/unexpected elements as well. Only the beginning was a bit boring. I enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again just like any other Marvel movies. The 9/10 is because Loki was not in it.:( (Not that I expected him to be, but he's my absolute favourite villain:))))"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"Ohhhhhh my! I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the reviews touted but geeeeees, it was worst than my worst expectations. I just wished I had been home watching it on BluRay so I could have fast forwarded over the numerous chases, fights scenes and predictable dialogue. I was aching to get up and run out of the theater because I have better things to do. So much for African heritage - doesn't come close to giving it a relevant platform to show it off. Nothing unique or vastly different about this flick so don't buy into the hype that it is. Probably the worst of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,1/10,"I went to see this based on ratings and a friend's birthday request. Quick summary - numerous fight scenes, chases, terrible screenplay. Nothing unique about this movie. I was looking for a quick exit soon after the movie started and wishing I was home watching this on blue ray or DVD so I could fast forward through this mess and save a couple of hours of my life. I keep hearing ""Tribute to Africa"" in the media, viewers and critics alike. The movie backdrop was set in a fictional Africa. It was actually filmed mostly in Korea. So much for the tribute. There is no real life homage to the country, its culture and way of living now or in the past. As far as the superhero part, there is nothing the black panther does that is in any way unique. Superman can leap tall buildings, has superhuman strength, has xray vision, Spiderman has spidy senses and his webs to get around town with, Ironman...well Ironman is Ironman. Black panther just seems to able to jump short distances horizontally (not so much vertically) with a bullet proof suit on. Oh, he does have the gooey purple stuff that he drinks that is supposed to make him the BP but I really couldn't tell the difference with or without it. Ughhhh.This was the worst I am not sure he really is a superhero of all the I am not sure he is a superhero movies I've ever seen. PS. If you are new to theater 3D (vs documentaries filmed in real life) as I was - don't bother with the 3D version unless you at all have a choice. All the superimposed graphics of aircraft, backdrops, crowds of people, etc make it look terribly fake and the perspectives are all off. It makes you think they borrowed a few sets from the old Ultraman TV series, yeah, superhero Ultraman, that's right!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2020,8/10,"I have only seen few Marvel movies. I looked forward to this after listening to soundtrack songs for years now. Interesting concept with different tribes snd one with best technology being in lead. It was fascinating thought that there could be civilization with better technology than now and how they would use it. I would have love to see effects of Wakanda outside of that country but movie stayed quite safely to its roots and politically correct. Seems to be trend these days, maybe its disney decision. Also thought that someone wants to destroy 1000 year old culture just to change things up for sake of it. Also with race rights being discussed now I think its interesting to think what resentment slaved people have for their ""masters"" and will they seek revenge or forgiveness."
BLACK PANTHER,9 February 2021,6/10,"One of my least favorite Marvel films, and the only one it feels like a chore to re watch. The characters are flat and the movie is similarly lacking in personality. Absolutely no suspense--how can there be when the character is not only bulletproof, getting shot actually makes him more powerful? That said Wakanda itself is the biggest Mary Sue in the film. Perfect utopian societies don't make for engaging drama."
BLACK PANTHER,16 August 2018,2/10,"This was the first Marvel movie I had watched in over 4 years, and man did I hate it. I've always hated marvel movies, because of how predictable and boring the stories are. I mean, sure, they're well made movies, but holy crap. Why do people find these entertaining? All marvel movies play out the exact same. Introduce the protagonist, then the antagonist, insignificant stuff happens, a character ""dies"" then comes back, the 2 fight at the end, then all is well. Repeat 20 times with a different skin. This movie was no exception. I don't care that the almost the entire movie is black, I actually think that's awesome. I wish we had more movies that did this. My issue is this movie follows the formula to a T. It was just so boring. I will say, I did like a couple of things they did. I liked the costume and set design. They were amazing. Music was also nice. It was something different. The villains in this movie were also a little better than your standard marvel, but still not anywhere near the level of other villains in different movies. I've heard some people say the villain was very relatable, but he just seemed a bit too forced to me. Not to mention the political messages were so in your face it was ridiculous. 
*Spoiler* When Michael B Jordan's character said something like ""there are thousands of black people everywhere that need help"" or whatever, it was just so on the nose that it was ridiculous. What they could have done instead is maybe show more of what is wrong with black society, maybe show a bit more of the villain as he grew up. Let us see something like that. That way we can empathize with him. See what he struggled with. Because otherwise, he's just a villain. And that's all there is to it. *Spoiler End*Overall, just another cliche marvel movie with a different skin. Although this one is maybe just a tad better than the others, it still has the same weaknesses. If you like marvel, you'll like this. If you're like me, you'll hate it. If I had to recommend it to somebody, I'd say don't watch it. It was awful."
BLACK PANTHER,14 October 2018,1/10,"No direction, no story and overrated beyond belief"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"The ratings prove ""we"" love this movie. The critics agree. It's a tense, intense action thriller epic story. It was really cool, to have just two ""token"" white guys, a bad one, and a good one. I guess most of you have not noticed that it's normally swapped color schemes. I grew up with Marvel comics, they taught me to read. I had dyslexia, and the graphic novel was by far the best teaching for me... DC was boring. Maybe norms don't notice the color pallet in most movies either. I'm an old white guy. I noticed. I hate oppression, so it's a joy to see a movie whites don't dominate, whites don't replace other nationalities for our ""comfort"". I read the original black panther comic books. and they were a big deal at the time. All the good people in this movies defend human life without regard to race... not so the bad folks. Many of you roman empire folks want to see a roman win. I see a lot of folks who did not enjoy the comic books as kids, don't understand the ethic of superhero movies. Darker movies seem more popular with the mainstream. You missed out. Superheroes do the right thing no matter the legacy hatreds, no matter the personal pain. They do it wearing tights too. They fear nothing."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther, much like Civil War, is not only a fun superhero movie with fantastic action scenes, it's a movie with a message! I won't spoil it, but it has one! Black Panther was a blast from start to finish! The acting was great, especially from Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan! The film has the best villain in an MCU movie since Loki, he has one of the best backstories I've seen in a long time! The story is simple, but it works! Seriously, people always expect a deep and complex story, it's always hard to satisfy people. The action scenes, while can be a bit dark sometimes, are still fantastic and tons of fun to watch! If you're looking for a fun action/superhero movie, Black Panther is definitely for you! It's a must see for Marvel fans! Seriously people, not everything has to be The Dark Knight!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,7/10,"If you are looking for an Avengers feel, wait for the Avengers: Infinity War.I thought BP was a good stand alone film. Where it could have used a little time to build on a couple of characters' backstory, it was overall a good movie. I'm not giving anything away: I do think the hype for this movie is a little overrated; I thoroughly enjoyed it in whole. I would title this movie the ""Tokyo Drift"" of Marvel (I really liked ""Tokyo Drift""). There are no super Marvel characters popping out of the blue; but does every movie really need that? Do we need to be reminded EVERY TIME that this is a Marvel movie? At this point in time (of the Avengers series), is T'Challa even an Avenger yet?Don't go in expecting a normal Avengers feel. Go in to this movie with an open mind of a good stand alone (much better than Dr Strange)"
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2018,5/10,"This was realy not the movie that I expected. Best Marvel Ever??? No way!
Poor story, bad CGI, a good child movie. Not more. Hope that infinty war Will be much better."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is written like a Shakespearean saga. The vivid articulate characters and story evoke the classics in a revolutionary new way. Not only is the character development celestial, but the authenticity in costume design, linguistics and artistry are just as intricate as Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The depiction of Africa is a beautiful reminder of the great civilizations of the continent. Black Panther is a must see for people from all walks of life. This film deserves to win multiple Academy Awards and sequels."
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,1/10,I fell asleep during the first 30 minutes and fast forwarded through the next 30 stopping only when something looked action packed. I kept hoping it would improve but it never did. Glad I didn't see it at the theater. I would have walked out.
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,6/10,"In theory everything should have been very nice, but something's off and you don't know exactly what.Visuals are nice but sometimes feels like a video game.
Too much CGI on battles...Characters are kinda good but not great.
Blend story.
No fear of what's gonna happen for the main hero.
You end up rooting for the anti-hero.It's nice to have the real Andy Serkis in this movie but his character is underused...I will sell my blu-ray, It's not a keeper.Not mad about this, just ""meh"""
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2019,4/10,Of the same type of Thor and Aquaman. Brothers fighting for throne. I am tired of these kinds of stuff.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,1/10,Probably the worst Marvel's movie.It's very overhyped. Don't bother with this one.Hopefully they will discontinue this waste otherwise I'm done with the Marvel Universe..
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"Not quite sure what to expect with this movie. I just did not want to see a politicized movie about the current state of affairs in this country. And it definitely is not that at all! I'm tired of Hollywood, the writers, directors, and the actors with their opinions on anything at all!
This movie had nothing to do with any of that. It was well written, plenty of action, and you really liked all the characters in the movie, even the bad guys for a change. Thank You!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2019,4/10,"This was an average marvel movie.
Good storytelling, very good visuals, acting showed some bright spots.
Too much of a political overtone for this type of movie.I attend movies like this for pure entertainment, no subtle references, or in some cases not so subtle, to white colonization.Again, entertaining, good storytelling, good visuals, good performances.Not oscar worthy."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,2/10,"I wanted to like this, I've really liked many Marvel movies. I found the main hero to be boring and really nothing special. The villain was very cool, interesting, and strong. Acting was fine, special effects were fine, but I just didn't care about the characters. Then of course they seemed to have thrown subtle political jabs in there."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,10/10,A well directed movie with a fantastic cast. I really enjoyed the story line and play. A must see movies that surely keeps inspiring young people if any color! Watched it twice and surely will watch it again... waiting for the sequel
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2018,3/10,"Very boring and very hard to understand their broke English (the actors were Americans) . First the story doesn't make any sense to me, is not a superhero movie, but a movie about a fantasy land with real name. Rich people with superpower and great resources that do not help their own.
The critics that acclaim this movie must have real political interest. 
I spent money to see it in 3 D and I was very unhappy."
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,5/10,"If this were any other film, I would say, eh, nothing special, just another Marvel Studios crank-job. But this was not billed as just another Marvel movie, this was pushed out as the next big thing, the future of films. Every single critic was fawning over it like thier kid at the school play. However, when its metecritc score dropped below 100, everyone lost their minds. I actually found a post citing that white crtics gave it a bad review because of racism. Meanwhile the film has subpar acting from nearly half of the cast, the CGI in the first Iron Man (2008) was better, and there were so many plot-holes, I gave up an hour in. The rest of my family was done after the 30 minute mark. In addition to its technical faults, the film had no message, was rife with identity politics, and was generally bland. When I say identity politics, let me break it down. Nearly all warriors with the exception of the Black Panther are female, it portrays a charicature of African culture despite it being a hyper advanced society, American culture and ideals are made fun of at every opportunity and oh yeah, they had segregated screenings of it. Literally found a theater in town doing an early screening. When I showed up, the ticket office manager said the following. ""I'm sorry sir, I can't let you in, we are only accepting people of color today.""This review will probably get removed for hate speech or some such other excuse, but it does not change the fact that it was a boring film that was heralded as the second coming."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2018,4/10,"Nothing Original Here! At tones I wasn't sure if I was watching a Star Wars film, one of Tarantino's Kill Bills, a Lord of the Rings film or a scene from Casino Royale. I suspect I was watching them all. 
Which doesn't mean I hated it. It just lacked originality"
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2019,5/10,"I'm a big fan of the Marvel movies but this movie was a big disappointment, some of the cast are great and some are just plain awful lol, the story was a boring, think it gets rave reviews for all the wrong reasons, it could of been so much more."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,10/10,"I have rarely came out of a movie theater feeling the full range of emotions. Black Panther did that. As much as this was just another superhero movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, It was a whole lot more then that. It was a emotional roller coaster that will inspire, sadden, laugh, and cheer. This is marvel at its best. Chadwick Boseman brought this character to life in the most amazing way possible. The actors and actresses around them made this movie incredible. From Danai Gurira playing the tough as nails General Okoye, Luptia Nyong'o as the lovely but no nonsense Nakia, Michael B. Jordan redeemed himself in the super hero movie world as the villainous Killimonger, is Andy Serkis as the power crazy Claw, Martin Freeman as the brave Everrt Ross, and the always talented Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett. Oh, Black Panther co-creator Stan Lee as always makes a appearance. Director Ryan Cooger, you redefined the superhero movie, hell, all movies with this. Congratulations on this masterpiece."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"I'm a big fan of Marvels' movies. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same of DC Justice League. Well, the visual effects are really impressive. I'm anxious to see the next performance of Black Panther in Avenger Infinity war."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2020,2/10,"Just watched it on TV.
It was boring.
Not even close to other Marvel superhero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2018,1/10,"Over narrated, Bad special effects. Bad played. The Worst Marvel Movie so far."
BLACK PANTHER,16 August 2021,10/10,"I just scrolled though a slew of 1 and 2 star reviews on this site and I am wondering if the people who left those negative reviews were watching the same movie I have watched many times and thoroughly enjoyed again tonight. Black Panther is one of the best films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What were they seeing that I did not? I see excellent plot-line, action and special effects, and a message of hope for Wakandans working towards world peace and mutual cooperation with many nations towards world peace. It seemed they were ready to join the 21st century by sharing their technology to make the word a better place.This is the least boring I have seen in years, Chakwick Boseman who was fighting cancer during the filming put in an excellent performance as T'Challla, and I will miss him in the next Black Panther film. Lupita Nyongo was excellent as Nakia, and I loved Letitia Wright as little sister Shuri, with all those fascinating gadgets and gizmos.I admit there were some slow scenes in Korea with Klaue, the villain and setting up with Killmonger for later scenes. That's the only negative thing I can think of without giving spoilers.I love this movie. Don't pay any attention to the naysayers."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"For a character, whom, even just a couple of years ago, people had known nothing about, Black Panther created quite an appreciable amount of hype and expectation and lived up to it all. Marvel's latest release packs a lot of exhilarating action with imaginative and vibrant visuals and a detailed plot. It is the story of an African prince from the fictitious nation of Wakanda, thrown in the face of kingship after the sudden death of his father, having to deal with his new found responsibilities, rivals and an unexpected enemy with a connection to his own past. This movie may not be exactly an origin story as it is not the first time we see this character but it checks all the boxes for qualifying as one and from the string of all of the recent ones we've seen, this may as well be the best. Breaking away from formulaic Marvel (which I love too) Black Panther immerses itself in the climate of a foreign land and stays true to the heart and culture of Africa. Every part of the film is very well thought out in terms of visual detail and since the story is of the mythological kind, there is almost a fairytale-like charm we feel, when watching the film walk down very similar lanes. Black Panther's character also gives us throwback vibes of James Bond as he is mostly decked with high tech gadgets and suits with even a car that need not be directly driven by him (Tomorrow Never Dies, anyone?). Applaudable character development has become second nature to a Marvel production and we see that tradition being continued very diligently here too. Chadwick Boseman obviously dazzles in the titular role and manages to balance the intricacies of his character's delicate nature and strong determination and power skillfully. But everyone around him is equally valuable to the story too and it never feels like the film was being borne on the shoulders of the lead only. In fact, without the rest of his team which includes a lot of fiery women, he would probably have died. There aren't many jaw dropping twists in this film although a significant one occurs at the interval where the story changes course. The movie deals with some very relatable and often contentious political issues too, that the lead deals with as a result of him becoming the king of his country but with the truth of his very own existence being shrouded in secrecy, it gets a lot harder for him to do the right thing. Thus, watching him mature into the leader that his people need is an enjoyable experience. The villain is challenging and tests the limits of the hero's abilities which is what shows us how human the latter really is and how sometimes, that and loyalty is enough to overcome any obstacle.On the whole Black Panther is a layered film with diverse aspects just like the soul and culture of the place it is set in. It will leave you with the excitement of Infinity War, too, as the mid-credits and post-credits scenes set up, to some extent, the prologue of the upcoming climactic extravaganza."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,"This film is horrible, there are low budget films that are good, there are low budget films that are bad, there are high budget films that are good, and there are films like this, high budget films that are bad. This film is a flop, the only reason people give 10/10 is because they want to be politically correct, that's why, the truth is sad."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,10/10,I saw this when it first came out in February and I loved it. As I look at other reviews I see 1 stars and 2 stars. I am wondering why so much hate? I am glad marvel is becoming diverse with there movies.
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,1/10,"Lines like: another white boy we can fix, seem a bit racist. Other than being very proud of their skin color, white people are obvious barbaric and less harmful human in their eyes. The graphics are very good, storyline is also interesting but a great deal of scenes seem overcompensating. The choice of actors could have been better, the movie comes across as if they had something to prove when making the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2018,10/10,Best marvel of 2018. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is definitely not the biggest hero in the Marvel Universe. Well, in the comics he isn't. He also isn't the most popular, or the oldest, or the most powerful. But, he comes close to all of those and one thing he can claim is that he probably has the best movie adaptation out of all of the other super heroes in the Marvel Universe. The first thing I should mention about this amazing movie though is it's message! The movie introduces very complex themes and ideas, such as ""why would a country that could save the world hide from it"" and ""how can a man kill his own brother yet still lead a nation with expertise."" There's also almost constant social commentary and complex debates on various issues. So it is nice to see a movie that both makes us think and makes us ooh and ahh for once, especially one coming from Disney. The story is also great. It is also full of complex ideas and full of twists, though it also comes with a couple of kinks, but it is still pretty good. The acting is also great, Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan especially shining as the protagonist T'Challa/Black Panther and the antagonist Erik Killmonger. They are both amazing! The supporting cast is also great as well. Lupita Nyongo'o brings a nice hard ass vibe to her character of Nakia, the world desperately needs more characters like her and Dania Gurira is as equally hard ass as Nyong'o in the role of Okoye: The leader of Wakanda's all-female fighting force. The breakout Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya plays W'Kabi, the Wakandian government official who teeters between good and evil Letitia Wright plays Shuri, the witty and whip-smart younger sister/assistant to T'Challa. Wright is the movie's comic relief, and she is amazing at it! Some of the best lines from the movie are said by her. Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Basset also star as the villainous cyborg terrorist Klaue, the mysterious Wakandian prophet Zuri, and the positive, mentoring, mother of T'Challa. The only bad thing is Martin Freeman's character Everett K. Ross: The very confused stalwart American CIA agent who accidentally figures out the secrets of Wakanda. His character seems a little-taped on. But on the plus side, Wakanda is beautiful. Through a combination of set pieces and CGI, the film makers were able to create a vividly beautiful country that looks very real and will probably be the standard for futuristic cities in the future for movies. Ryan Coogler is an amazing director, his vision permeates pretty much the entire movie. The entire movie is also packed with breathtaking Matrix-style action sequences that are fueled by adrenaline and CGI. The best is probably the South Korean car chase sequence or the fight between Black Panther and T'Challa. The final battle sequence is also not-to-be-missed as well. And, as always, the special effects are also great. And, on an ending note, the soundtrack (which includes All the Stars by SZA and Kendrick Lamar, Pray for Me by The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar, and King's Dead by Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Future, and James Blake) is downright amazing! It mixes African drumming with rap with orchestra. Now that is a feat. There is also a brilliant mid-movie twist but I won't spoil it for you. But, with all that being said, Black Panther truly sets a new standard for Marvel and will reign for the rest of time as a masterpiece."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,6/10,"I thought this film was decent, it flowed from start to finish without you really loosing concentration, that being said I did get bored though, it was a good film with plenty to like but the story was very forgetable, killmonger played by Michael B Jordan was very good I felt he carried the plot but then when the main event happens I willl say as to not spoil, it turns very idiotic to say the least what they have him do was just ludicrous."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2021,1/10,Don't believe da hype. This is a TERRIBLE film and has a ludicrous storyline to match. Absolute TRASH.
BLACK PANTHER,9 July 2018,5/10,Good for ages 10 and under. For adults movie is ok mediocre. All the action scenes on movie are sorta boring. Story is good.
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,1/10,"Overhyped, very poorly scripted. Poor animation & story."
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2020,8/10,"I liked the movie and its graphics, it was really enjoyable."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,4/10,"A bit sluggish, borderline boring. my youngest fell asleep. no memorable action sequence. the first half of the action is not well lit and the editing is not that brilliant which makes it difficult to see whats going on. weak final battle scene, kind of a copying a certain famous final battle scene with the ""waiting until a technology passes"" kind of a thing. the only interesting thing is actually his speech at the end of the movie. the final battle is also seems quite video game CGI-ish (esp the part where both of them fell down and still fighting), not to mention how the suit dissolve. i was expecting to be mind blown due to the super rave review. i guess its just over rated."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,Seems quite like lion king and nothing seems in place
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"I think this movie has a lot of mixed user ratings because we all hyped this movie up way too much. I think the excitement of a mostly-black movie got the best of us. We all wanted this movie to succeed. Luckily, before watching the movie, I saw some terrible reviews. Thus, I went into the movie with lowered expectations. THIS HELPED A LOT! Go into the movie with lowered expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised.I enjoyed the change of scenery with the marvel universe. It was awesome to see a highly successful African country. I liked that no other avengers were involved in this movie as well. There was so much to explain with T'Challa. The movie was very visually appealing. Some of the CGI got out of hand, but that's to be expected in any Disney film. Contrary to most of these reviews, I liked the character development (at least with Killmonger and T'Challa). Killmonger had very valid reasons for his motivation to be the ""bad guy."" T'Challa was torn between following his ancestors and expanding to help others. Both characters could be sympathized with.What makes this an 8.5 for me is that it felt a little long. It probably could've been shortened by about 10 minutes. Along with that, the climax of the movie felt a little bland. The ending was meant to be a little heart-wrenching because T'Challa killed his blood relative, but the moment just wasn't fully captured (maybe it was the lack of climactic music?). Other than these things, the movie was enjoyable."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is great, do not question, or take any lower ratings of this movie into consideration. This movie is a must see by all means, great acting , story line , action , and like all Marvel movies it ties into the bigger story in preparation for Infinity War!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,1/10,First half of the film is really boring and second half is a cgi mess. I yawned so many times during the first half that I felt like leaving the theatre. I stayed expecting the second half to be good but dissappointed and was really irritated by the cartoon-ish cgi.The cgi was so bad that it looked like people are fighting rhino's hologram. It was irritating when they show two cartoons are fighting and then scene changes to real people and then back to cartoon. Overall this movie is not at all good.
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,8/10,"I was so excited to see this film that my expectations may have caused me to go into it with too much anticipation. Simply put, it's visually spectacular, but I had trouble connecting with the main characters. The dynamics were well intended, but it felt a little forced. The fight scenes great, the music/soundtrack AMAZING!! It took me about a good hour to get into the plot. Once the stakes are risen (near the end of the film/last act) then I was all in. But it took a vested interest. The music, action sequences, and stunning visuals forgive the parts where the plot falls short. But I can't help but think it may have been intentional direction to sort of restructure the typical Hollywood formula. I'm all for doing things different, but in this case, the plot fell a little flat, until the end (where it revs up 110%). Overall it's a solid film and worth the watch. Just don't give up on it, because it really does get good, and there is a big payoff in the end."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,8/10,A enjoyable Combination of traditional culture and modern technology. The world represented in this movie was extremely creative and the movie ties well together to the MCU. The film includes entertaining characters. Although the film has some undeveloped characters and plots and has a strange pase and some inefficient CGI I highly recommend this film to MCU fans
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"It is a rap song written by kid for kid. Characters are so flat... maybe except Killmonger, at least he got some balls, so predictable and so boring... Beauty king, super noble, silly sister who also is genius, independent future wife, funny hobbit... plot is simple like a broom stick. superkiller is, of course, not killing the biggest opponent, no blood, sweet rhinos... and rap music ?!? French fries with ketchup and maple syrup... don't pay for this movie..."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,6/10,"When the movie Black Panther first came out, it was given really high scores by critics and audiences alike so going in to first watch this movie, I was pretty pumped to watch it but walking out, I realised that it dragged most of the time, the action felt pretty sloppy sometimes and most of the humour felt pretty unfunny but hey, the villain is probably the best I've seen in any MCU movie in a long time.Starting with the most notable of positives, the villain, Kilmonger. At first, he just seems like yet another bland, boring and terrible villain but later on you begin to realise his true motivation which is his belief that Wakanda should be put on the map which he tries to get everyone to believe which is so well done that it saves this movie alone from being considered another average, lacklustre Marvel movie which in itself is a big accomplishment which is kind of incredible. Something minor is Klaw, the supposed main villain until Kilmonger kills him, is probably the funniest part of this movie, whose lines are executed very well by Andy Serkis who I kind of hated in Avengers 2 as the scenes were really mediocre at best but he's actually pretty good which is a relief as Ryan Coogler said 'Hey, we can do justice to this character still, right?' and I'll give it to the guy, he did it pretty well.The performances given by Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan in particular are phenomenal. I really liked Chadwick Boseman in Captain America: Civil War and I can say the same for this movie. However, Michael B. Jordan steals the show. Not only is he written superbly, he is by far the most competent out of everyone else in the movie as he's been in other blockbusters like Creed which I really enjoyed in the end.The major gripe I possess is that the movie mostly drags as most of it is political which is different, sure but it's a superhero movie so I don't really get invested in it at all most of the time.While Klaw's humour worked for me, the rest certainly didn't. I can't believe that the movie actually has the audacity to think that the 'What are those?' joke is still funny as when it was used everyone laughed and I did not. I actually think that it made me angry because it wasn't funny back in 2014 or whenever it first was introduced, and it certainly wasn't funny in the cinema when saw it.The action, which I usually regard as awesome in nearly every MCU movie is actually pretty lacklustre as the Wakandan tech used forces the movie to use makes the scenes really fake looking as the CG is ever so saturated within them. This however, only applies to the scenes where T'Challa is the Black Panther but when he fights Man-Ape and Kilmonger on the kingship battles because it doesn't have to rely on CG to carry potentially good action and make it all bombastically fake looking.Overall, Black Panther is a movie that is a movie that I definitely consider to be one of the most overrated MCU movies in a while that I'm giving a six out of ten. Hopefully, Ryan Coogler gives us a equally interesting villain in the sequel to this because let's face it, it's inevitable that it will and he improves the overly comical and mostly sloppy action by giving us a balance between the story, the characters and the action."
BLACK PANTHER,31 January 2019,5/10,"Was expecting something of Christopher Nolan quality after all the hype and Oscar nomination. Sadly not even close. Especially the directing. Overly long too. Some good acting though, decent story, and much better than most superhero movies. That all said, don't believe the hype!"
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2019,3/10,"The hip-hop gangster feel and use of hip-hop music anytime Killmonger was on screen ruined the overall feel of the film for me. The villain's story was also like every other villain out there except without the feel of genuine threat.Killmonger aside however, it was not a bad origin story. The effects were great and the cast were good just a shame that they had to give the villain such a bland story, make him out to be the next biggest hip-hop star (ruining the flow of an otherwise great score) and have him portrayed as a spoilt playground bully rather than a villain of credible threat."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2019,1/10,Have watched all the marvel movies!Have enjoyed all of them...until this movie!
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2020,7/10,"I don't hate the film. On the contrary, I like the level of telling jokes in Marvel films, but I also hope Marvel film industry can make a more bold breakthrough and try. Finally, they made the unique and mature work ""black leopard"", which made me feel very happy and gratified after five years in the pit. If we can encourage white films to be praised and recognized by everyone, why do we have to reject black films by the four words of ""political correctness""."
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2020,3/10,"Marvel neckbeards inflated the ratings for this one. Michael Jordan is brilliant as usual, but my word is the story ever boring! Another overrated POS from Marvel. And Scorcesse was absolutely right. Marvel is ruining cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,19 August 2018,1/10,An insult to black people. Also an insult to the viewer's intelligence. A breathtakingly offensive movie.
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,2/10,"I remember thinking in the Immortals wow I will never forget these costumes and masks! Never thought that here once, It was ok and loved Michael B but all else failed for me"
BLACK PANTHER,2 January 2019,2/10,"No consistency in this film. Wakanda has great technology and people dress well in some parts but then look half poor and half rich in other poverty-appeared areas. So much technology but primitive weapons. This really made no sense, but that basically sums up most of the movie.
The movie itself is longer than it needed to be, and it was god awful boring. This is probably the worst Marvel movie they have ever made. No humor, poor character development, and the plot is not clear until 70% into the movie.
The cinematography was also inconsistent. At one point I thought I was watching Men in Black, another resembled The Fifth Element, and another resembled King Arthur. Video quality quickly went from one scene looking like a movie you expect to see in 2018 with amazing CGI then the next few scenes look straight out of an 80s film.
The film bounced around areas with no real purpose. One moment in space, then in the jungle, then in Korea, then back home. Why was T'Challa bouncing all over the place? This needs to be better explained. His backstory is also almost nonexistent except for his one battle in the beginning over what exactly between the two tribes? Leadership? Food? What? This needs to be explained more clearly.
The lack of clear explanation of anything is why I can't give this movie anything more than a 3. That is being generous."
BLACK PANTHER,1 January 2019,4/10,"I want to start this review by stating that I am not American, so the racial/cultural impact this movie was not something that I can really relate to and as such I am rating this movie for its own merits rather than what it represents.Is it a bad movie? No. The acting is great, the costumes are gorgeous, the protagonists have depth, and the scenery is at times breathtaking. I don't think it deserves all these one-star reviews.Is it a great movie? ...No. The plot is fairly predictable and formulaic, the use of 'vibranium' to solve every issue that arises feels a little cheap, and the main villain is fairly cliche.Most importantly, for me this movie was missing the one element that Marvel movies have consistently delivered: it just wasn't fun. There's very little of the humour that we're used to seeing, there's no surprising plot twists, and the action scenes are at best so-so and at worst an onslaught of terrible CGI that would look out of date 10 years ago.So all in all: watch it once if you're a Marvel fan or if you are interested in the cultural impact side of things. But if you're a casual movie-goer just looking to relax and enjoy yourself for a fun few hours, try Spider-Man: Homecoming or Thor: Ragnarok instead. This is one MCU movie I won't bother rewatching."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2019,1/10,"This movie was a train wreck. It's really no better than Doctor Strange. Infinity War was the best comic book movie this year, yet laughably, Black Panther gets nominated for Best Picture as a token because it's ""so important"". I'd like to buy some crack from whomever nominated it. The Favourite was the Best Picture this year"
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2020,3/10,"Groaning under the weight of it's own political correctness, this colour by numbers adaptation manages only to be utterly predictable and lacking in charm."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2018,5/10,"Immediately I will say - the film is average. After watching it, you leave the cinema with mixed feelings. Somewhere worked with a bang and at some moments, obvious hackwork.The visual part is amazing with its capabilities. The Marvel filmmakers again and again prove to us that they are professionals in their field. The picture is so colorful and colorful that for a while it allows not paying attention to the plot. But when the magic of CGI releases you a little and you begin to think about what is happening, you come to no comforting conclusions. The plot is trivial. It is simple and straightforward. And to be precise, the film consists of several stories and all of them are simple. They go one by one, where one ends - another begins. It's hard to explain, but when you watch it, the opinion arises that the writers seem to have forgotten to twist the story lines and laid it all out like lasagna, layers.A little more annoying deliberate fairy tale of what is happening. They try to explain it with super advanced technologies, but as for me, Marvel has clearly overdone it with gadgets. Adamantium appears here almost as a ""manna from heaven"". He is strong, and technological, and heals wounds, and shoots with a sound from a spear. In a word, ""Fantasia"". About the main character's costume, in general, I keep quiet, an iron man nervously smokes around the corner. Not only is it bulletproof and can accumulate energy so much more ... and is placed in a matchbox. Nothing less than what happens except magic. But the main claims are not to the plot and not to the fairy-tale.The main claims to the main antagonist. There are two of them. And if the first one is an image of a standard villain, with material motivation and could serve as an unpretentious but suitable anti-hero, then about the second one, it's not so simple. In his address was addressed a whole bunch of positive reviews from critics and ordinary viewers, they say, see what is not a standard antagonist, with his ""not on the level"" formed vision of the world and completely logical argumentation of their actions. He tries to appear before us a multifaceted personality. And he, it seems, can, but .... This does not work. Looking at him, you subconsciously understand that a person who has passed through a bunch of military conflicts can not so reflect, can not act like that. We slip a 14 year old teen in the body of a pumped up guy. He behaves like an offender and a hysterical person, and at the end he becomes, trite, pathetic.I am not film critic but for me critical point for this film 2 out of 10, but generally 5 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,2/10,"One of the most over hyped movies I've seen.
The story was the most basic predictable thing you could imagine... yep you guessed it like every other marvel movie. 
Only thing is there is actually no character development at all with these marvel characters, which is a real shame for those who don't spend all their time reading the comics. This is a movie that not only will bore the heck out of you but will also make you feel you've wasted 2 hours of your life becaus of the dreadful movies Anerure errors.
 Even the villain was more likeable then the ""good guy"" black panther, bad story, bad build up, no character development, average acting and forced humour that wasn't needed.
I'd rather watch Batman trilogy 3 times over then this crap"
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,7/10,"I went to see this a few friends and I thought it was pretty good. However, the hype put into the movie is bit much. It's not a perfect superhero movie, but it's definitely something I wouldn't mind owning in my collection to watch again."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"I can't stand Justice League! Did I watch the same movie as the rest of you? How is this a 7.7 rating though most of the written reviews are poor?I feel like there is some statement of political correctness here blinding the quality of the movie itself. The storyline is totally poor - which in turn made the characters a waste of time. For the black panther, he doesn't really show any real power.Then the whole james bond technology montage with 'use this, its really cool to take down a bad guy'The CGI looked pretty damn poor for a 200 million dollar movie, it dragged so much that the movie could have been cut in half quite easily. Battle sequences - now there is Jason Bourne Messy or just messy you don't know whats going on... This was the latter.This movie is propaganda to make a statement on black superheroes. Its a poor delivery for an entertaining movie. Wesley Snipes Blade is far more entertaining than this junk"
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,9/10,"The King has now rested. Don't know how I will relay this news to my kids. Especially my daughter, she loved Black Panther so much. Great talented cast. On a comic book level, this movie was very worthy. That's what we wanted especially when it comes to Marvel. Chadwick Boseman will always be King T'Challa. Will be hard to replace him. Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2019,1/10,How is this movie Oscar worthy. One of the most boring movies I've ever watched. Don't waste your time. Pc gone mad!
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2018,4/10,Not sure why they bothered. Scorned family member stuff. Nothing new or inventive.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I enjoyed the whole movie. As many of you already know that each characters here are well-known actors and actresses. And each one of them, acted marvelously on their act. I will specially say Letitia Wright was awesome and simply Badass. And it's as usual on MARVEL MOVIES, Best CGI effects...Thumbs up."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,5/10,I've had issues with the last couple of marvel movies that everyone seemed to love. Thor Ragnarok and this one. Black Panther isn't a bad movie at all but it's not as good as any captain America movie for example. Too much hype. Wait for digital.
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,1/10,"Aside from not being a good movie and like most marvel movies or tv shows today this movie is a clear example of how badly politics has infiltrated and influences hollywood and how bias and one sided it is. Now while on one note this was the one good thing about the movie since staying true to the source material is always a good thing on another note it also clearly and obviously points out the double standards within marvel movies too. As Marvel is clearly ok for some reason with sticking to the source material when it involves an all black wakanda but not when it's an all white Asgard for example or other superheros or villians from and with all white races, planets, and universes. Political correctness ia cancer!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 July 2018,1/10,"I could easily stop there because basically, there's not much to be said about this movie. But, out of respect for the Marvel franchise, the comics and people who paid to see it, I think that few comments are in place. So, as I said, the movie is very, very, very bad. Everything about it is bad. First of all, it is not a superhero movie which is a little bit strange considering that it is a superhero franchise. The movie is clearly about racial and social issues and that is totally acceptable in some other context but in this situation, it really stands out from the rest of the films and it feels very isolated from the whole franchise. Secondly, these issues were so poorly investigated and presented that it felt like it was a science project by an elementary school student. The acting is quite weak and it seems like the movie was written and directed by an amateur. Also, it was boring. The trailer was far more exciting than the whole movie. CGI was also bad. The relationships between characters felt quite unnatural and forced. 
Black Panther was a great character in Civil War but in this movie, it kinda lost everything that made him relevant. Considering how much hype this movie had, how it was praised that it's going to change the future of Marvel and serve as a culprit of future installments, I was very, very disappointed by it. Everything in the movie looks weak, not developed enough, and it is by far the lowest point of Marvel production. 
The most devastating effect that this movie had (in my opinion) is that I am sure it has ruined the picture of Marvel for most people, especially for those who were not familiar with Marvel before. The movie was praised more than any other in the MCU which I think is a sign of disrespect for other great movies MCU has delivered."
BLACK PANTHER,28 December 2018,10/10,"I guess I missed the hype other reviewers are talking about. I think I pretty much missed the release of this movie. But I just watched it on Netflix and then came here, and I am SHOCKED by all the negative reviews. I LOOOOOOOOVED this movie so much. The storyline and the characters had so much depth. My heart broke for multiple characters in this story, including the ""villain."" The set, costumes, etc. were beautiful. The acting was terrific. And there were so many cute, witty lines thrown in perfectly, delivered perfectly, that made me laugh out loud. Again, not sure why so many people rated it so low. Even if you didn't love it as much as I did, I can't see giving it these lowball scores."
BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,1/10,"USA Today gave this movie a perfect score.... just think about that. Almost every critic gave this movie a B rating which is insane. I've enjoyed every Maeve movie. I'm a easy audience for anything with superhero's, except of course for this one. It wasn't the message the grid to push that made me dislik it, it's simply a bad movie. First the script. It's the lion king with superhero's. It was boring and slow. I don't need action ever second but the parts in between stages this movie to a complete halt. Second the acting. The two main roles were filled by actors that have no ability to hold your interest. No intensity, no presence, it's like they jus read their lines in the most cliche way possible. The directing and CGI were both off as well. Needless to say the professional critics were either paid off or the just felt the HAD to give this movie good reviews. It stinks, it stinks bad and you should avoid it at all cost."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,4/10,"If you're into comic book movies, this one is just okay.I disappointed because the pre-release reviews were amazing. But sitting through it, I don't see what everyone was amazed about. Because african american actors were in it? There are a lot of great actors, who've performed a lot of great rolls, who have happened to be black. This movie breaks no ground there. Heck, this isn't even the first black superhero in film, so that's not even new. In my opinion hyping a movie because it has a lot of black actors is just as bad as not liking a movie because it has a lot of black actors. I'm just saying. With that said, the actors in this one did a good job, I liked them all, even the villain. The CGI wasn't the best, but then again maybe I'm just getting burned out on movies that rely on CGI, and let's face it Marvel relies a lot on CGI. It just seems like the CGI is not getting better. I thought the same thing about the recent Star Wars movie. Overall, it wasn't the worst Marvel movie I've seen, if you like the genre, and ignore the hype, this one probably won't disappoint you.Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,2 December 2020,10/10,"It was a sheer delight to watch this beautiful Black cast . The scenes were dynamic, this film gave me everything I needed , Ryan Coogler has yet to disappoint me . This is definitely a must see even for non Marvel fans like myself."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Ignore the negative reviews... we all know the agenda of the vast majority of them. This is an awesome movie. I hope they do another at least a few more standalones with the Black Panther (versus a huge Avengers movie, where you can't get into the individual characters much at all). I wanted a lot more about this world and these characters! The fight scenes are awesome, the plot is interesting, the female characters rock, there are a lot of complex real-world issues raised. My only bummer was that they killed a character I really wanted more story from."
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2018,8/10,"I can't help but think some reddit anti-sjw people with too much time in their parents basement all got together and decided to flood IMDb with negative reviews. SOMETHING about this movie bothered them. I CANT IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT BE.Look, all that aside, it's a solid marvel movie. If you enjoy the MCU you will like it, and honestly, you already saw it. If you hate super hero movies, no, you won't like it (duh).If you like some and not others, this one tries harder with a plot, has some witty banter, and yes, some different scenery from a bunch of white dudes in New York. And honestly, it's nice. Refreshingly different while still being a movie about powerful people punching each other. And it has two of the best villains so far because they are kind of right... but take it too far. It's better than I'm evil because I'm adopted (lookin at you Loki).And if you don't hate it, come on here and review it. Mark the review you find accurate as ""helpful"" because it's ridiculous that the neckbeards are winning."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,1/10,"Really bad movie. It's boring. Don't see this if you are tired, you will fall right to sleep. The box office section here on IMDB says this movie's budget was $200 million?? That must have all been for salaries, because it certainly didn't go into movie quality. The script was bad. (""White boy""? Really?) The CGI, as always, is awful. Those armor-clad rhinoceroses look like Loony Tunes creations. It's not an action movie, it's not really a super hero movie, it's hype hype hype. 30 minutes of their country's history would have been enough, not 2 plus hours of it so we are drowning in it. I had no desire to see this, I was dragged to it. I can't take the awful CGI anymore. Special effects from 50 year old films look more realistic than those of today. I guess it's a lost art. Too bad. I've no desire to see anymore Marvel films."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,6/10,"I was really hyped for this movie. The trailers looked amazing. Unfortunately, the action scenes in the trailer are, pretty much, the action scenes in the movie. For more than 2 hours, I sat through a live action Lion King without the humor or the cheery songs. The movie is certainly beautiful to look at - the graphics are stunning - except for the last fight scene that doesn't even look as good as many current video games.The actors are...fine. Their performance run the gamut from okay to good. That's it. Everyone seems to be angry or sad all the time. The humor in the movie comes from the leader of the outcast tribe and, of course, the great Andy Serkis, who seemed to be the only one enjoying his role.Frankly, the critics astound me. This movie was derivative and far too self-conscious. Unbelievable as it may seem, of the few negative reviews from professional critics I have read, the best is from Armond White. Do yourself a favor and read it.Ultimately, the measure of a good movie, for me at least, is how likely I would be to watch it again. Like Iron Man 2 and 3, I probably will never watch this movie again. Ever.In short, bland and derivative."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,9/10,I can't believe the terrible reviews on here. This film has taken superhero films up several levels. It's almost Shakesperian.I won't dissect it scene by scene as there are plenty of people who have done that already. What I will say is that I enjoyed every single second of it. My one criticism is that it's too short...i would have liked another 30 or 40 minutes.
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,2/10,Overhyped actionflick without substance only gained traction because of MSM jerking off their arms in reviews.
BLACK PANTHER,6 September 2018,8/10,"It's unfortunate to see so many bad reviews of this film but I understand why. If you are a black person there are themes that you just can't miss that are close to home and the film really speaks on the relationship between African people and black Americans. So many non black people grip about this movie but it is actually very deep. Unfortunately white America is already acclimated to in depth and complex narratives of people that look like them. And, Unfortunately people of color get the short end of the stick with terrible predictable films. I can't name five truly sophisticated non stereotypical black films so of course you have people over the moon excited about it. It's one of the only films where there is a positive black male lead.This movie is wonderful for children of color. It is one of the first films that reinforce self esteem. ""Show him who you are"" is pivotal. The whole idea is knowing who you are and where you come from. Black Americans have been stripped of an identity, as was Killmonger, thus being the driving point of all his rage. If you are outside of the culture and never cared to learn about black culture all of the themes will go over your head. This film shows the power of a nation that is perceived to be impoverished, which is clever and revealing about people who do not want to share their information for fear that it will destroy them, much like Africa and all its resources. A young woman is the head of technological advancement and uhhh the military is all female! That speaks volumes but you just won't get it if you aren't black, which is fine but there is no need to hate a movie that doesn't cater to your perception of the world as many films do. this film gives real history vibes, Wakanda resembles a place called Lesotho and Eric Killmonger resembles a man named Shaka Zulu. If you aren't cultured you complain about CGI and a story line you don't understand. I saw a complaint about people flying across the room when being hit but they clearly didn't pay attention to the fact that the vibranium collects energy and redistributes it, or that T'Challa has super human strength. Don't view the movie as the best marvel movie out but a decent attempt to demonstrate powerful black culture in the form of a super hero because you know Hollywood wants you to believe it can only be done in a fantasy world."
BLACK PANTHER,17 June 2018,1/10,"I am not going to spoil anything or going into detail because i wasted so much time already with this movie which i only watched because of this ratings on IMDB. Well, it was the last time i am going for a reference on IMDB. My other reviews were made by the same anger i have now again and this is fishy....read the review of ""Michel Couzijn"", it sums it all up nicely. Dont waste you time on this crap movie unless u r a hardcore marvel fan (as i was for the comics) and do not try to get an unbiased view from IMDB"
BLACK PANTHER,7 July 2018,5/10,"Just your average superhero movie. Not bad, not good, just average."
BLACK PANTHER,8 August 2019,9/10,What a showstopper movie I must say that loved every single scene from the movie hands down to the actors and directors and plot
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2021,1/10,"Nigeria? The only things I received from Nigeria was letters offering me to get 1 million dollars just to withdraw the money from her(his) father's (brother's) account using my bank account. üòä
I don't believe anything in this stupid movie."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"This film has received so much hype, my expectations were set that this was going to be the best film of the year, upon watching it, it isn't even the best film I've seen this year. The social justice preaching was nowhere near as bad as I anticipated, In fact the film was critical of both oppression by whites and also the failings of Wakanda to help other black people.
I would recommend for anyone that is into Superhero movies, although there aren't as many big superhero moments as you would expect."
BLACK PANTHER,22 December 2018,1/10,I could animate better using microsoft powerpoint. it is the most predictable movie ive seen over the past few years.
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,7/10,"SPOILER: Old King dies.
Heroic eldest son crowned new King.
Previously unknown evil blood relative claims crown.
Hero defeated, loses crown.
New evil Regent plans a reign of death and destruction.
Hero wins the day with help from his Scooby Friends.Is this Black Panther or Thor Ragnarok? Well, both.I don't expect a Shakespearean drama from a superhero movie, but it's a bit lax to use the same exact plot two films in a row.Dull, lifeless characters I really didn't care much about. Black Panther's sister was the only one with any ounce of personality. The main villain was cardboard and one dimensional, Andy Serkis in his small amount of screentime was a much more interesting villain.Overall it's watchable but also instantly forgettable, certainly not a top-tier MCU film. It looks good in general, barring a couple of ropey fighting scenes. The final battle on the grasslands did give me Phantom Menace flashbacks.And that is never a good thing. Just ask Jake Lloyd."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,1/10,"Seriously - WHY does Hollywood think that film lovers do NOT want characters to have a value? Both old and young people want to fall in love with the characters in movies - or the opposite for antagonists. In this movie they spend maybe 30 seconds building up the characters, if even that. They just assume that we will have feelings to any character who pops up in the movie - BUT WE DON'T. If anyone fights, almost dies and in the end dies anyways we just do not care since we do not get to know the person. Forrest Whitaker acts is but off yet you do not care if he dies... WHO is he, tell us something about him before please (!).Same thing goes for the rest. Seriously, a movie with 99% effects and 1% emotions is NOT a good balance.AND WHY ARE ALL CHARACTERS 100% STEREOTYPE??PS. They killed off the one character who did a good job acting:ANDY SERKIS, we all love you bro! Hope that you somehow come back in the next Marvel shajt-movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,10/10,"Awesome Addition to the Marvel Universe, and great family night movie. This movie was awesome and had my 8 year old bouncing on the edge of his seat with excitement and had thrills for my husband and myself as well.. so it was definitely worth seeing"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"This movie was in no way the worst of all the Marvel films, but it does lack originality. I'm hearing many people say that this film is unique and separates itself from the rest of the marvel installments. I really don't know what they're on about. The plot is really generic. In a way it's as if we've all seen this film before, just rehashed with better, (well, ""better"" CGI). A man comes and visits his home to take the throne over his father's kingdom. Once he becomes king, another fellow family member decides to dethrone him (for his own reasons). The villain humiliates the protagonist, conquers the land for some time, and then the hero returns to kill him off. T'challa himself wasn't a very lovable character, I found him to be very bland and lacking of expressions. Kill monger is probably the reason this movie wasn't a complete catastrophe, although there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about him, he was quite charismatic and enjoyable to watch. I really couldn't care less about him dying in the end, seeing as if he was gone missing for like 50 minutes of the movie. Not only that, but let's be honest everyone saw it coming. This film was predictable from start to finish, maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it too much. The jokes were cheesy, maybe one or two landed. My final complaint was the pacing of the film. It all started really fast and then about 20 minutes in to halfway through the film, the movie was really slow. Not even the CGI could help make things better
I only saw this film because I'm a Marvel fan, (or was from the previous movies). It really was what I expected though. Some cool action sequences, a predictable plot, typical cheesy Marvel jokes, and just another fill in for the continuation of the Avengers storyline."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,"No surprise, no suspense, but Lion King, 007 and mindless boredom, Disney (after Star Wars) also definitely killed Marvel Universe, Spiderman, Thor, Jessica Jones all dead. There is no need for Thanos."
BLACK PANTHER,15 August 2018,5/10,"I was genuinely excited for this film when they announced Ryan Coogler, the director of Creed, (one of the best films I saw in 2016) was going to be in the director's chair. But man, did Coogler misfire badly here. Badly filmed action, mostly under baked characters, rushed pacing, too many awkward moments, cringe humour, and some laughably bad CGI in the final battle. The only good things were Michael.B Jordan's great acting and Ludwig Gorransson's great score. Bland slop, don't believe the hype. I don't love the MCU, but they have put out stuff that's light years ahead of this."
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,1/10,"Slow, boring, tiring. I see they funded critics, and the perfect score people here on social media to prop up ratings, they should have funded an interesting story instead."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,7/10,"Story line is the essence of the success of this movie.
I am completely astounded by the trending of my neighborhood mimicking the Wakanda cultures and english dialect.I am not racist, but this movie is still positively influential to the viewers."
BLACK PANTHER,23 July 2020,6/10,"I checked out some negative reviews before making my own opinion and I gotta say, I am probably not picking up on the negatives.It was an alright chill movie, not something I'd need to rewatch though. I liked it more than some of the other Marvel movies in fact because it did turn down volume on the humor, a lot - suits me. The characters and story weren't super deep nor something you haven't seen before but it was an alright evening entertainment to me. They were likeable and I am not aware of any plot holes so I am satisfied."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is certainly a good movie, but I don't feel like it truly capitalizes on its interesting premise and setting enough to elevate above other Marvel movies. It still follows the formula and doesn't stray far enough away from it to make truly distinct. However, I did love the action scenes (which there was surprisingly little of), Michael B Jordan as Killmonger (surprisingly good villain to be honest), pretty much all the Wakanda stuff, the soundtrack and the core story. I just wish it had been less restricted by the studio. Black Panther is a good film, but it could've been a great one, which is disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,As most reviewers have stated a bit lower than 4/10 action was all right in places. Actors were not believable and one place silent shoes became loud when he ran up a ramp. not a good movie and I am sure Marvel can do much better as they have in the past. just saying
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,9/10,"After years of the same Marvel movie over and over (aside from a couple slight detours), Cooglar has managed to meaningfully evolve the Marvel formula. Black Panther is alive and fresh. The villain is brilliantly developed and actually inspires change in our protagonist (good writing 101). The visuals are wonderfully lush and varied. I've seen it twice already. This is a film worth rewatching."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther started quietly and with familiar faces and on familiar territory. Soon though, began to emerge, one after the other, these Black, Beautiful, Powerful, Graceful, Masterful characters, garbed in colorful and magical, tribal yet futuristic outfits (some resembling the Masai people,) in this fantastical land that is at once futuristic, highly Scientifically/Technologically advanced, and yet at the same time has managed to remain grounded in its ancient and tribal roots/ways. The cast selection was simply impeccable. Chadwick Boseman was a perfect pick for a King. His cool temperament and charisma coupled with his physical/mental/emotional/spiritual strength made him outstanding! The women in the rolls of Shuri/Nakia/Okoye/the Queen Mother and the whole Dora Milaje were phenomenal! From their physiques, to their masterly warrior skills, to their loyalty and love for their people and the country, to their fabulous costumes and accents, they present a wonderful array of what is black-feminine-beautiful-strong-fully evolved/mature- and committed.
The movie is packed with powerful visuals, action, and content. It offers so much that is new and different on so many levels. So, naturally my fist viewing experience was overwhelmed with just taking in the visuals and keeping up with the action as best as I could. The dense content will take time and hopefully more viewings to untangle. Overall, Black Panther, not only did it not disappoint, it inspired, it united, it healed, and I have to say after this introduction to Marvel I will now be on the lookout for similar releases in the future!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 September 2018,8/10,I was most surprised by the crystal clear and seamless CGI in this film. Very well done! I do feel as if the sonic clarity could have used some work.
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,7/10,"I think the movie is fine. Surprisingly, the score fits with the scenes better that I ever thought a score with that much snare drum could. I like the look of the interior scenes, everything outside looks fake as hell. The tech feels fresh, and kinda interesting, which is hard to do after this many years of superhero movies. The action is fun sometimes, though I could do without the bad CGI. Overall, its a fine marvel movie. And don't say marvel took a daring risk when they made this, this was clearly a calculated move to get everyone with a specific political opinion into the theater. Its not like they didn't know that the controversy would generate box office sales. Its a fine movie. Enda story."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2019,1/10,I'm wondering if the next year's Oscar awards will have Iron Man vs Godzilla nominated for the best movie or best entertaining movie or whatever category. Have you seen Idiocracy? The producers of the movie should set up a movie festival because they'll have plenty of candidates for it. Black Panther gets a 1 because of being nominated for the Academy awards.
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,1/10,"After 3 straight comedies (GotG2, SMH, and Ragna-joke), MCU tried to copy DCEU by making a serious movie. But if Black Panther is supposed to be a serious movie, then Black Panther is a HUGE FAIL because Black Panther doesn't make any sense at all.1. T'Chaka flew his aircraft to a neighborhood in Oakland at the beginning and T'Challa did the same thing at the end. The US government wouldn't just allow a foreign aircraft to fly over US airspace (especially after 9/11) and hover over or land in a US city. So Wakanda violated US airspace.2. T'Chaka tried to arrest his brother and take him back to Wakanda for execution. Even if his bother did break the law, he's on American soil and T'Chaka has no jurisdiction to arrest him on American soil. T'Chaka would have to request the US government arrest his brother and extradite him to Wakanda. But the reason T'Chaka didn't do that and instead tried to covertly take his brother back to Wakanda for execution is because T'Chaka was afraid his brother would request political asylum from the US government.3. T'Chaka kills his brother and just leaves without taking his brother's body back and giving him a proper burial. Even if T'Chaka has diplomatic immunity, he just killed someone on American soil so by law he still needs to report that to the US authorities. Instead, T'Chaka just leaves his brother's dead body there for his young son to find. Imagine a young child finding his father's dead body like that!4. Klaue was arrested on Korean soil. Why the hell would the Korean authorities allow an American CIA agent (basically an American spy) and a Wakanda national to question a suspect arrested on Korean soil?5. Why would the Korean government allow T'Challa to take a wounded American spy to Wakanda? 1 MCU fan said that South Korea is on friendly terms with the US, but that's irrelevant. He's not only an American citizen but an American CIA agent. The US government might not want a wounded CIA agent transported to a country that Americans aren't even allowed to visit and potentially drugged or tortured to reveal state secrets.6. Since T'Challa accepted Killonger's challenge and Killmonger defeated T'Challa in combat, Killmonger was the rightful King of Wakanda. So the American CIA agent was basically participating in an illegal coup against the rightful King of Wakanda when he helped T'Challa take back the throne. Shouldn't the rogue CIA agent call Langley first to check if he has permission from POTUS to participate in an illegal coup against the rightful King of a foreign nation and potentially involve the US in a war that POTUS might not want? After all, POTUS might prefer having a former American soldier on the throne of Wakanda.7. If Wakanda had all that medical technology/process to heal people and save lives, then why did T'Challa just let Killmonger die when T'Challa could've saved him? Because Killmonger didn't want to be in prison? But why would Killmonger be in prison? Killmonger didn't break any of Wakanda's laws. Killmonger was the uncle's real biological son so Killmonger wasn't an imposter. Killmonger challenged T'Challa for the throne, which Killmonger had a legal right to do by Wakandan law, and T'Challa accepted. Killmonger defeated T'Challa in combat so Killmonger was the rightful King of Wakanda according to Wakandan law. And as the rightful King of Wakanda, Killmonger had the legal right by Wakandan law to order his army and his ships to go outside Wakanda and wage war. So what Wakandan law did Killmonger break? Why would Killmonger be put in prison when he didn't break any Wakandan laws? Is it just normal policy that the King of Wakanda can just throw anyone in a Wakandan jail just because they challenged the King?8. If Wakanda is supposedly the most technologically advanced nation in the world, then why are they still resorting to a medieval and barbaric and savage ritual of choosing a leader by violence and bloodshed and mortal combat? Is no one in Wakanda smart enough to come up with a peaceful way in the 21st century to choose a leader that doesn't involve violence and bloodshed and mortal combat, especially when most of the rest of the world has already done so?9. If Wakanda wanted their King to prove himself worthy to lead the nation, then why would decide their King by mortal combat? Wouldn't a supposedly technologically advanced nation want to choose a King who is the smartest rather than just choose a King who has the most brute strength?Black Panther is just another over-hyped and over-rated MCU movie that is full of awful writing."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,1/10,"I wanted to see what this whole hype was all about.
After watching it - disappointed - As if a 12 year old wrote a script and a 13 y/o directed.
On par with the Iron Fist.
Very poor....."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Black panther is not all about the action but it's all about the humanity of a true KING.and it's also a very beautiful 3d movie.Marvel done a great job again.someones say that the movie is boring but they're wrong.this is a very big cinematic work.and the plot is really good.no doubt marvel movies are so better than DC movies.and watch this beautiful comic movie and it's really Awesome!!!!
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,3/10,"Overrated asf. Story was mildly interesting but people like it's ""relevance"" more than its quality.."
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2021,5/10,"Plenty of action. Just falls flat 30 mins in. Too many stereotypes and racist comments to be better then a 5 star. Remember Blade in the 90's. Ground breaking action, great action the way a marvel movie should be."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,8/10,"I saw Black Panther today and I came out happy. It had a really nice story with a lot of heart and overall gave us a new experience. 
The whole cast was great and thanks to them and the directing team they have made a very good addition to the Marvel family. 
Fight scenes were pretty and the combination of technology was very cool.I did feel it jumped a bit too much in certain scenes.
However I was worried, I found that recent Marvel films like Thor tried to hard to give us a comedy and failed with other emotions. 
Spiderman homecoming was good but for me it had a few issues like every character had to be funny except Spiderman and he suddenly lost his ability to use his suit despite being incredible in Civil War. But I came out surprised and happy with Black Panther! So overall I am giving it an 8 
The reason I didnt give it a 7 is because this is the last film before Infinity Wars so the Hype is at a new level!!!!Hope you enjoy this honest review 
Enjoy Black Panther And most importantly enjoy Infinity Wars!"
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,5/10,"This film, is at least, on par with any above average Marvel films. If you would like to have a typical cliche Marvel blast, without harboring any ulterior perception of the world, then this is for you.The 10 stars or 1-2 stars reviews are both inaccurate, however, the 1-2 stars and the reviews may not only be a division of opinions about this film, which is a sad thing.With that said that, this film did fail its premise that it would outreach to the world to amend the greater divide, thus I only gave it a 5. The film itself would be 7.5 worthy though."
BLACK PANTHER,27 November 2018,4/10,"I think this film's has garnered so much popularity due to its casting, producing a nearly all black cast is wonderful to see, signs that this industry is moving in the right direction becoming more diverse. However while this is wonderful to see, it doesn't make a good movie. That comess down to the story telling, direction and acting.Michael B. Jordan I thought was just terrible, he delivered his lines in such an awkward way I couldn't not laugh at a few of them. Chadwick Boseman I thought was good, although he was definitely given a much better character to work with in like Jordan's who I thought just wasn't written well enough. The film relies too much on visual effects, I must've seen this film at least 2 or 3 times and just can't really remember the ending, it's just not memorable. Andy Serkis for me was the standout performance though his was short but sweet, he made a good villain again unlike Jordan compare the two and Jordan comes up 2 dimensional, easy to suss and forgettable.I personally didn't enjoy the film nearly as much as other people I just saw as 2 hours of visuals that was there to pave the way for Infity war, forgettable story and characters, to see this consistently ranked best marvel film absolutely baffles i'd place it in the lower tier, hopefully the second will be better."
BLACK PANTHER,7 October 2018,7/10,"Amazing acting,good cgi and origin story and a perfect villian.Movie is somewhat like dark knight rises but has some differences.
Only bad thing about the movie is bad jokes, we all know marvel loves dad jokes. 
Also how dare you call guns uncivilised."
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2018,5/10,"Political agenda and race notions aside, this is just another Marvel action movie introducing a new character to the movie universe.If you've seen any other Marvel movie, you pretty much know what to expect. Lot of action and comedic one liners with a predictable plot. Black Panther doesn't do much to make it stand out against other Marvel movies.It's personally one of the weaker movies in the series though Wakanda was pretty to look at."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,4/10,Saw this film after lot of hype and was defiantly overrated
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,5/10,"This movie is great of all the tribal people's of the world. Seeing hi tech combined with tribal royalty is interesting to say the least. Is this where we're headed? Forward to the past? Who can say..The plot was pretty stock standard. Plenty of stuff I'd seen before. Maybe because I'm white I didn't get the full movie effect. Listening to a black woman saying ""another white boy to save"" and getting a huge laugh seems a little strange when white people are soundly condemned for saying that to other races. I guess equality isn't for everyone.This movie will make loads of money, so I expect to see more tribalism in the near future from Hollywood."
BLACK PANTHER,4 August 2018,4/10,"So considering that this film had such great ratings I thought it was about time to talk about this film. Please note that the 7/10 is subject to change. I decided that this movie deserved an 7/10 because of how it has many real world conflict affiliations. It gave motivation to every charcter and allowed you to not be wary of rooting for the bad guys sometimes because of how down to earth their motivations are. However there are many problems that for some could bring this movies rating down to a 6 or even 5 out of 10. These include a lack of suspense. There is a point in the movie where you really will feel that there is zero risk for the good guys to lose. Despite the noir being pretty well paced and the action being very well done, problems like the lack of suspense really bring the movie down. I suppose the movies main redeeming quality is just how fun and action packed it is. It's just a really good time.Hope you enjoyed my review and have a great time"
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2019,4/10,"I mean, the acting is pretty good throughout, but nothing about the movie is all that interesting. Yeah its take on modern politics is cool but when its shoved down your throat in such an unclever way it gets annoying. I don't really sugest it, you wont get much enjoyment from it, but some people really like this, and ill admit first seeing i kind of liked it. If your into this stuff, give it a try."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"This movie left me in awe because the way the role of each character illustrated how powerful black people are especially when we come together as well. Wakanda, a beautiful and exquisite country, led by 5 clans was more technologically advanced than any other country and giving Africa the reputation of being supreme and powerful technologically was bold and called for. Currently, this is not the case but Africa deserves to be since the beginning of life started from the motherland. 
In addition, I am really thankful and grateful for the fact that the black females in this movie played a HUGE role in the saving of Wakanda and the women were very assertive and definitely had power of the men in some ways. The females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous and definitely had tremendous loyalty with Wakanda. This was a great all around movie with great action and story line as well."
BLACK PANTHER,16 October 2020,10/10,"Thanks for a wonderful performance even while battling cancer. Few people could've done what you did and even fewer could've done it with such panache.
This movie doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, I agree, but it doesn't deserve all those 1's and 2's from the haters either. It remains to this day, one of the best standalone Marvel movies ever made.
You'll be sorely missed. Black Panther is amazing, it has outstanding performances, amazing soundtrack, great action sequences, great humor, beautiful costumes, marvelous villain, and amazing story!! A negative here is the CGI, at times it's good, but at times it's messy and looks bad. Overall, BP is one of Marvel's best films ever made. Rest in Power, Chadwick üëë. The King has now rested. Don't know how I will relay this news to my kids. Especially my daughter, she loved Black Panther so much. Great talented cast. On a comic book level, this movie was very worthy. That's what we wanted especially when it comes to Marvel. Chadwick Boseman will always be King T'Challa. Will be hard to replace him. Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"I sat at the movies on preview night with a full audience of laughing and impressed viewers. Including my husband and daughter- not am easy crowd to please. Marvel has walked the fine line between continuity with the Marvel universe and ingenuity. They took the formula that is distinctly Marvel, mixed it with the basis of the Black Panther storyline and added a modern twist. The cinematography in a second to none and while the fight scenes were by no means the focal point of the movie they were none the less epic. You can't take anything away from this movie without purposely throwing shade on what Marvel and the director Retrying to accomplish. We went into this movie with high expectations and I can Say unequivocally that we were not disappointed. We were pleasantly surprised with spider man homecoming and its unintentional inclusivity and blown away by Black Panther's meaningful, thoughtful and purposeful redefining of everyone's view of what it can mean to be African. They blew away every stereotype, while remaining true to the comic.For people that say was predictable I say you put them in a catch-22 because if they veer from the Marvel story line then there's no continuity and it's not authentically Black Panther. They managed to tell the story, tell it well, make it beautiful , make it believable and make it congruous in such a way that you can have a Black Panther 2,3 and 4, and he can come back and join the Avenger as needed.
They captured the technological marvel that vibranium can bring when harnessed with the genius that Black Panther was known for, though they ascribed that genius to an independent, youthful little sister. Great twist there.
Someone complained about the single remote controlled plane, well Iron Man could have made multiple suits but he only made 1 to share with his wingman. In the same way, Shuri didn't water down her technology by putting it on am assembly line. 
To those who complained about them fighting their own people. Yea, think about it. Who else could even hold a prayer of matching wits and weapons with them. The Claw already made the point in the first fight scene. "" Those are vibranium cars, Idiots. Your bullets are useless."" The General brought the point home when the rhino stopped charging and smooches her face instead. That was Her Rhino to command. They took the theme of Civil War- or pained me to see The Avengers fighting each other tooth and nail- and made it even more personal. This was family against family and friend against friend. Having never read the comics, they evoked the same feelings of remorse for the fight that Civil War did in a single movie. That takes serious character development. 
And yes I had a tough time believing that T'Challa's life long friend would turn so quickly but many of us have experienced misplaced loyalties. He got caught up in the movement for all the wrong reasons.
I've seen enemy Avenger movie on the big screen except Guardians and Fantastic Four and this topped them all. Hands down. 
No one is peperfect and this IS a superhero movie- a genre not known for being deep- but this one went there. Rightfully so. They needed to go a little deep. They needed to explore the taboo subject of responsibility. Black Panther was breaking new ground when it came out in the comics. The movie had to live up to the legacy. Paving the way. Like Jackie Robinson. When you're first, you have to blaze the trail for everyone that follows. This movie set the bar high. I can't wait to see Falcon star in his breakthrough movie."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2018,6/10,"I honestly wanted this movie to be great but found it was subpar to other superhero movies that have came out in the past, and to keep it short, I thought Michael B Jordan's acting performance was god awful and I'm surprised less people have said this."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,2/10,"If you have seen ""The Lion King"", then don't bother wasting your money on this one. It was almost entirely the same script. The star is a great actor, but this movie should have never made so much money. I can chalk this one up along with ""Avatar"" (Dances with Wolves) as a stolen script that made a ton."
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,7/10,"The movie was ok...The acting was very subpar especially from Michael B. Jordan. Where was the emotion from the male actors in this film? The female performances were much better. I have to say the fighting scenes were o.k., but not much of a wow factor. This could of been a lot better, along with the C.G.I. The story line and Black Panther following his moral compass were the bright spots in this film. It was shot very well with beautiful background shots. This is my least favorite Marvel film, it did have a moral plot though."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,6/10,I thought that this film was well done visually speaking as well as acting. But the story is just so predictably boring. It's just one cliche after another.
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,,"I can't say this movie's perfect, because it's not. However, it's better than most. So let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons. Let's stay positive for a minute. The costumes, designs, music, and acting is all really good. I especially like Michael B. Jordan's performance. It was a different beat to everyone else in the film. This movie is also a lot more colorful than most Marvel movies, which are typically kinda drab. This one pops with colors, much like Thor: Ragnarok and the Guardians movies, so that's great. Now let's get to the part you've been waiting for: the villain. Killmonger is probably my favorite MCU villain so far (I haven't seen Infinity War yet, so I can't say anything about Thanos). The main reason I like him is not so much the motivation, but the impact he has on Black Panther. Killmonger's vision makes T'Challa change his mindset, which no other MCU villain has ever done. The things I didn't like. The CGI was not always good. In some scenes, it looked like PS2 graphics, which is embarassing. This is my only big complaint with the movie. Overall, this is not the best MCU movie, but it's definiteky not the worst. It's probably in my top five."
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,8/10,"With all the hype leading up to the film, I definitely had some high expectations of the film. Although it may not be the best Marvel movie, it still was an exceptional film!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2018,1/10,"What is going on??? Film vastly overrated. Storyline makes no sense, bad acting, women are subservient, sexist, bad acting, etc."
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,2/10,Its alright but not nearly as good as all the hype is about. I don't get why this has such a good review from critics maybe just because its a marvel movie. Good visual effects and acting from Jordan peele but that's about it. Story line horrible.
BLACK PANTHER,25 August 2018,5/10,"I'll start with the pluses, because they are few. The picture is incredibly beautiful (who would doubt, because the budget for the film is huge) and I'm not talking about the graphic component (it is performed at medium-high level), but about landscapes, suits and so on. That's all pluses. In the negative, I will not go into details. The protagonist is the personification of despondency. The main villain, though well played by Michael Bi Jordan, is a complete copy of the black panther in strength, differing only in color. By the way, the main villain and protagonist are invulnerable in their costumes. Empathizing for someone in this regard is very difficult. Further on the list is the fact that this film is a filler. that is, all the events of this film have no significance for the entire movie world. I could name even more minuses of this film, but I doubt that anyone will ever read my review. On this all, all love!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,6/10,"HONEST SHORT REVIEW;Understandable Ultra Hyped Movie. You will enjoy the fun, the action and the dialogues sometimes, but overall is a Cinematographic nonsense. 
The best characters of the movie don't get enough screen-time, the average ones, get some time, and the awe full ones, will be present most of it. It's a parallel world from other Marvel movies, so don't expect any similarities. Including CGI. It's overused and sometimes really bad. I did not engaged with 99% of the characters including BP, that's too sad. I came out of the movie theatre with a weird feeling. Conclusion: It was like ending in bed with the hottest guy/girl in the club, just to discovered that your ex was way better. Confusing."
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2019,9/10,"Black PantherT'Challa: ""In times of crisis, the wise build bridges while the foolish build barriers.""The 18th film in the franchise and boy was we in for a treat!
One of the many, many positives I read about this was as followed:Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories-and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.I had to put that paragraph in there, what more can you say? The film got universal acclaim! Everyone loved it and so they should! It's fresh, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's emotional the list goes on and on!
This film is an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present!
An absolute triumph!
Wakanda Forever"
BLACK PANTHER,22 October 2018,7/10,"Black Panther stands out from all of the other MCU entries by taking a deep dive into culture, and making a villain who isn't necessarily the bad guy. Everyone on the cast does a really great job of bringing the characters to life. They aren't two-dimensional, and have rich backstories, that aren't cliche. My favorite part of this movie has to be Micheal B. Jordan as Killmonger. He does a really good job of portraying someone who has dealt with a tremendous loss in thier life, and is fueled by grief and rage. It's nice to see a villain who isn't really a villain, just a person who is doing bad things, but for (to some) good reason. The film itself is visually stunning, with long drawn out scenes of sunsets, and skylines. Unfortunately, the green screen effects don't always work, and that is a big disappointment, especially when some of the scenes are breathtaking. I personally don't love the films ending, but that didn't really make the movie any less enjoyable. This is one of my favorite Marvel movies so far."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,10/10,"It's not only a superhero movie! It is a mark being set, it represents. This movie is important."
BLACK PANTHER,11 October 2020,3/10,"What was that ? Idea might be good, but again and again, Marvel is just si boring..."
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2019,2/10,"I've never before wished to be deaf or blind, and yet halfway through this movie... there I found myself ...... wishing...."
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2019,1/10,"Seriously, they reference another Marvel movie like, twice. It's pretty much just a random, rasict movie about Black Superiority. Bad CGI, No real plot. "" Ok so we got some vibranium, some people want to share it, some don't. The End"" Do they seriously need a sequel? Just watch the whole scene after the killmonger guy is in his throne after burning the flowers. Totally rasict. Only African American actors, white people are treated like rubbish."
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2020,7/10,"When the film released it was praised as an exceptional film that does the African American community justice. Imo ONLY the character T'Challa does the community justice. A lot of the practical shots blending futuristic architecture with ancestral scenery were captivating. The script and plot are laser focused so the film moves seamlessly. It's technically good not bad. Where I think the film falls short is it's soundtrack, underwhelming action sequences, use of cgi and Michael B Jordan's overacting in some scenes. Hip hop as a score doesn't draw the same emotion as contemporary or Orchestral soundtracks and would've preferred hip hop being an addition to rather than a focus giving an amateurish feeling... and I love hip hop, but just not as a way to set tone. A cringeworthy scene is when Killmonger gets in the ambulance and makes out with his side chick. LOL and the cgi in almost all instances at no point garnished a realistic impression. Unlike the Whedon or Russo entries it felt like a cut and paste superhero flick. I can praise the film on presenting an Influential antagonist, strong performance by Chadwick, cinematography and the effective pacing. I will revisit this film."
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,2/10,"How to describe the fake accents? Imagine trying to make a New York mob film where all the actors speak in a Texan accent. No two characters speak with the same faux-African accent. Felt very sorry for the actors having to say lines in that faux accent. Can't think of any more cringe worthy moment for the very talented cast. Then there is the complete disregard of actual African regions and differences. 
Zulus wearing face paint? With designs from sub-Saharan Africa?? 
Boko Haram schoolgirls transplanted across the entire breadth of the continent? 
And yet somehow this film was hyped as somehow authentic to African culture."
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2019,8/10,"Overall Blank Panther is a good, well put together film. The acting and casting are done well in this movie. Kill Monger is a good villain who's motives make sense. Some of the fight sequences are great such as the waterfall tribal fights. But the final fight with Kill Monger and Black Panther is horrible. It looks worse than a lot of the video games that are out nowadays. This movie would have benefited from more practical effects. All in all a good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,12 August 2019,3/10,The thing is I don't see a movie. I see a bad screenplay. Bad script!
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2019,7/10,"I loved black panther more in civil war, endgame, and infinity war but after seeing is own movie it wasn't that great it was too hyped"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,4/10,"Let's start by saying acting was good. But visuals sucked. And story was like a copy of Lion King. My least favorite marvel studios film. Felt out of place to other marvel films, the only thing that tied it to the others was the end credits. Best part of the movie was Michael B Jordan's acting, on point. Sorry bandwagon I am not jumping on this one."
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2020,9/10,Marvel movies that seriously due to their great anomaly deserved more .. although for me the best in terms of CGI is Dr. Strange
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2021,3/10,With all the excellent reviews I was expecting an amazing movie but it was one of the worst marvel films. The cgi was good but the plot was terrible and way too predictable!
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2021,7/10,An amazing superhero movie to come off of after civil war and a great way to begin or end your day.
BLACK PANTHER,22 June 2021,10/10,I can't even say anything about the others peoples reviews. The movie is the best marvel movie ever.
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2021,9/10,Veeeerrrrrrrrrrryy goooooooooooood mmmmmmmoooooooovvvvvvvvviiiiiiiieeee.
BLACK PANTHER,1 May 2020,5/10,"Mediocracy at it best!!!!
I really don't get all the hype over this movie!
The only good thing in this was Smegol( Andy Serkins)!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,4/10,"Where as I was so excited about the Black Panther, I was disappointed, I wanted to ask for my money back Predictable, bad acting, and thin story.. All while the music director only knew how to play African drum beats from a PBS special. As with all Marvel Films, the effect were good. But...there was nothing original, nothing made this superhero anything different then what we've already seen. What gives, it had a huge budget, and could have been a great piece, but it falls short on many levels. If the cast were not colored, this would have been panned by the critics and word of mouth would let it die a quiet death. I appreciate the attempt, and still feel Black Panther is still a great character but this film just made him a ""B"" film lead character, or a good supporting character at best. The Black Panther deserves better! Also, why take some of the most attractive woman in the word and shave their heads, does that pass as good acting now? AND... How did one of the Wayans children land the bad guy lead in the film, bad hair and all!I also have a hard time hearing about all this diversity, only to have either a while cast, or a black Cast.... Kind of wish it were more of a chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream cone... Both are good, but together, they are great.Wish I had waited and rented this film Redbox. it would have been worth it then."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,10/10,"It was mostly good, the action, acting, effects were all great, and the story was... mostly good. And as a history nerd, I love that Black Panther can pique the audiences' interest in the under-studied- but fascinating- African history! 
The story's logic, though, fell short regarding secret-keeping of Wakanda's technology:
-Why didn't they take Killmonger back to Wakanda after his father died? Wouldn't leaving him abandoned make a secret-revealing nemesis out of him? (Also, where's Killmonger's mother? Would she also have known about Wakanda's secret but also left untouched?)
-And the big high-tech action scene in South Korea would've easily exposed Wakanda tech to the world, topped with pedestrians broadcasting the whole thing on social media!
-And the biggest issue is Jabari! For millennia, they distrusted using Wakanda tech, mildly antagonist to Wakanda but ultimately harmless to them, and yet kept in the cover-wall of high-tech Wakanda? Realistically, anytime Jabari would've had a leader or two reveal the ""threatening Wakanda"" to outside neighbors- and knowing the inner workings of Wakanda's defenses- build a coalition to invade, conquer and/or destroy the high tech. It seems too unrealistic that they'd remain the cranky, reclusive hillbilly cousins all this time.But other than that, it was very good!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,4/10,"The only thing I liked about this movie is it's background score. Everything else about this is an expensive repackaging. Nothing more. 
Yes, yes, the whole Africa angle is cool, but what's with S.Korea and Marvel. I don't get it."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,5/10,"Before seeing this film, i was hoping it to differentiate itself from the rest of the MCU films.It didn't. It's simply a marvel movie, which isn't a compliment. The writing is mediocre. Characters are basic. You got your perfect hero, that doesn't have any character flaws. Love interest that does little to nothing. Villain that has a motivation that seems to change throughout the film. Any other character discussion would result in spoilers. There's a lot of cringe worthy lines. Bad jokes are littered throughout this film. And a lot of stuff that made me unintentionally laugh.The visual effects are quite bad. Black Panther looks rubbery, and plain fake. The MCU seems to look faker by each installment.The music is probably the only unique thing about this film. They used a lot of African Percussion and hip hop instrumentation, which is something i can appreciate. It adds to the atmosphere and helps make it somewhat unique.So when you watch this movie don't expect a well made film. Expect a formulaic movie that's only intention is to sell toys and sell tickets."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,2/10,"Nothing surprising, a very predictable story line, seems I waited all the time to see the post credit scenes, but it is also ..... !!!!!
For me this film is the worst of Marvel Films, by the way I hated Ant-Man, now I hate Black panther more !!!
The two start for all the girl characters and the action sequence in Korea.
If you're a marvel or superhero fan like me, then don't watch it with hope, it's a failure."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,1/10,"This movie is terrible, we WALKED OUT. Which we have not done ever in a movie. The acting is B rated at best. Obviously the ratings have been manipulated. The plot is weak and lacks action. If you are going to make a dialog movie, you have to hire actors and actresses that can ACT. Very disappointed that we where mislead by the FAKE stellar ratings for this National Geographic version of a Marvel comic. Dont waste your time."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,9/10,"Article contains spoilers!!!It's been a while since I went for a movie and the release of the last Marvel movie before the big release of the final chapter in Avengers - Black Panther - is a great reason for a movie night.Usually, I watch a movie with few expectations based on the trailer or teaser, however, Black Panther is a one off case. I didn't watch the trailer but just was following up on the release of the movie. Right from the beginning, the tone of the movie was set as slow and dark and it is evident that it is not going to be a run of the mill super hero movie. In my view, Chadwick Boseman is the perfect fit for the role of Black Panther. Yes, you might have seen him in action in Civil War, but, when you watch this movie, you will also accept what I just said - Puhfut fit for the role!!!The antagonist Micheal B Jordan, is also a perfect match to the role and I always believe that any movie will be great success if the antagonist has a meaty character and performs well.Since the movie is an adaptation of a comic book, the imagination of the director is unlimited. Be it the technology, weapons, vehicles - the movie showcases unimaginable concepts that are weaved into the screenplay to look believable. Kudos to the screenplay writer(s) who have ensured to show the mixture of advanced technology + the cultural diversities among people. The story-line is pretty much simple, one you would have seen it in multiple movies and whatever the director thought would create a surprise never really was there. In-fact, we were able to guess the next scene or sequence without much of a problem. But, as I usually say, guessing a sequence is easy but looking at the way it is conceptualized and taken to the big screen deserves an applause.One of the negatives that I felt about the movie is that many action sequences lacked clarity, especially the initial sequences - introduction of the Black Panther - was too dark. Also, the climax sequence - could have been a lot clearer if the action would have taken place elsewhere, just my thought.However, being an adaptation from a comic book, you just have to sit back and enjoy the movie and do not try to defy logic. There is no room for any logic in any super hero movie and it applies same to Black Panther as well. That's why, I have titled this article as Unlimited Imagination and I am sure after watching the movie, you will also agree to my view.Overall, on a Friday night, after a hectic week (be it at work or school), you can definitely watch Black Panther and enjoy the 140+ mins of Wakanda!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,5/10,"This movie kind of throws you into some world where some African village at some point found some kind of magic metal that can do anything and everything (read: plot device) and is now some secret technologically advanced city.Short of knowing the name, and hearing people raving about it I went in knowing nothing about Black Panther. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it more if I knew more of the backstory before hand.There was no real character development, short of the bad guy, and even then it's just a basic back story to explain why he's bad. The action wasn't really exciting. The CGI was pretty bad given the year and the money behind this.Maybe I've been spoiled by the trend of super hero movies kind of making fun of themselves and being partially comedies, but I found this boring and completely forgettable.It's not a movie I could ever see myself watching again, while most other recent Marvel movies I'd happily watch again. I was ready to give up 30 minutes in, but with the hype I assumed it would get better. It did not."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Given the hype that surrounds this movie I wasn't surprised to see it's just a mediocre flic at best.
What's more shocking is the no bad review crusade, really? I'm glad I live in a country in which I'm not afraid to voice my opinion, be it bad or good.
This movies is loaded to the brim with every trope of the genre, up to the point it feels ridiculous.
If the movie would have steered away from this leftist and PC insanity, and tried to stay faithfull to the source material it would have made a good movie.
But what it does is that it tries to be all things and all people, while pleasing none.
As a final note to the delusional people, this isn't the first black superhero movie: Blade trilogy, Luke Cage, Nick Fury etc."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2019,7/10,"The idea behind the movie is great, environment design is spectacular, unique, and very well made, characters are occasionally interesting but not particularly developed, the plot is completely generic and predictable. CGI is very obvious, but usually well executed and of high studio-quality.Cross-movie character interactions are well done and interesting as usual. I had strong hopes throughout the movie, waiting for it to depict how Wakanda fits into the rest of the world, only for it (after half-finished attempts) to ultimately give up on trying to chase this potentially interesting idea, and instead fall back to a very generic, overused, and predictable ending. For me, this part would've been the most interesting, and coupled with the environment design, these half-finished attempts basically account for all the good in this movie.The movie, in general, is enjoyable but also vastly overrated by critics, most likely due to completely unneeded political motivations. It's a good watch, but nothing remarkable or memorable. It's nothing more than one of the already seen, weaker fillers in the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,3/10,"FInal words first: THIS IS A BAD MOVIE. Period.
A Marvel fan is writing this review.Now the review (or rather a request to Marvel): You don't make such movies Marvel. Movies that has cheesy moments of Glory among tragedies, which btw never felt like tragedies. It felt like I am watching a typical Bollywood family drama, where characters shed more tears than sweat while kicking bad guys bums.
I mean a son just lost his father and is going to be The King. He is also in desperate search of his father's assassin. Oh dear ! just imagine what kind of potential this movie had and Oh Marvel ! how could you make such a disaster out of it? Dad killed and responsibility ahead and the son is all cool and happy, making googly eyes for her beloved, flaunting like a dumb Tollywood movie protagonist, asking mother if she is happy that he is going to be a king now. SERIOUSLY!!!Dear Marvel, if you are making such movies to target highly populated melodrama watching geographies and earn a lots of money, then here are few words of wisdom ""You made your mark in such geographies by making movies like Ironman, CapAm, Avengers et all. Consolidate that mark. Don't just ride on their success to sell crap to us. You are The Marvel. Change for good not for money"""
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,7/10,"Have to say i enjoyed this movie which i watched today at the empire cinema... so i cant understand all the negative reviews to be perfectly ohnest.Andy Serkis plays a brilliant pest of a villain if ever i have seen one,fantastic crazy South African arms dealer played menacingly well and i hope to see him play his role again somewhere down the line with marvel.I also thought the storyline was great,kind of bounces off the lion king story in some ways but has good depth too.. i have to say tho that the one liners just didn't do it for me on this occasion.Good acting and casting,however Martin Freeman needs to work on his USA accent...or play UK agent status instead in the future,i also loved the new suit absorption idea...nice touch !All in all well done guys ! 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,5/10,"The movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but to be honest it was far away from the best I've ever seen.There is something original about it when we look through the eyes of a black society with only a few white people. I respect and like that idea... that's a big plus but honestly the movie is actually nothing more than a action-fantasy story in a Avatar-Batman-Star Wars mix. This is a Marvel movie for children cause it doesn't have to tell grown up people much. It's about entertainment and there is a big difference to ""BlackkKlansmen"" in the quality of story-telling, acting and message to people. This time it's about a black Superhero in a black society. I'm not hater of those movies but some of them are just really dumb. What I don't like if they try to make the concept get more serious. I find that ridiculous and feel like I'd rather watch a movie that doesn'T combine our world with Superhero worlds. This fantasy trying to become real which doesn't work to me. ""BlacKkKlansmen"" does address that rather directly which I prefer. This movie shouldn't be on the Oscars more like a typical action movies and get nominations in irrelevant categories like effects or sound editing but not for ""best picture"". This is ridiculously overrated and more relevant movies would be better in that category instead.I vote 5 stars which I think is actually too much. I feel that it is sympathetic concept somehow. But when I had to vote like this movie really was as experience I'd say 2-3 stars."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Wow, I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was simple but the story line was thought provoking. It could have used a bit more action scenes, especially highlighting the special weapons but the visuals were awesome. Somewhat cliche' and corny laughs but I never got bored and I was glued to the screen. My favorite Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"It was decent movie, but not overwhelming good as we all have been sold on. We get the background on T'Challa's life and the history of Wakanda which was nicely done. But the character background on Erik Killmonger was weak, as was the predictability on the inevitable final scenes."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"I have had the privilege to watch this movie twice this past weekend. The second time was in Baldwin Park, where I was surrounded by my fellow people of color. It was such a wonderful experience both times. The start of the movie is a bit jarring and rushed, but I am grateful that they included the mythology so early. All the main characters were amazing. Each relationship seemed solid and unique. The personalities felt real. The villains, what can I say? Klaue was a bit on the ridiculous side, serving as a comic relief almost. Still, his point of view added to the richness of the film. Being that ""those savages"" (Wakandians) did not deserve the riches that they possessed. There was no real reason given as to why he felt this way, but perhaps the point was to leave the reasons open enough for all the various reasons people feel entitled to another's things. Killmonger, what can I say about him? I felt for him. He was a tough villain to dislike, because, although his methodology/execution is very very flawed, his points are so very valid. Every now and then he would say a bit a dialogue which would cut deep into current issues. His last lines, which I believe went something along the lines of this: ""Just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped ship, because they knew that death was better than bondage"". Wow.....Again, Killmonger's actions were not redeemable, he became as much a monster as those he sought to destroy. He was so blinded by pain, anger, and rage, that he drew pleasure in the idea of one day giving it all back to a world so flawed that would subject a child to horrors and violence. No movie is perfect. In my opinion, some character's motivations were a bit exaggerated, (W'Kabi losing loyalty to his friend and going against his love because he was upset that his friend did not immediately succeed in delivering Klaue and Killmonger happened to). Some the effects were also questionable. But again, no movie is perfect.Shout out to M'Baku. Leader of the Jabari and King of sass. Yes, I'm done now."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"This is one of those movies where everyone, EVERYONE, tries their very best to look, sound and feel cool or badass, they try so hard that it actually becomes painful to watch.. the lame dialogue of the wakandans when referring to outsiders (to make whites feel the stigma of being minority) is poorly executed/delivered, that i laughed every time said dialogue is delivered..being over the top.. ok, i know every superhero movie is ""over-the-top"" in it's own right, but being ""over-the-top"" just so you can make a certain race feel good about themselves is actually --- pathetic.. what you now have is the opposite of the message this poor movie is trying to convey.. more and more people are now seeing this as a political movie, and a poorly developed one too."
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2018,8/10,"Let's face it, the MCU really isn't THAT great. How many of its films are actually great and memorable? Maybe 6? Out of 20! I think you can add this film to that list, though, despite its mamy issues. 
At a high level: the acting ranges from serviceable to great, the action is pretty good, CGI is a bit spotty at times, it has a great theme and music. Most of all, it has its own identity. Despite the weak and often cliched writing / story, and even thin characters, the film still has a mostly fresh feel given the African setting, culture, etc. that helps make it memorable, along with its villain (and his ridiculous plan) who actually leaves a serious ideological impact (somewhat like Baron Zemo, though more successful).7.75 / 10"
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,1/10,"I can't believe this is considered to be Marvel's best movie. Non existing characters, WEAK action, bad cgi.... childish plot....
Seriously, a waste of time...."
BLACK PANTHER,9 July 2018,8/10,"Great cast, great plot, great direction... finally a real inclusive movie. It was everything I were speckting"
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2018,7/10,"I am all for diversity but that's not the parameter to judge the quality of the movie. Black Panther's hype is mostly due to the diversity factor. That's the why the nine and ten stars reviews are flawed. But the one star reviews are even more ridiculous. Just because you expect the movie to be some way and it isn't, does that make it a bad movie? All the other levels become irrelevant and directly fall to one star? The snobs giving one stars and two stars because they didn't like the ten star reviews don't know what a review is. You are judging other people's reviews instead of the movie itself. Now, coming to the review. The story is pretty straightforward, the CGI is awful in many places, and the African accents are not accurate. The music, acting performances, and direction however are really good. It's a good movie. You can definitely watch it once."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,6/10,"The movie is based on Marvel's super hero Black Panther. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee (who appears for a minute in the movie) and writer-artist Jack Kirby in the sixties. 
I am not so much into action movies but I do like superheros and I have to say that this movie is enjoyable and visually very appealing. Had a good time in the cinema but still not my genre."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"With so many superhero stories, we all know the story: there is a good guy and some bad guys, but the good guy wins. 
But, this move is actually different enough to be interesting and exciting. It is colorful (spoiler: I love the costumes at the waterfall challenge scene). I like the distribution of male and female characters (very refreshing!). The scenery is a combination of fantastic and international. Acting is good. 
Good movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2018,5/10,This is a visually well-made B-Movie with involuntary funny bits and downright trashy moments. I lived some time in Nigeria so I couldn't help finding the Lagos accent of the main characters exhilarating. Not worth the movie ticket. Ok for watching it on a long flight.
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2020,2/10,"I can't help thinking this movie is nothing more than Hollywoods attempt to bring some colored balance in superhero country. Yes I know, this will surely start a whole discussion that has nothing to do with the movie itself, but hey...
The script and the story are poor, so is the acting in my opinion. It's like your watching a mash up of a Star Trek episode and Roots. And that's exactly my point. The whole thing looks so obviously politically correct it's just annoying. And Michael B. Jordan proves yet again he can't act."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,10/10,"Notable hand gestures, stunning outfits, exceptional music, talented cast, engaging story and beautiful imagery are subtle descriptions of the MCU's current installment. Black Panther makes it the MCU's 18th movie and 8th solo film; given the metric, it would have been natural to be experiencing diminishing returns or even fatigue from the studio but it is the total opposite. Black Panther had so many strong points which makes it hard to elaborate on one. I understand that they focused more on the politics as opposed to action but it remains endearing. The best characters were Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, T'Challa and N'Baku. Erik Kilmonger is a villain we've never experienced in the MCU before in which Marvel has been doing great in the villain department lately. Special mention to Ryan Coogler for his amazing work on this film, I could see the combination of his style and Marvel's formula during the film which resulted in a masterpiece. Since we've been introduced to the fictional world of Wakanda and its vibranium, high expectations are set for the sequel. Now the hype is geared towards AIW, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 10 years culmination."
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2018,7/10,"Very ""Marvel"" and I Love that, but a little too serious.
A small industrial country helping the US(!) with social problems?"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,5/10,"Story wasn't super one of a kind, but the first and second act established a lot of interest and mythos worthy of excitement. That is until the third act. It seemed the visual effects money was spent too much on the first two acts because by the last 45 mins there was very bad green screen backgrounds that didn't match the character lighting at all in some shots followed by some bad CGI. (There was a bit of this earlier but it was acceptable) The only other problem is the ending. T'Challa is a hypocrite! Killmonger wanted to expand Wakandas resources to help the rest of the world. Living in poverty while the Wakanda live gloriously infuriates him and this and the death of his father as a child, drives his character. T'Challa and the Wakandans are against allowing their resources to help those in poverty for fear of possible wars started with their technology. But once Killmonger is defeated, T'Challa turns around and opens Wakandas doors to the world. There was no reason Killmonger should been murdered by Black Panther (T'Challa) and the only reason there was a conflict is because Killmonger took the throne and presumably killed T'Challa, angering his family/friends and they took upon an act of revenge. How did this ending even get approved?"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"First of all, Kudos to a movie in which everything did not happen in & to USA.The music & visuals are just amazing. They actually have done a lot of research in showing African culture & tribes.But its not a Nat Geo Movie.As a Marvel superhero movie, this movie was just a dud.The ending was really really weird. The heros always fought without Black Panther strength so why is this movie names as Black Panther? The fights were short & lazy.Tech advancements are more of a gimmik then anything fantastic.I think the only reason this movie won so much praise is that it was a Pro African movie wherein their culture & life was shown."
BLACK PANTHER,3 February 2019,1/10,Hollywood is cramming stuff like this down our throats. This movie won awards? What a joke.
BLACK PANTHER,27 September 2018,5/10,"Seriously, he is bad in every movie I have seen him in. Someone in Hollywood is REALLY trying to push him, to maybe make him a new (another?) Will Smith, but he just is not it. Fantastic Four had some flaws but I think it could was watchable if not for him. In this movie, his ghetto, thug rhetoric is so out of place and painful. Yeah, I know, his character was born there, but he was also educated and trained as an elite soldier yet...just no. Others have rated and reviewed the hell out of this movie, There is nothing more I care to add that hasn't been said, other than quit casting Michael B. Jordan. McDonald's or maybe the local car wash has a job opening for him ,I am sure."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,10/10,"The movie is fun it has a down sides like certain story aspects but other then that it is a marvel movie, don't question how things work and sit back and enjoy."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,1/10,"With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,I really wanted to see this movie but wish I hadn't bothered.
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,5/10,"Not going to go into much detail here. But for the Marvel executive to come out and say this is the best movie to date it just nonsensical. The movie was boring, so was the story with a very rediculous looking final fight scene between Black Pather and Killmonger at the end. Looked like something out of Tron not marvel. I loved black panther in Civil War, but this entire movie just didn't work well. I understand we needed to be introduced to Wakanda before Infinity War, but this movie just felt forced. There were at least 6 or 7 Marvso movies better than this one. I can say it was better than iron man 3, but that's not really saying much, is it."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,4/10,"I like black panther, he is a badass character, but this movie was kind of boring to me. I dont know what it was exactly, but I just didnt enjoy it that much. Only at the end it picked up and was better. But definitely dont agree with some people hyping it. 
My favorite character is probably his sister :)"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"This movie is not a Marvel movie. If you think it's going to be like others, you are wrong. I don't think it rightly compares to Marvel's typical fare. I love the MCU, but this movie is in a category of It's own. I think that is why people are giving it low review numbers. (Plus, i've heard some people are intentionally trashing it, which is very sad.) The movie is beautiful visually. From the set, to the costumes. The CGI could be better in the fight scenes where he is Black Panther, but this is why I took away a star. Yet the story is what makes this more than a typical Marvel Superhero movie. It is a story about old traditions and new. The acting is superb!!! I've seen complaints and I am completely baffled by it. Angela is wonderful, I felt Chadwick's pain at Forrest's death, I understood Michael's hurt over being left alone. This is a drama movie with Action to support it, not the other way around. For that reason, It's not a Marvel movie in my eyes. It's more and phenomenal!! I saw it on Friday opening weekend and will take my Mom next weekend."
BLACK PANTHER,13 October 2020,1/10,"Racism and ""Black supremacy"" messages from beginning to end. If the race roles were reversed, the Black community would be up in arms about this film. Notice how when he steals the artefacts from the Museum, the black character doesn't commit any violence or theft himself, no, he bought along a white (South African) do do the violent theft, you know, just to avoid the black stereotype and project it onto the Whites. Another scene where they are wondering if they should share their technology and help refugees is laughable. In a car chase, a black warriors says about the whites she is chasing ""shooting guns, how primitive"" but then she proceeds to throw a spear at them. all the ""bad characters"" in the film are whites.this is pure projection psychology but the joke is totally on them."
BLACK PANTHER,15 December 2019,10/10,I have seen almost every one. I am a big fan of marvel but the was by far the best. The story line was very creative and the action was impressive.
BLACK PANTHER,3 January 2019,1/10,The plot was awful and the cgi looks like a playstation 2 game
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,10/10,"I definitely went into this movie with high expectations because it's a marvel movie of course & it's FREAKING BLACK-PANTHER!!! I was not bored at ALL!! The story was fantastic, screenplay was amazing as well & the cast was great but I really really wished that Michael B. Jordan was the Black Panther instead of Chadwick Boseman..Chadwick definitely nailed it as Black Panther but in my opinion, Michael B.Jordan would have done better as Black Panther but Michael did nail it as a villain and as well as Chadwick nailed as Black Panther.I myself am a huge MARVEL fan & this movie is a great great addition to the Marvel Film's Franchise..Definitely will be buying this on Blu-Ray/4K to rewatch this amazing masterpiece!!The VFX in this movie was unbelievable..I really wished that I watched it in 3D because I think this movie is meant to be watched in 3D & I did the same mistake with Thor Ragnarok which is another masterpiece..GO WATCH BLACK PANTHER IN 3D IF U CAN!!  DONT MISS THIS IN THEATRE'S!! STILL SHOWING IN CINEMAS!! U'RE GOING TO LOVE IT!!! & I give Black Panther a 10/10..TRUST ME GO WATCH THIS MOVIE.."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,Not much to say here. I was only able to sit through the first half hour before shutting this horrible piece of ¬£*¬®% off.Some questions that I now have & you should begin to have when starting to watch this waste of time & money:why do you need to do everything with CGI when you can have a real background that is cheaper to film?who would rate this higher than 2 stars?why does everybody in Africa speak English like Eddy Murphy in Coming to America?why does Marvel think this movie isn't an insult to my intelligence?
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2018,10/10,"Very well written, the acting was great and special effects were amazing, I definitely recommend seeing the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2019,4/10,"I am not a Marvel fan, but I can enjoy most Marvel movies. After I read the reviews and saw the nominations of this movie i was actually for the first time since Avengers 2 interested in a Marvel movie. However after about 15 minutes in the film i started to feel, that all the reviews and nominations were probably not for an artistic reason.I have three central problems with the film:
1. It is full of CGI
2. I do not care about the characters
3. There is nothing new about the storyI - CGI
There might be no other Marvel movies with that amount of CGI. The backgrounds, the suits, the weapons, everything shines and is clean. Yes some of it is not CGI, but even the practical effects and the real suits look like out of the computer. Of course this is a modern society, but i think african savannah would still leave some trace on all that fancy stuff. I generally thought this was a very ugly movie, only the mountain tribe looked interesting to me.II - Characters
Okay, they tried to give Killmonger a good backstory. That worked for me fine, but while he has this tragic story, you make him also look like the most arrogant guy in the world. He claims to fight for the innocent yet he brags about how many of them he killed in unjust wars. And Black Panther basically becomes a guy who's only motivation is to be a good king. He has however no clue how to achieve that. In one scene he wants to only act in Wakanda, in the next he basically destroys big parts of Busan. I in no second cared about him. There are so many ""cool"" side characters, that you can not focus on one of them or on the main characters. In the end i don't care about who dies and it fits that Martin Freeman does not die even though he decides to sacrifice himself, because if he would have died there would have been one character that actually lost something.III: Story
Everything in this movie has already been on screen for 100 times. A young king gets replaced by an evil family relative and decides to take the throne back with the help of some half-outlaws (that obviously refuse to fight because they could not be a Deus Ex Machina if they would not). You may love the movie, but no one can actually say that this story is innovative in any way. I was bored for most of the movie.At last two small things:
Why do they speak bad english in Wakanda even though they were never an english colony?
Why are african and afro-american culture mixed. Why do we need american rap in Africa??"
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2018,6/10,"I liked the acting, the action, the CGI. The story was a great disappointment, a mess of a composite of every comic book that came before it. Superman--check. Batman--check. Thor--check. Even throw in Mulan and Star Wars for good measure and of course the obligatory Hollywood political messages, more subtle than many recent movies, but there, like a sliver in the fun. All in all, a very unsatisfying film, and far short of my hopes and expectations."
BLACK PANTHER,20 July 2019,4/10,"Didn't quite understand what all the fuss is about, sorry"
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2018,1/10,"There is little disdain for other religions in this film, at the beginning of the duration, why is Islam always described as a criminal"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,8/10,I absolutely love this movie. There was a lot of very empowering things about in the movie. And I love the plot.
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,6/10,"I mean, it's not bad. It really is not a bad movie, a 7 is good. I just don't get why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece. It is just another MCU movie really. And the ending fight scene reminded me of the Phantom Menace? I don't know if many people agree with me on that but that's how I see it. This was also one of the first movies where I got up and left for a few minutes cause one of the jokes made me cringe too hard.Other than that, it was good, entertaining, recommended easily to anyone that has not seen it that watches the MCU films."
BLACK PANTHER,8 October 2018,10/10,"Coolness of this hero is beyond expectation,makes excited everytime you watched it"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"Okay first of all, the visual is no doubt amazing ! The acting is good. However i find the negative part is this movie story line. Nothing surprising . It is like plain jane. But overall still is a enjoyable movie and of course the marvelous visual. Well well, if there is a part 2, maybe will watch it :)"
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,6/10,I fell asleep during this movie...I normally like Michael B Jordan but his acting was terrible. Pretty sure it was because the lines they gave him were absolutely cringeworthy. Worst MCU villain I have seen. They should have kept Andy Serkis instead. His character was much more interesting and his acting was great.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,7/10,"Like all Marvel movies, good acting , good cast, good humor,.... however it had some cringe parts, like the Jabari tribe making gorilla sounds, i found that cringe and unnecessary, and Killmonger's scars which looked more like he had a skin diseasespeaking of Killmonger...terrible antagonist.. perhaps not the best cast choice either.... a great antagonist needs to be fascinating somehow either be charismatic or creepy or witty, he needs to have something that makes you wanna see more of him...... but this guy is just annoying and cringe, worst Marvel villain yet, he's also racist .... this movie is a solid 7"
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2018,2/10,"Story was woeful, drawn out and mainly unnecessary. Got sick of watching it. Gave it 2 points for CGI content alone."
BLACK PANTHER,7 October 2018,4/10,"This movie is massively over hyped. It was entertaining, that's about it. To many overused/heard situations in this movie, very predictable, just seemed like a broken record. I thought black panther was better in civil war, he was so cool, powerful, and wise. He seemed so weak and average in his own movie. Nothing special. I didn't like it."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"I was one of those that wasn't expecting too much, however, I feel this marvel film had a better storyline and better background support for its characters than any Marvel film in 2017 for sure. It wasn't perfect, however, there was a lot detail put into this film in areas where there was lacking."
BLACK PANTHER,25 December 2018,6/10,"Not nearly as good as the critics would have you believe, but then not nearly as bad as some of the reviewers here say. You might have to suspend your disbelief a bit more than usual, even for a Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2020,8/10,"Black Panther movie connects with one very quickly. The movie takes off as the president of the country is shot very early at the United Nations convention.
New leader has to be selected, and the dual that the village has to go through evolves as all the participating tribes gathers for the challenge.
The movie leaves aark as the story evolves into how the highly advance culture takes the vaccum in the leadership and fills it with challenges that comes with the day to day working."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,1/10,"Ok overall I found this film boring. I have enjoyed most of the other Marvel superhero movies like Iron Man, Captain America etc. In all honesty this was the poorest one. I thought the actors were totally unbelievable, like they were in a high school play or something. The story was drawn out and could be condensed to half the duration of the film and the story was not interesting. The only character that was half believable was the villain. Such a shame because when we got a glimpse of Black Panther in Winter Solider, I so wanted to see this film. I don't usually write reviews, but because this film has been hyped up to be a masterpiece, I felt like I had to chime in a lay waste to that claim. Even the kids in the cinema looked bored. I love many ""black"" movies, a lot of which are classics in my opinion and truly brilliant movies. This was not one of them. Blade (1997) for example urinates all over this film in every way. The pro critics have obviously felt pressured to give this rave reviews out of fear of being labelled racists by the social justice mob. I am not racist, the film is just poor."
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2018,6/10,"I saw this film in the theater and was surprised! Finally Marvel made a superhero movie with a unique score! And that's where my praise for Black Panther ends.This film is the same old Marvel scheme. With the added bonus of being ""political"" I cannot believe how highly this film has been praised. It's far from Marvel's best work and to be honest, the race aspect of it seems forced and frankly, leads no where. The film leads it up the whole movie, but falls short of breaking out of the Marvel formula. I don't understand why Marvel of all franchises attempted to make a political film. Yes, I think this film is political. Although if I were to describe this film in one word, it would be ""pretentious.""This film brings nothing new to the table, save a change of skin tone. I understand why it is successful and why people praise it. But many other films (films more artistic and/or serious than a Marvel film) have portrayed a similar, if not exact copy, of the story presented in Black Panther. I liked the soundtrack, but the film itself was a Marvel movie, and it showed. Overall, I like the film, but is not a masterpiece and in my opinion is the same caliber of film as Iron Man 2. It is thanks to this film I understand the super hero movie fatigue."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,8/10,"As someone watching Marvel's movies ever since the first Ironman, guess I have some qualification of critising the whole franchise. 
I've been disliking the direction Disney choose for Civil War and the following titles, which mostly put ""fun"" upon telling a story about ""hero"" or just making a proper movie. Black Panther surprisingly shows some difference. The whole movie is trying to be not-so-""funny"". Instead, they treat the character seriously, build the jorney and the character's arc convincingly, and made several reflection on contemporary issues. 
Surely there are ""Marvel issues"" remaining. The music repeatedly jumps from unique and interesting style back to lame and formatic orchestra. Several scenes' cinematography remain lack of contrast (but mostly good job for Rachel Morrison! much better than the disastrous Thor 3). And the dialogues are definately childish compared to the issues they try to dicuss about. But in all, this is a bright changes for Marvel's Cinematic Universe. 
Seen the Infinity War trailer, you can tell this new style is continuing (especially considering the whole trailer has no silly jokes!). Good decision this time, Disney!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,I would have liked to have seen them use more music during the action scenes
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,,"Black Panther is the most recent Marvel flick, it tells the story of T¬¥Challa the king of the fictional country of Wakanda and his battle with Erik Killmonger who also wants to claim the title of king.This movie tries to make something different on the superhero genre and to have something relevant to say.It deals with themes about family, racism, prejudice and the search for identity.It is one of the best superhero movies out there, it has a dfferent vibe in its approach thanks to the african culture represented during the whole movie in the mitology, the costumes, the figurine, production design, soundtrack, etc.
The script is good, the cast is great and the main character and villain are well defined, the motives that made Killmonger became the villain made sense and were credible.The battle sequences were also good and well choreographed.The cinematography is stunning, the mix between technology and nature makes for a unique look also in the interior sets.
The CGI in this movies is great as always, however there were some moments were it could have been better and the green screen was noticeable, and the script although is good it¬¥s a little confuse in the beginning and predictable in a moment.
Black Panther ends up being a great superhero movie and another great offering by Marvel Studios.8.1/10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"The title put is not to bring any form of offense to African-Americans/ Africans since while watching the movie, I never felt about the racial element in the movie, that people keep pin-pointing, but the overall performance by all the actors in the movie. This is another amazing piece from Marvel universe with Black Panther making an impact in the class of superhero movies. The background story is amazing and so was the action till the very end. The part before interval flows slow but picks from the first action sequence on-wards. I observed that all the actors which not only the lead actors but also the supporting roles & extras really jumped in to make a Marvel Movie. Good job by the director Ryan Coogler to craft a wonderful movie that not only consists of just action sequence, but message about the African tribe how much significance they emphasize on vibranium and safeguarding it from evil purposes. Boseman and Jordan were exceptional in their roles as well. This is a good flick from Marvel that you would love watching at least once."
BLACK PANTHER,25 May 2018,6/10,"Black Panther had great themes of brotherhood, family and diplomacy. Killmonger seemed like a flat character. His expression hardly changed when he does something and barely broke a sweat either. Seeing his fight with T'Challa was okay, the movements were fast but where's the technique? It was a fight between family so it felt sad rather than epic since Killmonger did have a royal right but he was more of an extremist.T'Challa was a nicely developed character with internal conflicts between tradition and diplomacy for the preservation of his country versus personal feelings towards helping individuals. But the strange purple spirit world made it hard to watch and lessened the depth of emotions. Shuri had a funny personality with great character support such as the interesting scene with the car. While it was good to see Agent Ross participating, it almost seemed like his character is just along for the ride but it was amazing he risked his life and is willing to work with others. However, it seemed like his personality changed in the second half of the movie like he was quieter and reserved but maybe it's due to the shock of being in a high tech environment with hidden vibranium.This movie reflects on several themes on deeper levels but the action, comedy and visual scenes does not make this movie very entertaining because it's not light-hearted but rather a real thinker!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,3/10,"""Black Panther"" is the first Big Budget and Ensemble Cast Black Superhero/Comic Movie made in history. Despite all that was put into the production of this film, all audiences get is yet another Typical, Very Generic, and Over the top Cliched Superhero/Comic movie that has been shown and told hundreds of times before.Despite the movie's extreme lack of originality, there is some entertainment to enjoy here. The World of the movie is not only good looking and interesting but very Sophisticated, the most ever seen in the Superhero film genre. There is a lot of ""Eye-Candy"" to see throughout the movie but it cannot cover up the lack of storytelling and ""Amateurish"" acting from a good cast of acting talent. From Costume design, to certain set pieces, make-up, etc. are well done, but are often ruined and spoiled due to Poor and Weak Visual effects work. If your expecting a Great Visual Effect Superhero Movie Spectacle prepare to be disappointed here. The CGI is very noticeable and often times characters and objects look like Cartoons. In addition, the choreography in the action and fight scenes are slow and obvious, looking like actors in Theater Rehearsals waiting for their cues. Furthermore, The performances are good, Chadwick Boseman and Letitia Wright stand out the most overall, including the acting chemistry between the two of them. The weakest and worst of the bunch are Micheal B. Jordan and Martin Freeman as both their characters were not only generic, but extremely Dull. Martin Freeman's ""Everett K. Ross"" was meaningless, had no real purpose to be involved in the narrative at all, and add Michael B. Jordan's ""Killmonger"" to the List of Forgettable Villains, which has become a consistent trend in Marvel Studio movies over the recent years. Others such as Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis's characters perform well with what they were working with, but both have limited screen time to help really benefit the film's narrative at all. Finally, ""Black Panther"" is a Comic/Superhero movie that stays true to it's guns from beginning to end. It doesn't deviate from it's tone and story arc unlock most Marvel Studios movies always do. On a personal note, it's good to finally get another Marvel Studios movie that focuses on it's Title Character instead of a Superhero movie that follows multiple characters and story arcs at the same time that are pointless with no meaning to the Main Title's Protagonist. Overall, ""Black Panther"" may be another forgettable Superhero Movie, but it is a decent addition to the Comic Book Superhero Genre, including to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,9/10,"Background.
Director and co-writer, Ryan Coogler embarks onto the great journey of a King's rise to the throne with Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) returning once again as T'Challa of Wakanda, his challenger, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) as Erik Killmonger, as well as other great stars such as Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) in this Marvel Studio adventure.Highlight!
As any origin story, the film illustrates the growth of the individual but, in doing so, carves its own path with grand ideas such as the fulfillment of legacy and the deprivation of heritage.Remarkable? 
In this Marvel outing, I'd argue that the setting is just as important as the characters in the film. Though a setting in actuality, as a character, Wakanda brings an influence, enriched with a technology meets tradition aesthetic which can play into T'Challa's involvement in the MCU or at the very least in Black Panther films going forward.Here's to fighting and overcoming all forms of strife that cannot keep strong voices in the shadow! Always a war..."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,10/10,"It was a great film. Will definately watch again. The story was unexpexted, immersive and humorous too. It is a must watch and most definately is not overrated"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"FINALLY! A movie that celebrates African heritage and contributions, and doesn't look down on all the beautiful art, culture, music and everything else this fine continent has produced. Everything about this movie was phenomenal. The special effects were obviously mind blowing, but the acting was the absolute best part. I never saw a comic book movie with this much powerhouse performances. They all did so good, I will see this movie again and again. I can't wait for sequels! Also so proud of Ryan Coogler for breaking all the stereotypes and painting the most gorgeous picture of African life, and everything it can be. Such a riveting story from start to end. LOVEDDDDDD"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Really overrated movie, not sure what the hype is about. What makes the ""critics"" experts in the field of movie reviews and why do they think they are always right and every other opinion is wrong? I give it 1 star because there are better superhero movies out there and lately there has been too many of them to count. I think audience is over-saturated with superhero movies, that nobody cares anymore."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,1/10,"Wow, what a piece of garbage! I rejected watching this movie since it was released in the theatre mainly because I didn't see the appeal.I really didn't know anything about the Black Panther character and eventually decided I would give it a chance. Mainly because I read countless positive reviews, it was a smash success at the box office and then got an Oscar nomination for best picture (well that and the fact that there was nothing on Netflix that appealed to me) . Ok...I figured I have to see what this movie is all about. I couldn't even get through an hour of this film. How could it possibly gross over 1.1 billion dollars!? I'm absolutely dumbfounded that this train wreck of a movie surpassed it's $200+ million dollar production budget in the first place. This is the first Marvel movie that I can truly say I hated.The movie itself is dull, the storyline is ridiculous, non-stop CGI.....I fast forwarded to the end of the movie to see what it was all building up to.....A whole lot of nothing. Marvel movies were almost always guaranteed to be a hit. I personally have found that since the original Avengers came out, the writers/production teams have been taking shortcuts. The Marvel machine already has a dedicated army of fans that support anything they make so they throw out the ""quality"" in lieu of ""quantity"", it's extremely disappointing when good things reverse their priorities like this. An empire should be built with masterpiece after masterpiece otherwise it will eventually fall....you can only churn out garbage like this movie for so long before fizzling out.Please, don't waste your time watching this."
BLACK PANTHER,2 October 2018,8/10,And with good reason! the film was awesome. Casting and direction were on point. The soundtrack...it's still ringing in my ears. WATCH THIS FILM! One of the best of 2018
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,2/10,"I will preface this by saying, I am not a Marvel fan, nor is this my genre. Due to all the hype and positive press, I went to see the movie. While the acting and sets were superb, I found the plot itself was a let down. From a sociological perspective, I felt it promoted vigilante justice, might makes right, and ""stick with your own kind"" thinking. These are tired cliches. Further, it doesn't elevate Black Americans to play into the old plot lines, especially when the violence is brother vs brother. The climax literally has a main character self destruct rather than live in bondage. The message made me very uncomfortable."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2018,10/10,"Run, don't walk, to the theater to see Black Panther. This is not hyperbole. It's just that good. Heck, saying it's just ""good"" is underselling it."
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,5/10,"I had really high expectations for this one after Civil War. Watched the midnight premier and disliked it. (Weak plot, mediocre acting, few memorable scenes). A week later I was surprised when this movie appeared as one of Marvel's top ten movies. For me is as weak as the first Thor installments."
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,1/10,"I really hate this movie, not only because it is bad, and because it is such if a waste of potential. The main reason I saw this movie is becuase of civil war, thy give character into black panthers more than his own movie. In civil war, the conflict between captain America and black panthers are pretty interesting, you totally understand why he wants to kill winter soilder, and that gives the character motive. But in this movie, it's just stupid. You gain power from flowers, why don't you give it to your people, even just some of your finest worriers, but it doesn't matter. The whole movie is boring, the only good part is the car chase, but the rest, headache for two hour. We really don't see the stugle of black cat man, he wants to be a good king, but he is doing pretty good, everyone loves him, when he is being questioned by this golden cat man, black cat man is not in the wrong at all, then what makes this gold cat man think it's ok to rule this kingdom, it is his dad who fked up! The clash between two cat man is really weak, they are just fighting, there is not much reason behind it. And VFX is horrible. They could've make a great movie out of it, he is a god damn king, it's hard, all I can see he only know how to punch people, and he is going to rule this kingdom with crazy technology, it is hard, but he just do it like it is nothing! Fk this movie I hated it."
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,10/10,It feels as if i've seen this movie 10000 times and i still cant get enough of it.
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,2/10,"Stopped watching after an hour, I just kept hoping it would get better or start actually making some kind of sense. I can buy the fact that ""vibranium"" is a real element. But the Panther gets his power from some kind of magic potion, which is also able to take his power away. So what is the point of having vibranium? Every character from Wakanda was able to fly or perform ""superhero"" type abilities. I was so confused!! No explanations for anything, you just watch people doing things (such as flying) with no explanation of how they do it. If you are the type of superhero fan that can buy into Superman flying, or Batman or Iron Man having millions of dollars to devote to R&D, or the Incredible Hulk or Spiderman being radioactive, well, this is totally different. Those other movies at least have some kind of scientific explanation, even if some of the science isn't proven yet. There is no science here, no depth of characters, no one to actually ""root"" for. And of course, because it was a ""black superhero movie"", they had to base the movie in Africa. So cliched and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Sure there are worse movies, but right now I can't think of one."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2019,9/10,This movie is amazing! I liked kilmonger and he is tied with thanos as the best marvel villain. Him speaking about black people being oppressed is so true. I can't wait for the sequel!
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2019,7/10,"This movie have some things that most MCU films don't have (excelent villain, Makes you think), but it make mistakes that Marvel Movies don't usually do (Bad CGI, bad Third Act, mediocre Main Character)"
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2019,1/10,This Movie Was So Garbage it wasn't Even Funny Or Cool after waiting 6 years for this movie to come out I wouldn't expect it to be this trash ü§¢
BLACK PANTHER,3 February 2019,1/10,I heard that this movie is Oscar nominated so I was very excited to watch this movie but after watching the movie I was totally disappointed.This movie has no Oscar material.And it doesn't deserve this rating.If there was any option of negative rating I would have given it negative rating.
BLACK PANTHER,15 January 2020,10/10,"Reading the negative reviews make me angry - it's as if people are upset that this movie has a higher message. Which it does, AND while being entertaining. There's not a joke every other line like in Thor Ragnarok but rather an appropriate amount of humor. There's a great villain with a compelling storyline. There's a solid plot that makes for a great movie separate from the Marvel universe. And yes, it makes you think."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2019,4/10,No story other than wakanda is with equipped technology.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2019,,"I tried SOOO hard to like this. Four times I tried to get into it but couldn't even go a half hour without thinking ""this is just so silly.""
I must be in the minority since everyone else seems to love it."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,7/10,"I was very excited when this movie was announced. The ratings were over the top, so I had higher expectations than I usually have.Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I hate to say it, because I am a very fond Marvel fan and I've seen every Marvel movie over a dozen times, but this one will not be one of those. I am also glad I didn't have to pay for it, because I was invited. That says a lot.The plot was dull. I didn't get what Killmonger wanted to achieve and why. First it looked like revenge because his father was killed by T'Chaka, then it was disappointment that Wakanda kept all the power for itself and didn't help others - outside Wakanda - to fight oppression. He wasn't very impressive as villain as well. Maybe he should have had more screen time?In Civil War Chadwick Boseman excelled as king and BP but in this movie he wasn't very convincing as weren't the other actors.I thought to see more of the African and Wakanda's culture and high-tech. There was only Shuri who was outstanding but wasn't portrayed very well either. All was done so fast, nobody has been shown more than a few snippets at a time. It was a come and go of characters but there was no conviction, no suspense.I'm sad that the first Marvel movie that was made with nearly all black people, was so poorly made. It would have deserved so much better.It nearly breaks my heart to say it, but it's not worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2019,1/10,"I don't get it. Just because this is a movie featuring 99% black actors, and we want to celebrate that, that doesn't mean that we have to pretend it is good!The movie is horrible! The CGI looks like taken from a 2015 video game. The train scene at the end looks so bad..The dialogue is the worst I have seen recently in movies. '' You can do it brotha!'' ''You like that?'' and all those gems of catchphrases make this so ridiculous, I honestly can't believe the Oscar nomination. It is 100% based on political bias and has nothing to do with the quality (which I am still searching for) of the movie.By far the worst Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2019,7/10,"The MCU has made some films I would describe as truly fantastic, such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man 3. Black Panther by contrast was an fun movie, not a masterful piece or arts, but a mostly fun movie. Killmonger is one of the superior villains in the MCU because of the well fleshed out nature of his characters, properly established motivations, and a kick ass and sympathetic performance from Michael B Jordan. The protagonist however is simply a dull character who you simply aren't invested in, simply because of the high benchmark set forth by the MCU pertaining to protagonists.
The movie does NOT have a deep message, infact like Captain America: Civil War It masquerades itself as a deep movie by creating a moral dilemma, and then executing it in the most generic and unintriguing way possible. If you come to find enjoyment in Black panther through substance you will be disappointed. If you come for fun action sequences, some nicely done drama, and an enjoyable cinematic experience, Black Panther certainly delivers. The movie uses the facade of culture to pretend like it's not part of Kevin Feiges manufacturing line of same old variations of cinema, but ultimately the shoot em up third act pretty much exposes the fact that black panther is another fun, somewhat funny, display of popcorn entertainment from marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"I almost love the film, The Black Panther. It's visuals are stunning, the CGI is wonderful, the cinematography is sumptuous, and the acting is really good...and then there's Michael B. Jordan. 
To say I was disappointed with his acting is a vast understatement. I get that he's supposed to be angry, vindictive, etc. But Jordan's interpretation of his character was like watching some bad '70's black revenge flick. It was all about being from the hood, and the whole 'we're an oppressed people' attitude that really sinks Jordan's acting and the reasoning for his taking the throne. 
For a character who is supposed to be so educated, so highly trained, he only came across as an angry man who is only out for revenge. Add in the ridiculous and incongruous fact that, despite all his anger throughout the film, he suddenly reverts to a contemplative man who says he always wanted to see the beautiful Wakandan sunsets his dad had spoken of years previously as he sat dying near the films' conclusion.
Such a change in a character is either terrible acting, bad scriptwriting, bad directing or editing, or a combination of all three. Jordan is a decent actor, but his performance in the Black Panther is just terrible and completely detracts from the film as a whole. Too bad. This movie could have been spectacular."
BLACK PANTHER,22 August 2020,1/10,MSM practically competed to be the most hysterical in overly praising this utter drivel. Please go to youtube to check out the 'critical drinker' review - it's far more entertaining than the uber woke movie itself.
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2019,1/10,"Wow. Utter rubbish. This is like something A Dolphin from Germany would have dreamt up. So Wakanda is soooooooo good they choose to leave the rest of the world in the dark with their new found gains? They could help everyone and don't? They are so against all others they build walls, hide and are nationalist? Wow, just wow! Every crettin crittic that give this a 10 hates the world and it's beautifull people."
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2019,1/10,"Rubbish. The Wakandans hide all their ill gotten gains fron the rest of the world and hate their impoverished neighbours and all others worldwide. This is a movie of pure hate. No love of purity in it. Only violence. Dissapointed.Half computer game CGI, half horrible. If you have kids, do not let then see this mess."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2020,7/10,"The villain's motives are credible. He watched his father's death, bore the heavy history of black Americans, imagined the advanced wealth of his father's hometown, hated their inaction, and grew into an extremist. What he believed and came into contact with was might isright. It is the political intervention in other countries under the power and the discrimination and oppression of the non-ethnic group. In his eyes, whoever has a hard fist can be the boss. Who's the hardest fist? It's something he's never seen before, his father's hometown, Wakanda. So with hate, madness and ambition, he forcibly knocked on the closed Wakanda.
What Panther faces is where Wakanda should go. Dazzling technology, rich countries, top-notch armed forces, all these desirable forces, if only safe-corner, what is there.? Meaning? With this power, should we bear the responsibility at the same time?
Two people, for their own ideal society, face each other and life and death.
The film is bright in color and beautiful in design. All the female characters are great."
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2020,2/10,This is awful. Not recommended at all. Why would they do this?
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,1/10,"Title says it all. 
No I'm not a racist.
Film was flawed in almost every regard.
Best (only) good thing in it was Michael B Jordan. Only he felt 'real'. Everyone else was cardboard. Story was boring. Plot was contrived. So much fakeness (even for MCU) it was hard not to just roll your eyes, shake your head and fall asleep.
SJW's over hyping this did no service to anyone.
Nothing more to say."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2021,8/10,"A lot of people hate this movie, I would give it a 8 decent plot, great act, sometimes boring, but overall you can go and watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2021,2/10,"Bad acting, bad editing, a lousy score. Contradictions in the storyline. Some of the worst I¬¥ve seen in years."
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2021,8/10,"This movie is about a rich hero who is born in Africa in a city with very hi-tech machines that no one knows about. His father dies from an explosion planted by a Winter Soldier. The hero then tries to avenge his father's death and kill the Winter Soldier, but in the meantime, his brother tries to kill the hero and take his title of King.I like this film because it is a mixture of action and humour with a good plot. The actors in this film bring it to life and are very good at their jobs.Review by Valters, Latvia."
BLACK PANTHER,19 October 2019,7/10,"Charismatic actors, some creative decoration and a bit of novelty & kitsch in the pitch save this movie which otherwise has no scenario, no psychological depth and a lot of boring action. Watch only out of intellectual curiosity."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,,"I don't care what anyone else says, your opinion is your opinion but this movie was fantastic. Marvel did a fantastic job at this movie. I can't take anything from Marvel comics who are topping DC by a long shot. I love how they kept the African Element but also did it in a modernized way that people can relate and connect to this movie. This movie was a perfect setup to lead to the next Avengers movie."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,2/10,"If you like a movie with no real characters, full of stereotypes from the boring 90s movies, a dull plot full of cliches, a very uninteresting story told in a most boring way, kindergarden level acting, then look no further. I won't bother going into details. There are already many long and detailed reviews out there explaining why and how everything about this movie sucks big time.I thought Ant-Man (speaking of which has an imdb rating of 7.3-?!?!) to be the worst movie in Marvel Universe but they managed to prove me wrong and outdo themselves. Kudos Marvel dudes. I give 2 stars for the sake of the CGI guys who apparently spent the most time and effort for this movie.Last note goes to IMDB ratings. Marvel recently is not only successful in creating movies almost as bad as DC, but also in destroying IMDB ratings' credibility. 7+??? Guy Ritchie's King Arthur has 6.8, which also is overrated, is much more of a movie compared to this piece of junk.Thank you for inspiring me to write my first ever review."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,7/10,"Those who rated the film between 1-4 were obviously not a big superheroes movie fan. For me it's only the acting problem that quite unnatural for few actors. The rests were covered by the fancy gadgets and beauty of wakanda. Come on, this is only a movie .. what do you expect ? And take note that the movie is merely comic based not a novel based. Sorry for my poor english .. wakanda forever"
BLACK PANTHER,13 November 2020,10/10,"Loved it from begining to spectacular end. I felt compelled to counter all the surprisingly negative reviews to what I felt was an amazingly portrayed piece of cinema.
First of all Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa (& IRL) was everything. His charm & charisma set the tone for the world that is Wakanda (forever X). The colorful cinematography & wardrobe was top notch. While not a devout Marvel fan I think the film stood on its own with enough backstory for hardcore comic fans.
The action scenes were thrilling especially anytime the Dora Milaje & their fearless leader occupied the screen.. Of course Black Panther & Killmonger were good also (too much green screen for my taste).
I enjoyed the supporting characters, imagery & storyline.
Defiantly more relatable to me than any other comic book movie, it felt real, empowering & refreshingly new. A must see in my opinion and according to box office sales a whole lot of others too."
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,4/10,I have just watched The Black Panther movie I do agree that it is slightly overated the acting was good and the fight scenes were good but I thought that some parts of the movie were slow and took too long to get going other than that the movie I thought was good.
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,"As you might of noticed from anyone not being a 15 year old kid reviewing movies this movie was bad, utterly bad.The acting was wooden and the accent annoyed me after a while (trying too hard), I've heard African people speak the English language in a much more pleasant way.The CGI is the main hero of the story here, as you will notice that's where Marvel likes to spend their money. They did it again, just make the movie good enough for them to earn enough to make another pile of dung. (Unfortunately this recipe works well for them)I must admit I liked the jokes in Deadpool but Marvel is just floating along in a sea of mediocreness and no port in sight."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2019,5/10,"Entirely over hyped. I felt no emotion towards any character, good or bad. It served no purpose towards the greater scheme of things. A dull origin story that merely set a location for the final fight in Infinity War. I can't figure out what role he will fill when the next phase takes off. Politically charged, nonsensical plot to appease racebaters. Not the worst movie ever, but I was rather disappointed in the result."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2018,1/10,"So much fuss, about the black liberation movement, one would expect this movie to be a little bit political. But, alas!I would pay to unsee this movie"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"What's with all the Panther bashing?A wide mix of user reviews is fine and perfectly normal for a big budget blockbuster, but 1 and 2 star reviews for an extremely accomplished popcorn flick is unacceptable.
I am not usually one to defend the critics (for me, their recent cynical critique of The Greatest Showman completely missed the point of the movie), but they generally have Black Panther spot on, at a time when Hollywood is finally starting to face some of it's demons.Let's deal with the big black elephant in the room first...
I felt very uncomfortable recently when I heard a local radio DJ recommend the movie ""...that stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis"".
Basically the only two white actors in a movie which is quite deliberately (and justifiably) NOT white.
It's a black superhero movie - big deal right?
Most of the cast and crew are black - that actually IS a big deal, and has some pretty major relevance too if you've followed the news even slightly over the past few years.
That fact alone though is probably a good reason to sign a petition or turn up to a rally but not necessarily a reason to go to the cinema. So let's move on.The action is great fun without being too excessive. The vast majority of characters are well fleshed out compared to the usual 'making up the numbers or two many cooks' in these films. And it has just the right amount of heart and mind without diluting the genre. I thought it also just managed to be different enough from the other MCU flicks to have it's own identity. Which is an achievement in itself at a time when they're churning out three of these babies a year.For what it's worth, I really enjoyed it and so did my kids.Sure, there's some overlong sequences, poorly delivered lines and the odd dodgy special effect, but that criticism can be levelled at ninety percent of the multiplex movies nowadays.Personally I was very happy to see a big budget, mainstream film that gave significance to more than just one or two non-white characters. BUT MORE THAN THAT, I was proud to take my young (white) daughter to a family film that featured a range of strong women who did much more than just spend the duration pouting, bitching or trying to make love to the camera.So if you don't like minor elements of social, political or topical discussion in your blockbuster I suggest you stick to Michael Bay films. If you don't like the way different movie directors are putting their own stamp on your beloved comics, stick to the comics.I've only seen it once, but I'm still trying to decide if Black Panther might topple Civil War as my favourite Marvel movie so far.Like it? Great. Don't like it? No problem.
But the 1 and 2 star reviewers can go suck balls, watch the Emoji Movie, and stop insulting most people's intelligence.I give it a solid 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,9/10,"I don't write many reviews, but a lot of the reviews I saw on here for this movie seemed to have an agenda so I decided to share a review that has none.I went in having heard nothing but good things about the movie, and left having thoroughly enjoyed it. The action was solid, exciting. The plot was fairly standard, but had some moments I did not expect, though nothing revolutionary. The villain was strong, compelling and most importantly threatening. The costumes were a wonderful mix of traditional and tribal African clothes blended seamlessly with modern western clothes. They were bright and colorful, and just generally visually appealing. The same goes for Wakanda itself. Michael B. Jordan and Sterling K. Brown both delivered fantastic performances and I can see why Brown has been winning so many awards.There were some parts that sort of dragged, but really that was my biggest complaint. Overall it was exciting and fun, with some wonderful comedic moments.I think the message of the film, that we are stronger and better together than we are apart, is timeless. But perhaps applicable now more than ever."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,10/10,"I'm scrolling through lots of 1 star reviews, people calling this movie flat and boring?! Are you effin kidding me? Is this what the Alt White ""man movement"" is up to now? Just trolling Black Panther on IMDb? To quote that fake orange person ""in charge"": SAD! Anyone who is a normal human being who ACTUALLY WATCHED this movie knows that it ROCKED! That's all I'm gonna say. No spoilers, but an honest human person loving this movie. It was beautiful in all the details, all the characters. T'Challa has the most delicious voice, his sister and all the other women in this movie were AWESOME."
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2018,7/10,"Reason for the rating is for origin of black panther only, overall the whole movie kind of lacked action which I love about marvel movies. This movie is very much like the 'Iron Man 2' so if you loved that movie please go ahead and watch the movie, do not be concerned with my reviews. 
Me , as an initial viewer of Marvel movies, did not like the IM2 movie as it lacked the action and a good story. Though, people argue that story of both movies (IM2, BP) were great and some even went on great lengths to praise it (BP) as best for some race.
But, for me this is all gimmick whatever fashion and issues are trending gets used by big companies to paddle money and common people get conned. 
(*** I did not want to get philosophical and 'conspiracy theory' about a movie which is not even a great movie anyway, but when i expressed my views some people pis**d me off so I though why not.)Last words, overall an average, fun movie and do not expect to get a **epiphany** while watching."
BLACK PANTHER,3 June 2018,7/10,"I liked that movie, actors and acting was good. Lupita and Letitia were cute ones."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther ReviewAll performances were fantastic. Standouts: Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, and Angela BassettFilm was paced very well, some slow bouts, but performances keep you engaged the whole way throughGreat action sequences, the King Challenges were particularly exciting, however a tad predictable. But the predictability of these sequences, even the final fight, don't suffer too much because the performances and the action are very engaging.Personally felt the CGI was solid. Wasn't spectacular as they've been before in Marvel, but they were still good and weren't glaringly bad. I never groaned or felt disappointed with them once.Best villain Marvel has had to date. Killmonger was strong, smart, and exciting. He's also very sympathetic. My only quarrel with his storyline is that he had to die. I would've loved him potentially working with Wakanda in bringing help to those in need, especially since that's what T'Challa decides to do in the end. But his death scene and final line were powerful.The soundtrack and original score were exceptional. The use of the Black Panther hip-hop album was great. As well as the bass & high hat infusions with the orchestra through the original score.The blend of traditional, older African culture and modern society/technology was gripping. I adored the sets and costumes. They were colorful and unique. I wish I got to see more of the everyday life and culture of the people of Wakanda, it would've been great to see especially since a mini Civil War/Revolution takes place. To see how it affected the everyday people would've went a long way.It truly stands on its own in the MCU. It has its ties, but the film is strongly independent which makes it all the more better."
BLACK PANTHER,13 August 2018,10/10,"A movie that shows a majority black cast as more than slaves and thugs. Good storyline, great acting! I've been on this planet for 30yrs and feel like ""finally, a black movie that I can show my daughter and nephews that doesn't include a white master or the abuse of a black female"" I can't imagine how a black person born in the 40s/50s/60s/70s felt watching this."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is such a fun time for Marvel fans. Even for fans who don't watch Marvel's movies consistently, this movie delivers. There are some events that conclude in this movie that took place in Captain America: Civil War (2016), but the film summarizes everything so no audience member is confused. Michael B Jordan is phenomenal as Erik Kilmonger, he is (in my opinion), one of the best Marvel villains in a while. The girls around him (Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright), all do an amazing job not only to elevate T'Challa, but themselves as well. The movie just delivers in all cylinders, great film."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,"It's really bad. Boring and hideous story, nothing really enjoyable, not even the hero himself.A superhero movie that looks like a weird mashup between Coming to America and Stargate. 
With Kendrick Lamar songs. 
And definitely not funny."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,6/10,"Definitively not a bad movie, but I kinda expected more. It's just... very predictable. I kinda liked the ""bad guy"" because you can relate to him to a certain degree (not all the way of course), but the end kinda sucked. I got some Starwars Ep I vibes during the end battle, which is not exactly a good point."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,1/10,"Maybe one of the worst films I've ever seen. An absolute disaster of terrible acting, extremely thin story and super shallow dialogues, and if there was a director, he is unnoticeable. I have no idea how some people ravish praises on a horrible film."
BLACK PANTHER,30 June 2018,1/10,"Absolutely shallow, the worst acting in a film since ""Showgirl""..bad, so so bad."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2020,1/10,"Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar?
It's not even the best Marvel movie.
I couldn't believe how overrated it was.
It appears that ""tokenism"" is now alive in the Oscars."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"A lot of the low reviews on here miss the mark on what the film was about. It wasn't just a superhero vs the bad guy. It was about a difficult family secret, that changed the dynamics of the storyline. It touched on difficult subjects, and brought to light things that were usually kept in the dark. You will see amazing visual effects, and stunning outfits, including phenomenal performances by the actors and actresses of the film. Black Panther just proving that Marvel Studios and the MCU is only getting better even after ten years. This is a movie to see!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"I got a ticket to an advanced screening tonight. I watch all the superhero movies and usually they are predictable to me, however Black Panther had ""several"" plot twists that I didn't see coming. Graphics were excellent! Can't say I really noticed the music. Also some good Laugh Out Loud moments-phrases-jokes. I would give this a solid 9 out of 10. Very happy I will be seeing it twice more between now and Sunday"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,7/10,"Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of Marvel movies. Most times to me they are hit or miss, they can be well made and entertaining (Guardians of The Galaxy/Iron Man) or completely shallow and boring with a terrible plot and poor dialogue (The Avengers). When comparing Black Panther to other Marvel Films it is an amazing movie and easily in my top 5 for Marvel, but when judging it as a stand alone film I'd say it's a good, but not great movie. The plot was engaging, the visuals were pleasing and it was well acted (over all). I would say it was about 20 min too long and felt like some scenes dragged on forever. My final take away would be that it is a well made, entertaining film that was slightly too long... it was one of the 1st if not 1st Major Blockbuster with a majority Black cast and crew which will make it a historic film. Whether or not it will be a classic film only time will tell, but like most Marvel films I'm guessing it will not."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,7/10,"For a marvel movie.
Wonder Woman this is not. Nor is it as funny as Thor.
It is utterly sad how pathetically political it has become. Yes I am soooo triggered, you SJWs! 
But, aside from all the insanity around it, like rotten tomatoes deleting critical reviews, it has a brilliant plot, almost. Yes, it drags in places, yes it has some racist comments in it, no it doesn't match up to the best, and yes, it's just a dumb superhero movie, with wtf moments, but there are some really cool things that make you forget how limited it is. Kick ass female characters, an excellent villain, fabulous costumes. 
I defy anyone to remember more than one or two lines of dialogue or really be moved by it genuinely. It's a solid flick. Better than something like Transformers, not as good as something like Tomb Raider or Thor."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Its not often a movie lives up to its hype. Black Panther does. It may even exceed its hype. It certainly surpassed my expectations.For anyone complaining about the movies ""politics"" - How do you tell a story about a king and not have politics enter into it? There are three possibilities. 1) The complainers have never seen another Marvel Movie. 2) They aren't perceptive enough to recognize politics in most movies or 3) their racism is showing.This was the best superhero movie I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. It had an origin story with roots that run deep into a rich mythology. It wove in a contemporary and relevant theme and the players, hero and villain alike were human in the best and worst ways.The writing was solid and thoughtful. Superhero movies so often fall to employing A deus ex machina in the end or otherwise insult the audiences' intelligence. Black Panther did neither. It told a solid story with good action and left you with a sense of hope in the end. Thoroughly enjoyable. I hope to see it in the theater again. I will definitely add it to my collection."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,"Marvel... Thank you yet again for another fantastic addition to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Black Panther is a beautifully done super hero movie that's different from the rest. And different has the potential to be a good thing and that's what transpired here with this film. Ryan Coogler (Director) gives viewers the perfect feel and vibe of the culture and atmosphere of Wakanda to quickly engage us. All that combined with the terrific acting all across the cast and the brilliant action sequences, good plot and raw emotion all go together perfectly as we dive deep into the beautiful world of Wakanda. i plan on seeing this movie again, one of the best movies Marvel has to offer"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"The ride horses.Africans don't have tanks they ride rhinos.I found the attempts to ""Africanize"" Black Panther patronizing: rhino tanks, spear rifles, clothing, both civilian and military and body piercings that are more old National Geographic than modern Africa.I got past that nonsense and found a somewhat enjoyable and somewhat great movie - a 7; I'll watch it again, someday, on Netflix."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Easily one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen. It had multi-dimensional characters and emotional depth, some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, amazing visuals and soundtrack, and was well-acted. Chadwick Boseman's character had a heart of gold. I particularly liked that this one had a villian you could understand, compared to generic bad guys who just want to destroy the world for no reason.Probably the best Marvel movie yet."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,5/10,"Good movie but not a great movie and a rating of 5 suits best for Black Panther. The Critics were more politically biased on this one. All movies trying to adapt to the PC culture actually hurts the creativity and movie experience. Most people thinks this is the ""Marvel"" movie but i find it difficult to agree with them. There are really creative and great Marvel movies than Black Panther. Overall, it's a good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,1/10,"1. No hotties, at all, sorry, no insult intended.
2. A hidden ""most advanced city in the world is all black"", is no more believable than that God-awful Flash superhero, neither is believable, too goofy. It would be believable if there was an explanation other then: ""they had lots of a special metal"", so? You need NERD POWER and a huge population and resources, it can't be a tiny city or country.
3. Boring man, boring. Too bland, or too pretentious, it was like a long car commercial.
5. The hell was going on? Everything was dark pardon the pun, lots of action scenes were so dark and couldn't tell what happened. This was no well shot batman movie that handled dark scenes properly. Disgustingly boring."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,3/10,"In a nutshell... Waited 2 hours or so just to watch the cut scenes.To elaborate, this movie lacked a decent storyline, instead it was rather dull. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland. Wait for this movie on netflix or something. I gave this movie 3 stars because Andy Serkis was funny"
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,8/10,"Yes the movie has some issues. Accents and languages and a few characters deserve some fleshing out, but a lot of the confusion about the plot comes from lack of knowledge.And normally I would never write a review but I feel there are either so many very young people of color and non-people of color that miss the plot, simply because they are not part of the culture they are viewing on screen. The movie's core was a long standing unspoken discomfort (putting it lightly) between American black people and Africans. This movie took some of those discomforts and pain and put it front and center. Those of us who have seen and understand that very convoluted ""thing"" understand what we were seeing. It's essentially the parent (Wakandans or Africans)that left the child (Killmonger or black Americans), the child was abused, left to fend for themselves, and then the child growing to see that not only did the parent leave them, but the parent was happy, comfortable and did not care about all the evil that had befallen them.And on the other side is the parent who had no idea, what happened, but assumed from what they had seen from afar, the child had every opportunity and decided to just not take them. The child instead decided to be a menace. Therefore the parent has a negative view of that child and really doesn't want to be associated with them in any way.What happens when they meet up? T'Challa and Killmonger in the throne room.Hate it if you must, but this storyline has never been on screen before. This painful under current has never been publicly mentioned. And I can see why it could confuse. But people of color, both Africans and black people, got it..and it's started a wonderful discussion. If any of you are confused and care to learn, a quick spin around YouTube to look at videos on what Africans think of black Americans, would start to give you some insight. If not, then oh well...you're going to be confused about a lot of non Anglo movies in coming years."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"Reviewed it on Rotten Tomatoes but, strangely, it doesn't show up there...so here I am.Spoilers ahead!I thought I'd write this review having just gotten home from seeing the movie so it would be fresh in my mind. Overall, it's on par with all the other origin stories we've seen thus far and gives us a greater insight into T'Challa and how he's come to be who he is. So as Tony Stark was the billionaire playboy that had to see his life's work used to harm others and be a victim of the same before he comes around, we see T'Challa has led a life in which he was groomed from childhood to eventually rule his nation with self-sacrifice always being a possibility. Now, let's be blunt here. Given all of the absolutely asinine nonsense that was swirling about before the movie came out, the real concern was how the issues of an ethnostate and nationalism would play out on the big screen, especially because we're aware of some of the personal beliefs held by Disney execs, directors and the like. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were dealt with rather fairly and honestly. Maybe someone was watching how Star Wars: The Last Jedi was being handled and took notes on how NOT to destroy a good story by poisoning it with their personal views. That being said, they didn't go too far in the opposite direction and completely ignore that there are people in THIS world that have radical views, though they could have gone just a little further in the explanation of why they were wrong. Case in point, Killmonger openly states that other black people around the globe suffer and lays the blame squarely on the shoulders of those he doesn't speak of directly(that I can recall) i.e. white people. Anyone that knows even a smattering of history will understand that there have been black people that suffered at the hands of whites...but also at the hands of other blacks that sold their countryman into slavery themselves(unpleasant fact that not all slavers were simply grabbed and whisked away), poor decisions and even the simple lack of resources in their surroundings in which to take advantage of to better themselves. Though T'Challa disagrees with Warmonger's actions to take the world over with Wakanda(and presumably, based on his actions and speech, blacks around the world having a privileged position) being the ruling nation above all, the message that he was wrong would have carried far more weight if human greed, which is found in every race, was acknowledged as the driving force behind much of the world's suffering.There was a joke with his sister calling the C.I.A. agent 'colonizer' but it fell flat as such because, again, it felt a little too much like they may have tried to be cute to get away with insinuating that only one race has ever expanded beyond it's borders of origin. And a lone ""white-boy"" as well but it seems in line with the intelligent, but immature, character.There was another slight jab about not building barriers at the end which was almost certainly a shot across the bow at America's southern border and the desire of many to prevent others from crossing illegally. In the Marvel universe it's hinted that Wakanda would use it's technology to help the world, and in the last shot shows that the first outreach center would be located in America to help those in need. It's a nice thought but sadly, we live in the real world where resources are more limited with the impact of fewer jobs, greater social welfare expenditure, likely crime because of not being able to determine the character(which is based on previous actions, in this case criminal) of those who enter the country or not is felt by the people not living in 'ivory towers'. It was too 'clean' of a message that those who need/want help should receive it regardless of the ramifications to the country meant to give it. Another memerable point was when T'Challa says that he can't speak for past kings and their actions. Although I question whether most will be able to understand the meaning of that it has to be pointed out as being a good point. Blaming those in the present for the happenings of the past is foolish at best and absurdly dangerous at worst. No group is without sins and all that can be done is to grow and make sure we don't repeat them in the future. The last point that resonated with me was when Killmonger referenced how some slaves would throw themselves overboard rather than live out their lives in misery and pain and said that death was better than bondage. This was the same reason America had it's Revolution. ""Give me freedom or give me death.""- Patrick Henry. Freedom is something never guaranteed and as Ronald Reagan said, ""Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction."" We see our individual freedoms slowly encroached upon until one day, we'll have them in name only. And even the divisiveness that is sown into society by media, power-hungry politicians and other forces with darker intent is a bondage of a type if we look to see how it prevents us from growing.
Of course, how the movie will be viewed is ultimately up to the individual and their experiences and their desire to be honest about all the problems that were presented in the movie. Some will see it and identify with Warmonger and decide that the ends justify the means if they get what they want. I would like to believe people will be more intelligent than that and see that the world isn't 'black' or 'white' but rather shades of grey(no, not that crappy movie trilogy they justwrapped up) and approach it in a thoughtful manner but only time will tell. All in all, I have to give this movie a very solid 4 stars. At the end of the day it's still a superhero movie but I have to give them credit for really trying to address real world issues like race and resources(even if people take a message that Disney might not have wanted them to take from it) that could very easily have been glossed over with few likely caring."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2019,2/10,"I did not watch this when it first came out as I was behind in my Marvel flix and needed to catch up. One day me and my wife decided to take the long road through all the Marvel movies starting with ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and based on timelines on various fan sites trudged through them one by one... then came Black Panther. When it ended my wife and I dutifully watched the end credits to catch the ""hints"" to whats coming up. When it was all over silence fell in the lounge room. Neither one of us said anything. I then muttered ""did that seem a bit political to you?""...that opened the flood gates. When a new evil King took over and others were left with the decision to follow or defy...of course the cool ones opposed that King. The Marvel ""resistance"" was born...here we go again. There is no other way to put it, but Marvel went Spike Lee on this one and that made it so hard to follow in some scenes and easy to predict in others. Of course factional oppressed forces join to overthrow/defeat the evil King and his evil agenda...Marvels version of the ""25th Amendment"". In the end the it may have been possible to save the Evil King but he chose death to honor slaves the died sailing to their new Plantation we have come to know as America. A bold statement on its own but it gets lost in the myriad of subliminal and overt political statements spattered throughout the whole movie. We watched this movie because we wanted to be entertained...and that did not happen. Being a fairly switched on minority that has chosen to map out my own destiny in life... hearing the words ""Great, another white boy for us to fix""...left me shaking my head. Such potential lost..."
BLACK PANTHER,20 May 2018,3/10,"This movie was good, but not even close to the insane amount of hype it got. Michael B Jordan is hands down the worst part of this movie. His acting is so bad, the fact that his character is just angry at the white man seemed like lazy writing and then couple that with the terrible acting of Michael B Jordan and well you get a bad guy who is predictable, boring and played by an actor who is just awful every time he opens his mouth. Chalk this up to another movie MBJ decided to take a dump all over. Without him this movie would have been great."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,9/10,"A very good movie all around, the beginning, middle and ending all tire together perfectly for a comprehensive story to feast on. Family secrets and revenge is the core of the story that makes a compelling story. The humor comes effortless that will make you laugh out loud and the action scenes are the icing on the cake."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"The one word I would use to describe Black Panther is WOW! I had been wanting to see Black Panther since T'Challa (aka Black Panther) played by Chadwick Boseman made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War. The huge hype surrounding the film added to my desire to see it, and I can tell you now that Black Panther does indeed live up to the hype. Plus Black Panthers new costume is on point!"
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2019,2/10,"Very very bad movie. Not entertaining at all. Why is it not possible to create a good movie with a black cast? Garuanteed disaster apparently.
Positive review are politics!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2021,4/10,"But the plot was an awful conflicted mess, and the actors deserved better. It was reminiscent of DC efforts like Suicide Squad.What was the whole Klaw opening about? Killmonger went through this elaborate plan then just tossed it aside and showed up in Wakanda?The fights were awful cgi, especially the last one.I almost enjoyed the first viewing, but now I can't get through 5 minutes of it without skipping forward to the less cringeworthy sections.High hopes for BPII that it will be one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original. WW84 sure wasn't. Ant Man 2 wasn't. Iron Man 2 wasn't. C'mon Feige - - Turn the great BP comic into a great movie. Excelsior!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"The story-line sticks to the comic book history and the acting my Chadwik Boseman and characters like Martin Freeman is worth watching however the over hyped technology marvels and inventions popping up like Candies in a Candy store are way too much over inflation.
I mean inventions popping up in Iron Man is understood, that is what Tony Stark is! An Inventor and a technology genius. However Black Panther has over killed it.Looks bad for Marvel to do something like this and make a total joke of Iron Man.The vision here is colluded. The story of T'Challa and Wakanda were important, not the ""candifying"" of inventions just like that. Another misadventure like this by MCU and they will taste failure I bet. Simply put, please stick to the authenticity and priorities in a comic book story line, over inflated deviations will cost you dearly."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2018,8/10,It's a good film but not one of the great.I am bit disappointing. It's over over over hyped and that's how the industries do business. By making people fool.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther starts off right after the events of Captain America: Civil War. King T'chaka (John Kani) is killed in a terrorist attack and his son T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to take over his mantle as king of Wakanda. Everything changes when old Wakandan foe Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and newcomer Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) are threatening to steal Wakandan resources (Vibranium, the strongest metal on earth) and expose the country for what it truly is: the richest and most technologically advanced country in the world. The movie bears the title of a Marvel movie, but it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie for the most part. In this case it works in the benefit of the movie. The thing about Marvel movies is that they are easy fun, they have a certain quality to them but are also predictable, loud and follow a certain formula that always leads to danger in the form of an apocalypse. In the introduction of the movie you get acquainted with the country and the culture of Wakanda as well as their characters, like Nakia (Lupita Nyongo'o), W'kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), M'baku (Winston Duke) Zuri, (Forrest Whitaker) standouts Okoye and Shuri (who are played wonderfully by Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright respectively) and with minor roles for Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown).It must be mentioned that this movie feels very complete and stands on its own without being dependent on other instalments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It feels like a crash course about Wakanda and their leaders and culture. Every story arc begins and ends in a logical, well-told and satisfying way. The characters talk about the future of Wakanda by discussing traditions and change. It has great social commentary and talks about Black lives and culture. Family and legacy. Loyalty and betrayal. Every scene of exposition ties into somebody's' personal story and serves a purpose. The Villain Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date. He is certainly up there with Vulture from Spider-man: homecoming and maybe even Loki. The incentives for the actions of Killmonger are so clear, you feel for this character for what he has been through in his life, even rooting for him at certain times during the film. However, he doesn't get the screen time he deserves. He is introduced for a scene in the beginning of the film and disappears for maybe an hour, which gives the movie some tonal differences.From a storytelling standpoint this movie excels, especially compared to other Marvel movies. Director Ryan Coogler once again shows us that he is here to stay. Because of him this movie just works. After Fruitvale Station and Creed, which were both very critically acclaimed, he comes with the most personal Marvel movie yet. scenes that will be remembered are the dramatic scenes, the acting, the chemistry between characters and the vibe of the movie instead of the action scenes, even though it's a superhero movie. The action scenes are the most underwhelming parts of the movie. Some scenes look too animated and look unfinished, while other scenes have too many jump cuts and shaky cam to really know what is going on. The action scenes are just not memorable. You can clearly see where the money from the budget was spent on because the set and costume designs are top notch. Unfortunately, this led to weaker CGI heavy action/fighting scenes. Overall, this was not just a good Marvel movie, this was a good movie, period. 
And even though the screenplay does not allow anything open for 
interpretation the movie does well by just telling a solid story. The Villain could've used more screen time, but the main and side characters are wonderful. The CGI could've been better, but the production design makes up for it. 8,5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,10/10,"Great film and meaningful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A lot of imdb reviewers have given this film a much lower score than it deserves, citing they don't like the ""politics"" of the movie. Interesting the same isn't being said of X-men or other Marvel films given their superheroes have always been political, but I digress. I suppose that once immersed in a world filled with black excellence and gender equality, it is easy for some to forget that race is ""political"" for all people of color. This film's box office success is reflective of how deeply it resonates with people all over the world. Those who allow themselves to accept the viewpoints of others who aren't white will likely find some of the film's universal themes of grief, family, pain, and identity resonating with them as well."
BLACK PANTHER,18 April 2018,7/10,"...this one is a little more than the usual cash crop for them. I am big fan of Marvel and DC movies though.
Story was good, a fun to watch in the theatre movie. 
A different super hero for a change..."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2019,3/10,Don't know what the hype is about this film! He's not even a game changer as a hero!
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,4/10,"I usually enjoy Marvel's movies, but I expected much more from this one. The advertisement was everywhere, almost each major website write about it. 
Maybe my expectation was too high, but I did not liked this movie at all."
BLACK PANTHER,12 April 2019,8/10,"Have you watched ""The Dark Knight""? Amazed by THE Joker? Wanted another villain like that in the superhero universe?Well Killmonger comes close. The reason why he fights is realistic and his origin story is heart-wrenching. He knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. And he will get it.I wish the movie was more about him then Black Panther (I mean I know the movie title is ""Black Panther"" but honestly Killmonger was a more interesting character; not that black panther wasn't at all). The movie should have shown more of him as he clearly had a hold on the audience. Also his dope soundtrack raised hairs on my neck (the metaphorical ones because I don't have any).The colors and the African city in the movie was great! Action sequence and choreography was great too! My favorite thing about the movie were the scenes/camera angles (That killmonger scene at like the half point in the move AHH)!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I'll keep this review brief...Ignore the haters or those who are trying to make this movie into a racial issue...Black Panther delivered an action-packed Marvel extravaganza! The actors brought life into their characters and not only was the action intense, the movie had a great storyline with eye-opening undertones! It was not too political or racial...it was the story of the Black Panther and it was spectacular in every way!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2019,2/10,"Black doesnt mean better, especially if plot is so bad"
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,2/10,"Oh dear. I managed to avoid spoilers before going to see this but, quite frankly, it wouldn't have mattered either way. This film has the most predictable script I've seen in a long time, to the point where me and my other half were able to tell each other what was going to happen next with a 100% level of accuracy for the entire film. Most MCU films I've seen (there are a few exceptions) have scripts that at least have some parts that surprise me. Not one bit of this travesty did.Realistically, any MCU film that isn't prefixed with ""Avengers"" is basically a filler film to move the narrative along. We all know this. Yet recent efforts like Thor: Ragnarok and both Guardians movies have been enjoyable and fun despite this. Black Panther felt like the writers scribbled this down while saying ""Well, the audience needs to know this so it has to go in the sequence. It doesn't matter if they don't enjoy it"". Every minute of it felt like a setup for Infinity War. And that makes me sad. Every move through the narrative felt laboured and clunky to the point where I nearly left the cinema.My biggest bugbear of all though (and this is where the SPOILERS appear), is how they wasted the best villain they've created in years. Hell, it might be the best villain they've EVER created. Michael B Jordan is sublime in his role as the antagonist and puts in quite probably the finest performance in a MCU film (closely battling Brolin's Thanos). He was cold, calculating, brutal and, most importantly, totally believable. And then they killed him. I was genuinely so angry that I gave an audible FFS in the cinema. This film is a crime against cinema. It gets an extra point for Jordan's performance which makes it all the more frustrating that they killed him off. I wanted to like it so much but it's impossible."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,9/10,"THE BLACK PANTHER
My late reviewI finally saw the movie. I must admit a speculative fiction movie is just not my first choice in movies. After seeing ""Furious 7,"" I promised myself I wouldn't waste my valuable time again. I also admit that my only intentions for seeing the movie was to support this movie because it's based on Afro American History. Although the movie is fiction much of the story is true. I suspect many other people saw the movie for the same reason. It is a great movie. The movie kept a fast action packed tempo that was easy to follow from beginning to end. There were several A Listed Actors that played their parts to perfection. Whoever chose the cast couldn't have done a better job. Angela Basett, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jorden, Forrest Whitaker; those names sell movie tickets! I have never saw a more beautiful cast of actors. I'm sure the actors hard bodies were a marketing factor. Their skin was smooth, chocolate, shinny, and even toned. After the movie I had the craving for a Hershey Bar; yes, that good. Although the entire film wasn't shot in Africa the locations were nothing short of paradise. The use of animated animals was risky but also well done. I kept thinking, there is no way this movie was written by one person. There was just soooo much going on. The brilliant writers Ryan Coogler, Joe Robert Cole, and Jack Kirby tied the conclusion of the story in to the opening scene perfectly. The time jump from summer to winter wasn't clear to me. I don't even think the change of seasons was necessary. I think they could have used a better substance for snow. One thing that really stuck out for me was the way one character died in the end of the movie. I don't think the actor acted out a dying man well. I think it took way to long for the character to die. I have to charge the actor and the director for that. This movie is very educational. It is not your typical super hero movie. I have strong doubt that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. GO SEE THE MOVIE!Peace and BlessingsErik Smalls

BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2018,3/10,Michael b jordan just dosent make a good villan! I found myself disinterested after he became highly involved in the movie.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,2/10,"Lower your expectations, guys, the movie is kinda bad.
Even if we put aside the whole weird concept of an alternative world with an African country as a center of technology and scientific knowledge... which is probably plain compensation of racial problems... And all contradictions like unlikliness of any development and progress in such a conservative and traditional culture. And high possibility to face power crisis any time with the current method of inheriting throne...
Beside all that the plot is predictable, dialogues are boring. Characters are flat, you don't percieve them as living persons... way too much cliches
I expected a lot more..."
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,3/10,"This film was so hyped, I actually waited to rent it. I am glad I did. So disappointing. I personally did not connect to the hero and found the female lead characters so much more compelling. Effects were good, acting was good, but I can only see one reason why this film did so well, and please do not get upset with me, but it was due to the majority of the cast being black and that the film was set in a futuristic African Wakanda.
There was actually nothing that stood out as different (apart from the cast ethnicity) whereas the latest Thor film was a triumph in delivering something different and entertaining. This could just as well have been a Netflix film.
I may now be so prejudiced regarding Marvel films after the fantastic Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers Infinity stones, but when you set the bar high, your fan base come to expect much of the same in terms of quality and entertainment."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,6/10,"This is my first review on IMDB. I was impressed by the visuals, costumes, music and I enjoyed the movie. I would have given it a 7/10 but wait a minute.The movie is breaking box office records, nothing wrong with that, but to say it is doing so because it is worthy is completely unjustified. The movie is hyped purely on the basis of ""racial"" aspects.Today, the movie grossed higher than The Dark Knight and many simple minded people are claiming it to be better than TDK? Are you serious? This was not even on the same level as the worst of the Dark Knight trilogy.Every marvel movie is somewhat overrated but this one knocks it out of the park."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,6/10,"I gave this move 6 of 10. That is also a 3 of 5.Allot of reviews tend to give the higher score of 7 or 8 for movies like this.. And movies in general. 
IMDB is misleading the revies letting people give movies 7 to 10.
This movie is not worth 7 and up. 25% of voters gave it 10?? Thats not possible...Im starting to wonder if hollywood is using bots to vote... Same thing with the star wars movies... So many people giving it 10..... Thats an A or a 5.This voting system is corrupt!! People voting dont think 6 is good.... 6 is a good movie.. But since they dont know their math they think a good move is 7 and above...
6 is good. 8 is really good.. 10 is excellent.... There is just a handfull of movies that can have a 10.. If any...7 and 9 is just a number that is used when the lower number of 6 and 8 should be the correct one...So once again.. the voting system is corrupt"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,3/10,"People say its original, with a refreshing new villain, with no connection to the avengers story and overall a great story.To be honest i think we have seen these kind of stuff in the 20 previous marvel movies. Is it just me or all marvel movies have the exact same linear pattern, same story, same ending with zero innovations?It is just a superhero movie, with a lot of action and nothing else to offer, I really don't think there is a substance under all this CGI."
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2018,1/10,"Title pretty much sums it up. Extremely overrated as everyone mentioned. Not entertaining in the least bit, and I really did have such high hopes. You will easily forget you're watching a Marvel Movie watching this."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,9/10,"Out of the cliche action hero, with a muscular body, blonde sexy hair, and never caught a bullet. This film giving all new meaning about Hero. It's not a cute blonde man, with those bright blue eyes, gazed you upon the silver screen. It's about the cultural and independent being, that emancipate people to do best. This film is the answer to the diversity issue in hollywood, and it's empowering people with fun, powerful, and yet tasteful narratives. Marvel really done a good job with this. Tres bien."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,5/10,"Interesting story line, great camera work. Sorta OK . Why is it this successful. Walked out sorta disappointed. My son liked it because it was a marvel film, but my husband and I were just yea its Ok . ..."
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2018,3/10,"If this is critically acclaimed and highly rated, how bad must a flick be to get a low rating?To be fair: Black Panther is not exactly a bad movie - it simply isn't a good one either. It's just formulaic, by-the-numbers, plotless, shallow superhero-mainstream featuring an all black cast sporting a white sidekick, making it kind of an inverse Iron Man 2. Some CGI is cringeworthy. Character development can't happen since the movie lacks characters, exclusively relying on stereotypes.Partly entertaining but doesn't live up to the hype. Don't waste your money - see on TV or Netflix when available."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,5/10,"When the Black Panther was first seen in Captian America: Civil War, everyone was excited for the first African superhero. So when the film released to success and praise from most fans, the hype grew around the character. Obviously, when the trailer for the Black Panther was released, the hype grew to an unrealistic level. Depending on who you ask, the film either delivers on the hype or it did not. In this review I will talk about what I liked and what I didn't like about this film. To begin with the things I liked, I will talk about Andy Serkis's character of Ulysses Klaue. In my opinion, Andy Serkis portrayed this villain better than almost any other villain in marvel behind the Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Loki in every other marvel movie. Klaues early death in this film was saddening to me but also a necessary development in the plot since even in death he progressed the plot on for Killmonger to get into Wakanda. Second, I will talk about Killmonger, the second villain in the film. He is a villain with heart, which I can't say about most villains. He actually has depth and doesn't want to just destroy the world like most comic book villains. His intentions were good but were incrediblely stupid. I will talk about him a bit more later. Last on the likes side, the costume and set design were phenomenal. Oscar worthy even. The extras were even good as extras. They weren't doing weird things. On to the dislikes, I will start start with the plot. The plot is generic. It has been told before. I assume that everyone has heard of the plot type before. Establish hero, establish villain, villain travels to town/kingdom, villain challenges and appears to kill hero, villain shows he's evil, hero gets back and regains strength, hero kills or defeates the villain. This plot will stand the rest of time for how generic it is. Killmonger is next on the list. Despite his good intentions, his ideas were incredibly stupid. Only in today's society would think that giving futuristic weapons to a group of people to let them fight there way out of trouble would be a good idea. Overall this movie wasn't half bad. Was it new? Spectacular? Or even good? Not particularly. I consider this movie to be on the list of movies that arnt bad but have been made to many times before. Take Kingsman: The Golden Circle or The Hobbit Trilogy for example. Both are good movies. It suck if compared to there predecessors. I give this film a solid 5/10 for not being good or bad. Just right there in the middle. It didn't live up to the hype, even a smaller margin of the hype wasn't achieved, in my opinion. But mainly, it didn't bring anything new to the table."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2018,8/10,"This is a kids action movie that doesnt demand too much thinking and it delivers exactly what it proposes, in that regard its an 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,2/10,"While I am happy to see African American succeed, Black Panther is nothing to celebrate. It is another endless superhero movie with more special effects than substance. And although it attempts to approach important racial subjects, this critical dialog needs to be had somewhere other than a movie screen. Perhaps the most ridiculous viewpoint comes from the movie's villain who ultimately chooses death because his ancestors would have chosen death over slavery."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2020,1/10,"It's a clear example of ""hype"". I can't believe how how hard the media pushed for this movie, after watching it for 30 min I couldn't take it anymore and switched it off.Awful acting, poor plot build up and very dumb dialogues. It's almost embarrassing"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,,Opinions are obviously subjective but just taking a quick glance at these reviews.....my goodness they wreak of a people with a severe inferiority complex. This movie at the very least is on par with any and other Marvel movie and deserve reviews as such. My you trolls are hungry today.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2019,1/10,Trash movie. If I were black I'd think it was trash.
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,10/10,"Everything was amazing.
the characters,the idea, the music and literally everything.
i don't understand why people are hating on it.
like they showed us so much things that we don't see it in real life 
how women and especially black women are strong and beautiful.
there's so many other things that are so good in this fricking movie
i loved it and i will watch over and over because it's so goddamn good.
i want a part 2 it really deserves to be a movie series"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,5/10,"I really don't understand how people doesn't figure out how racist this movie is .. this movie supposed to celebrate black culture where in fact he's mocking it .. the story said that even when black people had the most advanced technology in the world they're still ruled by barbaric ways ( like the way they chose thier king ) ..
Aside from that .. poor story telling and poor acting except for micheal b jordan and andy serkis .. 
5 of 10 is too generous .. may be because i'm a huge comics fan .."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Hey all, with Avengers Infinity Wars is around the corner Black Panther is roaring at the box office worldwide. You can't miss this extravaganza, because if you do so then actually you are missing an art film which is crafted so well that each frame is splendid. Since release, people are talking about this movie and already broke some opening weekend collections at the box office surpassing major superhero/action films.From the start to the last, every scene is scripted well in a manner that you will definitely realize how a king should be. It took 10 years & 17 movies to bring this connection between characters especially the king T'Challa aka Black Panther. Last you saw him in Captain America Civil War which made everyone want this character more and led this epic movie to be a success.The movie is all about a fictional nation Wakanda (in South Africa) and element Vibranium (fictional). The story revolves around T'Challa his family, foes and loved ones where Politics is much more highlighted. The strong bond between T'Challa & Shuri is really appreciable which is rarely seen in any movies. The tech used by Wakanda is far more ahead than any of Tony's techs. The leader of Special forces/chief security head of the king is loyal to the kingdom. In between, you may feel that you are seeing Hollywood version of Kattappa (Baahubali).Movie lags in between which is correct because Director Ryan Coogler wants the audience to understand the character very well which they can later connect him with other members of the Avengers team. He is not only the King of Wakanda but also the King of MCU and he deserves the respect. Because many questions will be answered at the end and we can expect some blast in Avengers Infinity Wars. Actions sequences are for more well choreographed. Wakanda kingdom, people, traditions etc are visualized beautifully. Official movie runtime is 130 minutes which is honestly acceptable for this wonderful movie. Many things to be said, but this much is enough and rest you can experience at nearby theatres.Tony Stark is definitely going to be jealous of him. Must watch movie for everyone.Bold, Beautiful & Epic. Ratings: 4.5/5"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,10/10,"Go see this movie. Great plot, loved the cultural aesthetics, amour and the jewelry. The cinematography is just wonderful!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2018,9/10,This film is yet another success but more then that it felt like a statement to modern problems in the world. At points of this film you fee for both sides of the conflict and can relate with the feelings of these characters. This is one of the few Marvel films where the villain is 100% a bad guy but you still care enough to invest in him.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,1/10,"Why is Black Panther the biggest scam of all black movies ever??Have you wondered why so much promotion has been lavished, on this
studio production (gathering by the way the youngest pearls of black
cinema), and worldwide...
At least the fact that a big studio embraced such a project should
have made you tick...What's the message? What bs is hiding behind it?
Here it is, my 'brethens', in a nutshell:
Black social case kid with strong revolutionary message is a big
threat to money, white of course-even if here it has been given black
faces. It is an Orwellian tale, indeed...Who is Wakanda? Wakanda is peopled by Oreo Cookie duplicated ad
nauseum, it is OreocookieLand as a matter of fact-or what Malcolm
would have called the House....brothers, whereas social case kid is the
Field....brother. Thus, Wakanda elite have the money, the knowledge, the
power, and most important they share knowledge with white dude. By the
way, white dude talks black and he lets you handle everything because,
of course, he is 'mr. niceguy'. (By the way, have you ever seen a white
dude taking a bullet for a sister? I haven't...not in this world we live
in.)Doesn't it seems to you that Wakanda is the Western World with a black
face - like a masquerade, a new minstrel show, every black man's hope,
deep inside?So, of course, you have again symbols of dependence -Mr. Nice guy will
of course help oreocookie peeps. The second addiction, which I had
already noticed in Blade, is a drug-here it is some ancestral blueish
hallucinogenic 'thang' they drink, as if they could not summon enough
strength within, and of course, 3rd addiction: prayer, this time to
the ancestors. Of course, you have the ridiculous gear that Marvel
heroes always wear...the one piece suit, that make men's ass real
tight...They even threw in some martial arts to try to make it look
real...Come on, peeps!Yeah they sold it to you fine, this one! You've got gotten...You've been
played! So who cares if all the cast is black? Down the line, we've
gotten bamboozled one more time.Watch out people: what they want is to make the struggle wrong.Of course social kid, the 'black monster' (even defined as such by
King of Wakanda) is given as a product of your own doing-since his
uncle abandoned him, which erases all the real bad conditions of
systemic racism and you were so excited that almost everybody
(finally!) is black in that movie that you did not see the real
message of this real killer movie.Because it is here to kill our thirst for justice. It makes justice
seekers the monsters. What is really at stake here is the fear of big
money, at the emergence of an educated black intelligentsia issued
from the ghetto.And wait with all the promo...they have created a cornucopia of products
to sell you, because money has to be made again, on black folks'
dreams... An orgy of shopping for lack of hope!The only thing i can tell you is: go beyond appearances. Hollywood is
a clich√© machine whose strongest function is to create ideologies,
sets of beliefs to live by. And the well being of black people is
still not on their very conservative agenda!Beware what they feed you lavishly...They would not insert money into
anything that could topple the power of their chosen elite.My thoughts go to the black panthers-the real heroes who fought for a
cause and died in shame and bad repute... This film repackages the
concept into something hollow, a farce that does not render to these
dedicated fighters for black freedom the recognition they deserve!After 2nd thought, I deem the fostered division between the diaspora
and the Motherland the most treacherous message of that flick.
Imagine. Africa would stop being a cash cow, if ever Blacks united
beyond borders: they killed panafricanism once for all!And if you ask me, I'll say - I'd rather watch again:
Undercover brother, Baadaass, Get out, Do the right thing...etc. These
were soul movies.My review of Black Panther does not question the brilliant performance
of its actors. I still think the cast was outstanding and the
cinematography impeccable!Hey...They might even give it an oscar;
i'll call it the Oscar of all Scams!Damn, they also got me too...And sorry to burst your little Marvel bubble!
It's wake up or Wakanda!Wakanda, or...Wake up right now!
Which one will you choose?
;)LM ARNAL, writer and painter"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,7/10,"The movie surprised me actually, I thought it would turn out to be okay, but no. The story is a bit too predictable, visually it's a dream. Really liked the Wakanda greeting. For me, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman and Chadwick Boseman saved the movie to a 7,5 but since we're on IMDB i can ""only"" give a 7.Not really a spoiler, but in the after credits scene I really disliked the fact they didn't have the big reveal..."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,6/10,"The hype surrounding this movie was too much, I get why alot of people liked it and that's obvious but don't be naive in thinking this is an amazing movie because the truth is it isn't. Let's be clear it's not a bad movie but it's just simply boring there's not enough action in the movie there's alot of talking and some glaring mistakes and poor acting. I don't want to blast this film because there is good things about it ( the black panther suit and eric killmonger where the coolest things about this movie ) but it's overrated and a movie I probably won't watch again unfortunately."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is a great movie. It has plenty of flaws, but none that really should discourage you from seeing it. The only thing that really bugs me is the terrible, obnoxious hype for just an average film for Marvel. It doesn't have an underlying message or stands for empowerment. It has none of that. What it does have is black leads who do a good job and a fanbase larger than Michael Bay's ego. Chadwick Boseman's character, T'Challa, becomes the Black Panther after his father dies, and must fight to protect his kingdom, all while trying to live up to the previous Black Panther's legacy.The graphics, acting, and general scale of this movie is astonishing. Not much else can be said. This movie takes you on a trip you can only really remember for a short while. What you will remember is the media circus about how 'This movie changes the course of cinema' or 'The black community has changed in so many different ways'. There are better movies that get empowerment and representation across better than Black Panther. Ryan Coogler made a wonderful experience that, when watching, has nothing but action to offer on a dark-skinned platter.Chadwick Boseman made Black Panther interesting. As the star of the show, he makes his way pretty good. Michael B. Jordan, however, was the real master of acting in the film. Him as Killmonger was a match made in heaven. Lupita Nyong'o was very entertaining and well-written, and Danai Gurira was badass and awesome. Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke did just fine, and they made the film better, but not like MBJ did. Letita Wright was funny, except for the awful, awful dead memes that she referenced (you know which ones). Angela Bassett was entertaining, and Forest Whitaker did amazing (two performances that no one seems to mention). But the two that were easily my favorites were Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. They may the only two white actors, but they were still entertaining. Seeing Freeman act in such an exotic and strange culture was great, and Serkis did phenomenal in being intimidating and yet still crazy. Overall, an A- in the acting department.Black Panther is just another Marvel movie. If you want to see it, good. I recommend it. For me, I just find it very average and okay. The acting is great, the visuals are great, things seem fluent and balanced, and the real film isn't very political. 7 out of 10!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2018,8/10,I am not in mood for for this kind of movies but I've just seen it because of last its nominations in golden globe awards after all it changed my mind to good truck .it has precious to see it at least for one time .
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,When I watched this movie and set a time in cinema I sleep because this movie sucked and just condor Very strong country that never have any threat but this movie but anything to this app this country to tell you the story and poor story for visuals and poor acting very strong country that never have any threat but this movie but anything to this app this country to tell the story and poor story poor visuals and poor acting acting
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,9/10,"Apart from the fact that this is a major step forward for black representation in movies of this genre, Black Panther actually comes across as that rare beast, an intelligent superhero movie. It certainly resonates with the isolationist politics currently in vogue and offers a critcism against them (with subtle refrences to Trumps ""wall"") but for me it was that the characters themselves (with a notable exception) were well rounded and motivated. The weak link was the character of Klaw. A one dimensional nutter who's only purpose was to be the stock racist South African and to kill people needlessly. In truth a lot of the usual tropes are here love interest, good guy gets defeated good guy comes back, bad guy kills nice people etc. but on the whole it is well done and the visuals especially of Wakanda city are beautiful. I espcially liked the references to African culture which added a nice flavour to the look of the film. On the basis of this I would watch another one."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,10/10,"Dont listen to what the other people say. This is different to a normal superhero film as it tackles subjects like racism, poverty and slavery which takes the film in a different direction. There are many good points to be made about this film including the link to culture but im going to make this quick. This was a hood fun enjoyable film that i would argue is the best marvel film but its different and not for everyone but there is no doubt that this film is made with care. Im not saying it should win Oscars but for a superhero film this is above the rest especially the recent pile of garbage called spiderman homecoming. If you gavent already GO WATCH BLACK PANTHER you wont regret it."
BLACK PANTHER,14 October 2018,1/10,"I'm so glad to see all the 1 and 2 star reviews for this - I listened to the hype, that it was supposed to be one of the best Marvel films ever made.. well, i'm 25 minutes in and what a load of garbage. Childish film-making, bad CGI - don't think I'm going to watch the whole thing, or might just fast forward past all the tribe stuff and get to the points where he's dressed like a big cat."
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,3/10,"Hitting and more hitting. I guess that is what Marvel means by BAM.
I couldn't wait until it was over. I love Michael B Jordan but long to see him in a drama.
I don't read comic books so I'll stay away from comic book movies too."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"I'm going give the GOOD, BAD, and VERDICT.GOOD: Characters- To be quite honest, I thought it was extremely spot on with the casting for this film. Everyone brought their A game to do their character for this film. This is one of the few marvel movies that every single character has a time to shine and has a purpose for being in the movie. Humor - It does a great job with its humor for the most part for not making it feel forced. It flows extremely well in this movie. They used it in a way to not put a joke in there to take a character's behavior out of place. It's in a way that they use the character's personalities as tools to set up and make a joke, which is fantastic and real. CGI (PART 1)- The CGI they use in most of the scenery was really nice to look at. They make Wakanda look so beautiful and alive, also the way they use it for the technology in the movie is extremely impressive. Action- The action in this film might take a turn for some people, because it's really different and unique compared to some past MCU movies. It goes more towards a ""Raw, Brutal, Tribal type of fighting style."" I first it took me awhile to get used to it, but then I ended appreciating the way they did it after the movie. Villains- Everyone probably heard that Erik Killmonger played by (Micheal B. Jordan) is one of the greatest villains in the MCU, tied with Loki. I'm here to say: ABSOLUTELY!!! His character has a presence about him that he is really threatening. You also get a feel towards him that you say: ""I know that your methods are wrong, but on terms of what your goal is, you have a point."" You understand his reasons for what and why he is in the movie. Klaw was very entertaining to watch on screen as well. He was very enjoyable to watch with Andy Serkis' energy for the character.Score- The music in this film is great, I enjoyed every single song that came with each scene. (I might end up buying the album.)BAD: 2 MAJOR ISSUES: 1. the third act, kind of lost it's way and it became ""Let's stop the bad guy"" rush mode.2. I think the movie should have been a tad bit longer. To put a little more depth for the third act. Also to give Erik Killmonger a little more screen time for his presence was a key to keep the flow of the movie going. VERDICT: But overall I had blast watching this film for it's great development, characters, unique style, overall story, and understandable motives. I highly recommend watching if you are a huge Marvel fan!!! 7.8 out of 10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 October 2018,6/10,I prefer the Captain America Civil War T Challa more than the Ryan Coogler version of T Challa. This movie has the exact plot of lion king with a mixture of The Dark Knight Rises
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,7/10,"SPOILER: I went into Black Panther with very low expectations, seeing as how I didn't really like him in Civil War. I was happy to see this movie was a good one. It is overrated (just a tad) but overall it's pretty damned good.Dislikes
So, the CGI is a bit heavy at times, almost drawing away from the experience, especially the larger battle sequence near the end with the rhinos. Likes 
The casting was great. Boseman was phenomenal, with his costar Michael B Jordan. Also, Letitia Wright as Shuri was astounding, I really loved her performance, and people who were saying the ""what are those"" joke was cringey, ya it was, that's kinda the point. But do keep in mind this movie takes place in 2016, when that trend was popular."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"At beginning, let me clarify I am an greedy DC fan. In my vision, Black panther is the Marvel version of Batman. So, before seeing the movie, I didn't have any high expectations to this character. Just another version of Batman.
But let's face it - this is an different movie. 
First of all, whole film some feeling would get a hold in my mind. Am i watching a modern interpretation of Lion King or Marvel version of Agent 007 ? 
I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. And at the same time, a classy DISNEY film. That is not to say it is bad, but film where Black Panther supposed to get his own movie, not about his character a bit disappointed me. They focused way too much on portraying a political, racial, African cultures and futuristic African dreamland ""Wakanda"". Where illustrated how powerful black people are, even females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous. #feminism The Black Panther character was used just only as driving force to next scene. Despite this issue, the plot is solid and the actors are excellent. Especially Michael B. Jordan character (Killmonger) who provides a great contrast with a potent motivation. I can say, one of interesting villains in Marvel universe. Other characters are just complimentary for this movie. 
As usually Visual effects and CGI were stunning, there was a little gaps with some poor lighting, but probably problem accrued from quality of our local Cinema. 6 out of 10 (If i have to classify this film as Marvel film) 
8 out of 10 ( as Disney film)"
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,10/10,"What can I say about this movie excpet it is my new favorite marvel movie, as it is every other sane person's. Beauty upon beauty upon beauty. Excellence followed by excellence followed by excellence. Bless this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,4/10,"This has to be the most Overhyped Movie I've seen this Year many saying this was the Best Superhero Movie, which felt like a pretty Bold Statement, but Therfore i was intrigued to see what all the Hype was about an... Boy was this Movie a Huge Letdown, now I really wanted to Like this Movie Black Panther was one of the best parts of Civil War an i was looking forward to where they'd take his character and they did Nothing with his Character he already had a Great Arc in Civil War as a Side Character yet somehow in his own Movie he feels Bland and That's the worst thing a Marvel Character can be cause they make Great Choices with the Actors that can Elevate the Material there Given, Chadwick Boseman who is a Great Actor was not good in this an I hate to say that cause his Scene in Civil War was some of the Best Acting I'd seen in a Marvel Movie, so for his First Solo Movie to be so Plain and feels empty which Sucks cause each Marvel Movie has a Distinct Tone an Vision the Director Brings, but Ryan Coogler who made Creed which is so Much Better than its Deserves to be, has made a Movie that feels like it has No Personality, its up there with Dr Strange or Ant-Man in terms of Style an even those Movies had Creative Action Scenes which all the Marvel Movies have done a pretty Great Job delivering, the Action in this besides a pretty Cool Car Chase which is elevated by the Music, any other action scene was Very Poorly handled from Terrible CGI and its not like the Movie doesn't have the Budget they just half-assed it when it came to the Action, Each Marvel Movie before has done a Good job with being Fun Popcorn that'll entertain, but this is one of the least Entertaining Movies they've put out in a while it was Boring in parts an that's the worst thing these Movies can be is Boring cause if the Action Sucks than the only thing you can Enjoy is the Story an Character's, Before seeing this I'd heard comparisons to Game of Thrones, and James Bond, besides the Normal Outsider comes to Dethrone the King that reminded me of The Lion King, it brings nothing New or Fresh to the Table besides a pretty Good Soudtrack, but other than that the Story was Generic you can predict where the stories can go, there was a Twist in the Movie that somewhat surprised me but that's pretty much it. The Characters in these Movies have had pretty strong Side Character's i can't say the same for this Movie, the Only Entertaining Character is Michael B Jordan as one of the better Marvel Villians but he feels like he's barley in the Movie he has his Introduction Scene, then leaves for awhile an doesn't return til the Low point Of the Story that Most of these Movies have an it was so Cliched an I don't get how People thought he was Dead in that scene, and if you ask me that scene should've taken place earlier in the Movie then we could see the Struggle of Black Panther coming back to the Throne but he just leaves for 10 mins an shows up then Beats the Bad Guy an everyone Wins, So Michael B Jordan is the Best Part of this Movie but he's barley in it enough so What are we left with... Well all of the other Characters are pretty Boring to watch not just the Character's but the scenes there in feel Pointless all they do is walk around and talk about unnecessary Stuff, the only interactions that where entertaining was Black Panther an his Sister who was a good Character until she became the ""Comedic Relief"" her Jokes didn't get a single laugh from me an besides making Cool Gear for the Hero she doesn't really have much of a Character, the Script feels rather Dry almost Like it was Written an Directed by a Machine it cause besides one Cool Shot nothing about this Movie felt Unique like everyone is Praising it to be, Before this Movie I had seen Thor Ragnarok an that Movie captures everything you'd Want from a Marvel Movies its Funny, its Creative, you can Feel the Director's Vision an Style it felt Different. This was a huge Downgrade over Ragnarok, an it is one of the Most Generic Superhero Movies I've seen in awhile so if your one of those People that Loves it cause you feel Empowered by having a Black Superhero Movie that's Great I just can't say i feel the same way, there are much better ""Black Movies"" out there as this is being called and Overall I'd give this a 4/10 it was very Dissapointing to Me besides one Cool Action scene along with one Good Performance this movie felt like one of the first Marvel Movies like Thor or Captain America but with a slightly better Budget but they didn't use it as well as they could've"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,10/10,This movie was awesome and i just love black panther so much now. and the way it ends with Michael B. Jordan dying was sad but it made sense. this was the first movie i ever liked Michael B. Jordan in.
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,7/10,"I found this a solid movie really enjoyed it but it some flaws. The story was thin it was pretty predictable like thr scene where killmonger throws black panther from the waterfall he could have easilly stabbed him to death but by throwing him of the waterfall they could make him land good so he could survive. but its a superhero movie so one of the main reasons i go and see them is for their action. Its not every scene in the movie is predictable though, take the moment when the first villain dies. If you hadn't seen any trailers and are new to this hero this would come as a big surprise i really liked that. The cgi was not that great but al those people said that it sucked are just searching for flaws because it was good most of the time, in the final fight the cgi was a bit hindering for me but in the rest of the movie didn't bother me at all. i get that a movie about an african civilization should have african people but why are they wearing acient clothes? I don't get that but maybe thats only bothering me. Also one scene was one of the most racist scenes i have ever seen in a modern movie why are they making monkey noises when the cia agent starts speaking i don't know if it is racist to white people or racist to black people but i think its racist. I don't like all the pollitcal influence around the movie it doesn't have anything to do with the movie it self so i don't give this any influence to the grade but why do people give this movie praise for being with only black actors it shouldn't make a difference if a movie is played by a white guy/woman or by a black guy/women. I don't think you can grade a movie on the political corectness take a movie like wonderwoman this movie gets compared to black panther although they have a completelly different story but why do they get compared because they stand out in their politcal influence the one is about woman and their opression and the other one about black people and their opression in pollitcal terms. why should you compare a movie because of that i don't get it and i think its wrong. But over all if i judge the movie alone its prettt solid but has his flaws."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"All of my friends said that this movie was awesome and that it was amazing. I went in there thinking that was what i was gonna think, but i was wrong. If you haven't seen any of the trailers, don't. You might enjoy this movie. The trailer gives away almost every cool part of the movie. I liked Chadwick Boesman as Black Panther. He did excellent. I think the movie should've had him in it more.The villain was great but I didn't like that they got rid of Andy Serkis, They had a great thing going with his arm that was made of vibranium. It was literally one of the reasons I came into the film. I wanted more of him in it. I also thought that the villain had a motivation that ended as soon as he got impaled by that spear. Did he just give up as soon as he was taken to the sunset? I also thought there was too much king drama. I wanted more fight sequences. There were more ""Challenges"" than actual confrontations.Overall, I liked the film but I didn't think it was the best Marvel movie since Iron Man."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,7/10,I went to see this movie probably with too high hopes due to fantastic reviews from critics but it wasnt the worst movie i ever seen it had giid action good plot and fun humor it was just a bit boring in the begging but after it sped ip it was fantastic i say go see it have a good time
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,7/10,So i went to see this movie recently and while i expected more action and adventure i did have a really nice time the humor was funny the action was good 'when it was there' and most of the characters were likeable i totally recomend you watch it
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,6/10,"I want to start this review saying that I think it's really silly that this movie has caused a political discussion. Not because the movie and marketing didn't ask for it, but after watching the film, the movie is really nothing more than another marvel film. The movie does things better and worse compared to other marvel films, but as it stands outside of the spectrum, it's predictable and isn't anything more than a superhero film. I'm very glad we have a superhero film that is this heavy in the representation of the black community during this age of popularity in superhero films, but that's really as far as any ""political stance"" should go into this film.As a movie, it's fine. There wasn't any moment in the film where I felt impressed from what I was looking at, and there were times where I know Marvel can do better. Lets start with what I think it did superior to other marvel films.1. The music. I think this is hands down the best original soundtrack we have gotten from a marvel film, and this is easily on par with the actual usage of their soundtrack outside of the guardian movies. Instead of being generic samey orchestra music that is used in every marvel film, we now have a soundtrack that sticks out from others in the franchise. 2. The villains. Marvel has been getting better with their villains since Guardians Vol 2. And this movie has two. Both of which were my favorite performances in the film, being Michael B Jordan and Andy Serkis respectfully. It's really refreshing also seeing a villain you can root for this time around.3. The designs of the characters, world and weapons. How the CGI looked is a topic for later, but i loved the world of Wakanda and watching the characters walk around it. And every character had something in their design that felt right for the character they were playing.And that's really about it. And those things listed above aren't anything real impressive, just good. Now for the negatives. The CGI and all the effects were horrid. And I can't believe some people are trying to say it was passable. Every time the camera was zoomed out and black panther was on screen he looked straight out of a video game. It was superman in Justice League levels of bad. This goes for most of the environments, spaceships, animals etc. I know CGI is necessary for this movie and I'm not bashing CGI, but when you film outside couldn't you just use the outside? what's the point of the green screen and why does it look so bad? Anytime they were in a room that didn't have anything more than 1 level, it was clearly CGI city. Also the jokes. Marvel movies are known for being pretty funny and generally I agree even when the jokes ruin perfectly good scenes, (cough cough Ragnarok, cough cough Guardians 2) the jokes in this movie gave me a smile at most. And I think a dreamworks executive might of mixed his script into this one because there is a ""what are those"" joke, a ""I make it rain"" joke, and a ""whip her hair back and forth"" joke. Way to slap a stamp on this movie that says ""this was made in the 2010's""While the negatives of this film affect my overall score pretty greatly as they are significant parts in the film, the rest of the film is very okay. The story and plot is okay. The dialogue outside of the jokes is okay. The action is okay. If it wasn't for the original setting and feel of the theme in the music this movie would be right alongside Doctor Strange and Ant Man as just another stepping stone for the marvel franchise. I'm glad I watched it, I still enjoyed it, I'm just really not rushing at all to see it again."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Don't get me wrong, this is probably not much worse than most other comic book movies, but it has really been given way, way too much hype.Storyline is another lame run-of-the mill story, characters all run standard storylines and overall it's just... you know. You've seen it all before. Nothing new to see here.I think it's only been given the props it's been given because...Meh.""Don't believe the Hype!!''"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,3/10,"Did you ever see that movie Troy from 2004? (or maybe 2003 or 2005. . sometime around then).
This movie is exactly the same. People fighting with killing to be the one in charge with a hot, sexy man walking around shirtless the whole time.
I don't even understand how this constitutes as a super hero movie, because he wasn't walking around saving people in distress from crime in the middle of the night or nothing.
Nothing really happens in the movie. It's a lot of mindless violence. People get killed for no reason. People kill people without thinking twice and with no remorse. A lot of people brought their little kids to see this movie of violent slayings
And sex god, Chadwick Boseman, is shirtless for most of the movie, which is why I bumped it up from 1 star to 3. Because I like myself some eye candy.
I should probably just stop seeing anything by Disney altogether, because I was born in the 1980s, and I don't think I ever seen anything Disney that wasn't a remake of something else, or based on old fairy tales, or comics that were already tv shows in the 1960s."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"I am a big time marvel movie fan. I watched every single marvel movie that is out at least more than once. There are my favorite ones and some that i don't like... and i hate DC movies period. This is my first time writing a review because I want to stop this madness of this over-hyped movie to waste money out of movie-goers precious pocket...This black panther has to be the worst marvel movie ever... it was boring boring and boring. Cultures are depicted in the most cringe and utterly disgusting and weird way. This was a total garbage for me compared to Iron man, Avengers, Guardians of Galaxy, Thor, Captain America and all the other Marvel movies that gave us at least some sort of excitement. Probably because i had such high expectation from Marvel even before walking into the theater. I definitely thought this movie was not entertaining at all... Do not waste your money at the theater watching this movie and I still don't get how the review average is still at 7.5/10 even after all these negative reviews..."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,10/10,"Coogler does an amazing job developing this film's protagonist and antagonist. T'challa's (Chadwick Boseman) character has so much depth to him and is challenged in so many ways as he tries to become the best king possible for Wakanda. It is amazing to see how much he matures from the beginning of the film to the end. This film's antagonist, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is everything you need a villain to be. His backstory is portrayed perfectly and it gives him understandable motives. Driven by those motives, he pushes T'challa to his limits. Whenever there is such a good antagonist like this, you get the most out of your protagonist.As a result, T'challa is easily one of the most thought out/designed heroes currently in the MCU and has so much depth after this one movie! On the other hand, Killmonger, is quite possibly the best villain in the MCU.Also have to mention: great supporting cast! The rest of the characters are so good that you are still entertained even when the previously mentioned characters are not on the screen.10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,"One of my best 2018 movies so far, the cast, the powerful acting,
i was afraid of not liking the movies and i didn't want to be called racist but this movie is just too refreshing, wakanda!!wa-kan-da!!
PS, no DC movie can compete to this or any other marvel movie
DC movies are crap , wonderwoman sh*t, justice league sh*t, came out to early poor acting just saying"
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,8/10,"I ended up watching this a few weeks after it came out so the hype had already come and went. I'm glad I waited because I would've been disappointed after the initial hype train. I ended up really liking the movie anyways, but it wasn't a 10 out of 10. Interesting sci-fi elements and really cool to see something that felt new. I would watch it again in theaters, which for me is the real mark or a good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2020,3/10,"It's a weak movie. It's too long, boring at times.
Being based on a comic book is a common handicap for Hollywood movies these days. Although it didn't stop Christopher Nolan from making some great films about a grown man in tights and with stupid rubber ears.
Let's face it: this movie brought so much money only because it was made a political statement. It was shoved down everyones throats as the first movie about a black superhero, made by black people. And it was a completely commercial move and actually hurt the officially declared cause. The only thing it proved is that black people can suck at making movies just as hard as white people do. Wait, maybe that was the point! Aha, than it was a win! Of sort... I guess...
Anyway, it should have made a point. It must have with all the hype. And the point apparently is that no matter how advanced is the technology africans get, their society is unable to evolve past primitive tribalism and monarchy.
Well, then the point is africans can achieve something important only when a magic meteor falls right on their heads, not on their own. 
Generally speaking, if you perceive the movie as a story that was supposed to tell us something about black people, and it was definitely advertised as such, the message you end up with is very bad.
Giving Oscars to a weak movie was clearly part of political censorship and just proves again the award has really nothing to do with a film's quality.
There are parts that I liked watching, like all bits with Andy Serkis. He would have made a great antagonist, but was retired too early. With him gone action loses appeal.
The civil war at the end is lame. There's no feeling Wakanda has advanced economy or military might. All you see is a couple of fliers and no heavy weaponry, lots of spears, though. The final battle looks like a brawl at a bar.
Ideological content is weak as well: they oscillate between isolationism or imperialism and at the end choose to come out and ""share"" technology. I wonder how would that work in modern economy.
Final verdict: weak, but it's always a pleasure to see Andy Serkis work."
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2018,1/10,"Well what more can i say that others haven't said already? Really painful to watch, the worst Marvel movie ever made. Acting was mediocre, plot was thin, cgi was terrible. Not worth the money. I am not sure why this is breaking all the Box Office records?"
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,6/10,"Better than I thought it was going to be, but we don't need a sequel."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,4/10,"Maybe because of the big hype I expected much more. The forces racism made it unwatchable at some moments, also it is pain to watch it without subs."
BLACK PANTHER,3 April 2018,9/10,"Would I recommend this to a friend? YAAAAAASSSS. It's filled with action, and it is SO GOOD to see people of colour being represented!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,7/10,"It took MCU a lot of time to introduce this super powered king, hope they won't waste this in the future.Moreover, there are good topics, great antagonist with reasonable motivation, and out standing female characters in this movie. It is clear that MCU is trying for something different and kind of succeed. Although they still have plenty of rooms for improvement, this is still an iconoclastic and desirable movie."
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,3/10,"Yea I said it, it's overrated as any other marvel movie out there. Some people are even tricked into thinking this is a Black Panther Movement movie Laugh out loud.
The plot is trash as usual, it's no real blockbuster at all. 
The only thing good about this movie is the Visuals and picture, I'll give it that."
BLACK PANTHER,1 February 2019,6/10,"I watched this as it has somehow been nominated for best film at the Oscars this year..and, for the life of me, i can not fathom any direction of minds that makes this any different or superior to any of the Marvel films. The story was slow and predictable and the action scenes of no great luster. I really found nothing imaginative or unique about this film. The academy needs to be taken out and put to pasture for nominating it. Sure watch it if you are a marvel fan but for me it was a painful two hours harrowed by tedium."
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,10/10,"I really enjoyed this movie, as it the first time Marvel debuted this character. For something new and fresh it was awesome and captivating. It was a pleasure to watch and I wait to see where it ranks at the end of this year among the other Marvel great films coming out..."
BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2018,7/10,Was a good movie. Saw it twice. There were some funny parts and some sad parts.
BLACK PANTHER,28 November 2018,1/10,"Awful dull boring film.
Really not sure what hype was about"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,7/10,"Rating this movie at 7.5.
Although the background, characters for he story are all reasonble and Marvel, the story itself doesnt quite fair.
I personally prefer the male 2. And his revenge shouldn't be ended in such a unfair tragedy. The leading role, who doesn't have clear personally characteristics in the movie, obviously is not more capable than male 2 for the throne. Anyway the whole story and the ending is very farfetched. There is no reason to be rated over 8 itself."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,5/10,Don't understand what all the hype was with this movie it was without a doubt the most highly overrated movie I've seen in a long time...special effects don't make for a good movie unfortunately Hollywood seems to think it does.
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,1/10,To say we were disappointed after all the hype is an understatement. It seems the mainstream are scared to be truthful about it. It had a lot of promise but was poorly executed. Don't waste your money on it.
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2018,7/10,I overall liked Black Panther. It's family friendly and has very likable characters.
BLACK PANTHER,27 September 2018,1/10,"Racist, boring, bad CGI, bad acting.
Everything is bad with Black Panther, i have lost 2 hours of my life watching this crap, is like Marvel payed critics to acclaim this."
BLACK PANTHER,28 October 2018,6/10,"Personally, I don't like this kind of movies because they repeat always the same plot. initially the plot seems to be equal to other movies (It means fight against villains and superheros), but in the middle of the Story, the plot completely changes due to an unexpected truth."
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2021,7/10,"I loved a country of Wakanda, the culture, world, scenery and people. I think it was well played, CGIs were very good and story but, I have to be critical about some things. -2 stars because of clique and predictability. If I haven't seen almost all Marvel movies I would give it more stars but they are going on every new hero with one script and they are repeating it over and over again. I know exactly what and when it will happen. -1 star for progressive propaganda and hypocrisy. Example: if Ross tell something about skin color in the move but he didn't meant to insult somebody it would be racist. When Shuri tell Ross ""Colonizer"" and she meant as insult, it is ok and no racist. When I saw that I was like ""Are you kidding me?"""
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2019,7/10,"People hyped up this movie so much for no reason. Fights were meh, main character is meh, pacing was ok, the only thing I really liked is the villain and his motivation."
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2019,8/10,A really fun Marvel movie that lives up to the hype. I am really happy to see an African American superhero on the big screen and even grabbed an Oscar for best costume design. The effects and visuals are spectacular especially while watching it on a flat screen TV in HD
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2019,7/10,"Enjoyed black panther more than I thought I would.Felt a bit all black cast that I actually didn't mind at all.Enjoyed that they showed africa beauty and etc but the movie has to much fuzz for nothing.Its like Thor movie based in Africa.Nothing really really different from the classic marvel pilot movie formula.Costumes and make up on point.
Scenery was perfect.
And for a change the villain had a purpose!!!!7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2019,1/10,This one is actually a depreciation of Africa and African. This is just telling you that even if Africans have all the things colonizers have you can't use it properly. Undeveloped features will still remain on Africans. You will still behave and fight like tribes. This is absolutely a kind of racism!
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,7/10,"This is an overrated movie without a doubt, but it's still a good and decent movie. Although I think the fight scenes are lacking in a bit of intensity especially the last one. The plot itself is decent. Villain is very good relatable and makes sense, amazing performance by Michael B Jordon. I think the main problem of this film was the fight scene as it's a superhero movie there's a level of expectation in its fight scenes so 7.5/10."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2019,10/10,Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever Wakanda for ever
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,2/10,"This movie lacked diversity and inclusion. It was all black people acting as black nationalists. Where were the asians? The Native Americans? The hispanics? This was a snoozer. Same tired comic book plots but FBBB, For Blacks By Blacks. Nothing inventive, nothing original, nothing worth watching, and obviously funded in part by the Department of Defense.Save your time, save your mind, save your life. Avoid Black Panther and everything connected to it."
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2019,9/10,"Great visuals, not very deep but sufficient story, has a lively African background that gives life to the movie,
It is not ""the best MCU movie"", but given its context and different world it does succeed to entertain.
It has a fresh and lively approach and cast, and that's why it is a fine blockbuster.
Ambitious movie and they made it, a good marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2019,10/10,I am SHOCKED . How can you give a one star . This is a great to MCU . Its not the best but a good film . I am not writing a review but countering Haters .
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2019,4/10,There is nothing special about this movie. The hype was too much and that made it a real letdown.
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,10/10,"Marvel, and Disney definitely delivered with Black Panther! The story was formulaic, and somewhat predictable, BUT freshened up by Marvel/Disney. The movie was well acted, and showed a different view, especially of Africa. There were a few missteps/goofs,, but they were so minor that the movie wasn't affected at all.(Ie: It has implied that Killmonger flew from Korea to Africa, in a small prop engine plane, without refueling, which can't be down with modern small prop planes(unless he used Vibranium.....hmmmm) and why go through the effort to rescue Klaue, just to kill him at the plane?) The naysayers either are doing anything/saying everything they can to take down the movie because of the majority black cast(and their hate is guiding them), or just totally miss the point/are too ignorant to understand."
BLACK PANTHER,8 February 2020,6/10,"Im gonna sound like a broken record here but the movie was honestly bad. It was way overhyped and overrated. The overall feel of the movie was good, I like that they made a movie that has a different feel/culture to it. The visuals were ok, but the very bad CGI fight at the end ruined it. To add to that everything felt forced, the jokes were just...I could tell they were trying to hard to appeal to the audience.This movie is kinda like a one time watch sorta deal with me. Like I said before, the movie is bad, however, the actors and actresses are amazing, yet it feels like the movie should've complimented them more.-RR"
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2020,4/10,"I like equality as much as the next man, but Hollywood is driving this too far. It seems they can't stop making excuses for not having enough movies with women, all races that aren't white and people with handicaps. Just watch one of the last Oscar shows, and you get what I mean. To me, this movie puts the black people even more in a corner, out of which they are trying to escape from for years. Let's give them an exaggerated accent (I didn't know Jamaica was an African country), big lips (with a saucer implanted in them), an ancient tribal culture and let the tribes fight among each other. Then make sure that, even though Wakanda is extremely rich and technologically advanced, the people in the kingdom are poor peasants. Now the acting. That was, in my opinion, some of the worst acting since all 300000 episodes of ""The Bold and the Beautiful"". I guess every colored person went to the movies because there finally was a black superhero, thus explaining the record breaking box office. They should all ask for a refund, for making ridicule of their race. The only thing missing to make things worse was the Black Panther smoking weed on his throne. What's next Marvel: which minority group are you pushing through our throats next."
BLACK PANTHER,29 November 2020,7/10,I don't like superhero movies but this one is good. Really liked Killmonger's backstory. Good acting. Good emotional moments. The message behind the movie is a bit primitive and naive but still admirable. Editing was okay. Africa is a very beautiful place and I don't get it how they messed up cinematography and just made mediocre shots. In the end I think T'Challa is what the world needs.
BLACK PANTHER,21 December 2020,10/10,"One of my favourite films with real rewatch value. Every time I watch it I see something else that reflects the craftsmanship of this movie. It features a wealth of interesting human connections, fun action scenes with genuine stakes and a heart rending conclussion. Themes from the real world are woven with emotional punch and with subtlety and nuance. You are not told what to think and different worldviews play out on the screen without too much meta comment. Watch with an open mind and readiness to laugh with glee and cry."
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2021,10/10,"The best hero movie of all time. This movie is simply incredible in all parts, music, scenery, direction, plot, even the dialogues are incredible. And being a black man I felt represented by the film, basically incredible."
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2021,9/10,"Black Panther is a wonderful and unique movie in almost every way. The acting performances behind the cast is stand-out, especially that of Chadwick Boseman and Micheal B. Jordan, and most of them are really likeable and understandable characters.Jordan really sells the character of a properly motivated villain and Boseman does so as the conflicted hero who decides there must be a change. Combine the great acting with the fantastic themes, cultural significance, story and fight scenes (and not so bad comedy either), and you have a movie that teaches a great lesson in the end while remaining entertaining throughout.The only things I can criticize are the half baked love stories and somewhat crappy CGI.I wanted to make this review because there are WAY too many unjust and negative user reviews on this site. I rewatched the movie after reading these reviews LOOKING for something to hate, and I could not find anything. If you have not already, watch the movie (if you can). People leaving low reviews on this site don't seem to understand a quality movie with complex and interesting themes and ideas."
BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2019,10/10,This movie is so much better than other superhero movies that I hesitate to call it part of the same genre. I loved it.
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2018,6/10,"Nearly everyone I know who saw this movie thought it was boring. I tend to agree. Glad I saw it, but unlike most other Marvel movies, I won't be buying this one. Wouldn't care if I never saw it again. Special Effects are mixed-the fight scene with Killmonger is so obviously a set that it's cringy.If you want to see a movie that makes you feel deep empathy for black people, watch Hidden Figures or The Help. Vastly superior movies in every way to Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2018,5/10,"I almost never write reviews. But this time I feel the need to say something.
My girlfriend and I will watch mostly any kind of movie. We have also watched all the Marvel movies up to this one. There were good ones, some were ok and a few really bad. But I never felt the need to say to my girlfriend ""I'm sorry I made you watch this"" until last night. She didn't think it was necessary, she knew that I had suffered through this at least as much as her. But let's pick this one apart just for a few words:Scenario - plot: Ok.. I think I started with the lowest point. It was completely non-existent, nonsense and boring. Not much to write here, I think I already half-forgot what the movie was about but I distinctly remember the taste and feel of it (unfortunately).Characters: If we're talking about cliched, flat 2-dimensional characters that are extremely predicable while at the same time being unrealistic, this should be a prime example. All Marvel movies flirt with this problem, but at least you care for the characters you're watching. In this one, I was going from total indifference to hate and back.Effects - CGI: Aren't they supposed to get better by year? Was this shot 10 years ago? The underground scenes were horrible and the above-ground scenes were nauseating.Acting: Here it's mixed. I can see the genuine efforts by many actors but I think the directing kinda mutes most of those peaks into rather bland outcomes. The protagonist especially has no emotion, no feel and no credibility in the way he portrays the main character. A different accent (one that comes and goes in many levels, often jarring) is not enough to make it real.Continuity - world: I don't see many reviewers mention this one but viewers need a very high level of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. I will talk vaguely to avoid any spoilers. The whole story behind ""technological advancement"" based on a specific element is bonkers from the start but they creators don't even make an effort to disguise it some. In reality, progression of science to higher levels requires so much collective effort, resources and communication that even advanced countries it appears to be a crawling process. Here, yeah right, you guessed it, the exact opposite. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about and you're already felt your brain flushed through the drain. And I'm not even mentioning all their habits, clothes, items used. Holy **** just thinking about it makes me furious; the whole idea is so stupid it shouldn't exist and it shouldn't have been made in to a movie from the start!In conclusion, and after you've read and endured my rant, the real question is: Should you watch this movie? For those who have already done so and are just checking opinions, you know... what's done is done and you can't change it so if you didn't like the movie for any of the reasons mentioned above, congratulations, you have a good taste that matches mine (hehe) and we agree! For those thinking of watching this one? Well, let me tell you, it's a BAD movie, even compared to low Marvel standards and it will most likely make you frustrated and angry. It's also a redundant and needless movie, even for the Marvel Cinematic Universe... But, unfortunately, you WILL watch it, because like me you want your movies and stories in the proper order. And I don't blame you, because you should watch it actually! Bad movies should be watched now and then in order to make us understand what is bad and what is good, in order to appreciate the good and proper efforts even more. Yeah, so suffer it, just because of that! :D Cheers!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther was pretty great and it avoids most of the problems that plague many of Marvel's other movies. It has a unique story to tell and does the best it can to tell that story instead of wasting its time serving as a trailer for future Avengers movies. It uses humor wisely and does not kill several dramatic or intense scenes by throwing in a cheap joke. It lets the emotional moments sink in, and does not try to undercut them.The villain is a fully realized character with an understandable motivation, and he has personal ties to our hero. Great. We need more believable antagonists like this! In fact, pretty much all of the characters - even the supporting ones - were fleshed out and given time to shine. The worldbuilding was also well done and most people will leave the movie wishing they could go to the country of Wakanda. 8/10.Black Panther does not reach the heights of comic book masterpieces like The Dark Knight or Logan, but I'd say it's a cut above most of the superhero movies that came out last year, including Thor Ragnarok, Spider-man Homecoming, Wonder Woman, Gaurdians of Galaxy 2 and the horrid Justice League (hatethatmovie)."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,2/10,"With all the hype this should have been epic. Oh well, at least I never have to see it again and this is a legit see-it-only-once movie, unlike the movie 300 which I can watch over and over. This felt like a political movie more than entertainment. MEH!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2020,2/10,"This has to be one of the most hyped movies in the movie history.The acting and the scripts are so bad that it was embarrassing to watch the movie. The story is so boring that it was excruciating to endure the running time (I am not even sure if it had a story). The action sequences are so poorly done that it made Ultra Men (1960s Japanese movie for children) look good. For me, the gold standard for a bad movie is Sci-Fi Channel's Sharknado. To be fair, it is slightly better than Sharknado, but not so much better.It is apparent that Oscar and the Hollywood have succumbed to the political correctness. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2018,10/10,"Proud to review this great,great film!! I have seen all the racist One,Two and Three star reviewers and can't disagree more!! This film is more low tech than previous marvel films, but has a great start and tells a very involving story..Without giving the plot away this is a film that people were going more than once to see..Visually very scenic with great fight scenes..Avoid all the ""whiney"" reviews and see it for yourself!! Terrific!!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,10/10,"Black Panther, the movie, was brilliant. From the themes, to the story, to the CGI and the incredible costumes, sets and photography, it transported the viewer to a virtual feast! 
The theme of good vs evil is nuanced by the characters who are flawed and full of passion. The storyline is almost too true, because relatives are often the warring factions in the desire to rule. The hero, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), is both tempered and empowered by knowledge of history, diplomacy and the super-strength arising from a combination of an herb drink and the verbanium (bullet proof) suit. 
Each character is unique. M""Baku (Winston Duke) stood out with his arrogance and compassion; his strength and moral compass-a delightful break from the expectation of a villainous competitor for the throne. 
The genius Scientist sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), offers both technology to engender envy in James Bond and intelligent humor as a sibling sidekick. 
Michael B. Jordan's vulnerable and self-confident portrayal of the villain-relative with his viable grief and a passion to gain what he believed he was entitled to, offers the chance for a healing even in death. 
Okoye, played so well by Danai Gurira, she dominated every scene-drawing my eyes to follow her every action. Lithesome and sinewy with an athletic prowess any girl might crave, she makes the essence of womanhood desirable, and baldness alluring. Amazons, move over!
So many actors enriched the drama. So fun to actually see Andy Serkis (Ulysses Kaue) with a human face. Zuri (Forrest Whitaker) compels us to see both sides of honor and dishonor. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) brought a quiet strength to the future queen. Angela Bassett's queen mother, Ramonda, brings her understated elegance as a supportive mom to the role. 
The writers drew me into the story and made me want to visit Wakanda, with the rich colors and textures, technology balanced by logic and humanity. The struggle to share knowledge, when you know that some might turn things into war and destruction instead of building up families and traditions. 
As a WASP, I was glad to see that Martin Freeman's CIA character, Everett K. Ross, was welcomed ultimately, cuz I'd hate to be left out. Don't we all want to be a part of Wakonda?
Wakonda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2019,4/10,I saw this movie free so I suppose I shouldn't complain to much. It was a madhouse just getting into the theater and I didn't understand the applauding by the audience. I will be criticized for this post but I simply don't care. The movie was way overhyped and I simply did not understand the Oscar nomination.
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,1/10,"The many effusive reviews for this film make me wonder whether the review system is another instance of Payola. This movie would need HUGE work to be regarded as mediocre. It is slow, dull, cliched, boring. The cinema sales figures don't support a movie that is truly popular. If you haven't seen it yet - don't bother."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,10/10,"This movie was fantastic! There is an awful lot of hate in some of these reviews...and we all know exactly why. It was beautifully shot and superbly acted with a wonderful plot and well written storyline. Ranking among the best movies I've ever seen, definitely the best Marvel movie, and without question the best superhero movie. This sets a standard, like Deadpool, Winter Soldier, and the Dark Knight series, but easily surpasses them. Definitely a contender for next award season.You can't call yourself a fan of Black Panther, Marvel, comic book movies, fantasy, or movies in general, and hate on this one. What Coogler and company did here is truly special. And to only be his third film? Well deserving of the budget. So, let me try to do this with no spoilers...T'Challa/Black Panther is the king of Wakanda, a landlocked country, hidden from the world, located in Southeast Africa. It boasts the most technologically advanced society on the planet, yet still maintains its traditionalist culture. For those surprised, even angered (triggered) by the fact that a movie based in Africa, about a country that has never been colonized, boasts a virtually all Black cast....duh! Really? What did you expect? Applying various aspects borrowed from many very real cultures and societies from across the continent helped to bring this masterpiece to life and connect to not only those who felt they've been largely ignored, those of African decent, but it also seemed to resonate well with people across the globe. This is a worldwide cultural phenomenon. The rapid success at the box office testifies to this fact. Truth be told, even the amount of hate it continue receive just goes to show how powerful and positive this movie is. There are actual campaigns designed to bring it down...futilely, but these efforts do exist.Each character played his or her part very well in this play. Each represents a portion of they global African diasporal mindset. From T'Challa, to Killmonger, to Nakia, M'Baku, Okoye, Shuri, and beyond...each showing that Black people abroad are not a monolith. That although we may have differing ideas, philosophies, languages, cultures, etc., we can still form a fully functional society, contrary to what's been shown in the past -or even what continues to be shown today. It also asks the question ""what would Africa, and the world, be without colonialism, European imperialism, and interference?""If you view each character as a representation of a philosophy, it takes on a totally new and exciting perspective. Traditionalism vs modernism, globalism vs isolationism, loyalty vs ambition, sins of the father vs self atonement and forgiveness...I could go on, and on, but what it does not trod out are the tired old tropes; men vs women, all evil vs all good (there's really no such thing anymore), etc. There's no deranged bad guy trying to take over the world just because he's bored, or destroy it because he didn't get pancakes. These characters are 100% human and relatable. They're flawed, opinionated, funny, brilliant, brave, and true to themselves. They love, they fear, the get angry, they hurt, they laugh...what more can you ask for? And for those who have a problem because they're Black despite the very obvious fact that they're African), just pretend they're white...like Hollywood has been doing since it's inception. Or you can just get over it."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,4/10,"I have never written a review before, but after reading so many conflicting reviews i had to see this to make my own mind up. I went expecting a different more intelligent Marvel but found myself almost laughing when it tried to be serious and crying when the action sequences were so underwhelming. The whole experience was disappointing, and i soooo wanted to to like it. In a nutshell the first 20 mins was good the middle hour was boring, i looked at my watch and even thought could i be bothered to stay to the end, but i did, and the last 20 mins was ok."
BLACK PANTHER,26 January 2019,1/10,"Story was underwhelming at best. Felt really boring and not very creative. Dialects were extremely hard to understand...film actually needed english subtitles, which would have been ridiculous.
This just goes to show what a joke the members voting on films for the Oscars are. I would like my 2+ hours wasted back from watching this in the theater, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over with....it's a rental at best and should never be a best picture nominee."
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2018,2/10,"Almost no redeeming qualities, plus killing off the most interesting character halfway through the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,1/10,"Incredibly naive, boring and completely lacking of humour. The absence of fun is it's main problem. I cannot avoid thinking that the high critic score's reason lies in the fact that nobody would dare sinking a 99% afroamerican movie. What a ridicolous time we are living in. What a pointless movie and character. Not the worst but certainly among them."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,1/10,"I have never not liked a superhero movie that came from Marvel or DC Comics, until Black Panther! IMBD gave it a 7.8/10, Rotten Tomatoes a 97%, and Metacritic an 88%! Their showing must've had all the fabulous scenes and storyline that was obviously edited out. I appreciate and enjoy the 3 act structure of the set-up, confrontation, and resolution that the screenwriters and directors use to seamlessly keep these movies action packed, exciting, humorous, emotionally gripping, and thought provoking. None of this was done effectively with Black Panther. I hate to say this but it seemed as if the director, Ryan Coogler was trying to make this movie relative to the struggles of black communities living together in inner-cities. I could be totally in left field with that thought but it just seemed too coincidental. Albeit fine, and if that was his objective, superhero films that are based on the action, adventure, and sci-fi genre don't flow seamlessly, or well, with a film that seems steeped in the drama genre. It was a disappointingly abysmal let down. How this movie got rave reviews by movie critics across the board is mind boggling but in this day and age when you can lose your job, followers, advertising deals by being forthright, unflattering, and God forbid curt and negatively critiquing a film that is made up of 98% African American Actors, Director, and Writers you will unequivocally get torn apart by the news media, social media, and probably ANTIFA! Especially, when you're the only movie critic who mistakenly did his job. I can just imagine them all sitting at their desks after watching Black Panther thinking, ""That movie was utterly horrible, but I can't write that now can I? I'll be made to look like a movie critic version of President Trump, except without the power, billions in net worth, and powerful allies, they'll destroy me! Just lie for God's sake, forget my integrity, moral fortitude, and pride! I'll die if I have to do manual labor!!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 December 2018,1/10,"Veak actors, boring hero and villain. Little action and too much talk. Way overrated."
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,10/10,"This is definitely one of the greatest Marvel films by far with an engaging plot, a compelling villain and an important message. Black Panther's monumental success at the box office is certainly evidence that this film crosses many boundaries and touches people in a fundamental way. While the film delivers the expected action, moments and humor seen in all the Marvel movies it also speaks to historic problems in the United States and the world. Certainly the race and poverty message is a poignant one and resonates with not only African Americans but also any historically exploited or oppressed people.
It is interesting to note how some Caucasian Americans have reacted to Black Panther over some other Marvel films. Some white people that I have encountered (especially the overly-sensitive Trump supporters) seem to be insulted by the racial overtones of this film and cannot possible separate those notions from the rest of the film's quality. It is important to note that among the prior criticisms here on IMDB you will see many ""I'm not racist but"" comments or at least claims at not noticing the race of the actors. As we see in the age of dog whistles to white supremacists these claims are typical of such people. 
It is very sad to be living in a time when people cannot separate their own political biases from judging quality artwork. Black Panther is an exemplary piece of entertainment just like most of the Marvel movie franchise entries and no doubt that the inclusion of an almost all African American cast made the film more attractive to a worldwide audience. It is obvious that some weak minded viewers simply cannot stand it when minorities gain great success weather it is in attaining the highest office in America or making block buster films. In the end, the overwhelming evidence by multiple sources prove Black Panther to be a great movie but it's detractors who are racially motivated really aren't interested in truth backed by objectivity; they only want to see their own frailty supported by hate filled opinion."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,"Saw the trailer, wasn't too impressed, then the hype from all around got to me and bought a ticket online for afternoon show in a new theater with recliner seats. Rushed over there to make it on time, sat through no lease than 30 minutes of movie commercials and the the movie started. Looked very promising but only for the first 10 minutes then got very weird very fast. Anyway watch it since you are curious but in my opinion, first 40 minutes or so super stupid and boring. Gets much better after the fight between bp and the American black dude. Too many coming back to life, all African dialects mishmash, too much dependency on cgi etc. the Korean car chases were so bad and poorly executed. I don't think if people see others dying and drenched in blood that they will gather around to take pics, rather than Callander by for help, running away etc. super immature execution esp in the beginning. Btw I am neither black or white person"
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,9/10,"Movies are not just conveyers of entertainment but of values and this is one of the good ones. In keeping with the Marvel universe the values of heritage, family, and honor are all done well. Clich√©..., perhaps, but I prefer to say that tradition trumps non-conformity much of the time and that it is good to be reminded that ancestry, ritual and doing the right thing are compatible. I love that Andy Serkis plays a prominent role. He is a man with a million faces, a fine actor and a worthy heir to Lon Chaney Jr. and much more."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"After seeing Black Panther in Civil War I was so excited for this movie. However in this, I was left disappointed to a dull plot, long and mostly boring movie I was uninterested throughout most of it. Chadwick Boseman did do a great job I am a fan. But overall the fight scenes were mediocore, in one fight Black Panther is just throwing punches with his opponent like a boxing match and they're both slow. I had imagined him being a lot faster and stronger than he is portrayed in this film. And as for the movie's humor, it's not bad just not my taste. It has some funny moments."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Predictable.... yea, but it was ok. Not the best thing i've seen, not the worst. But good enough to have on my shelf at home"
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"In all honesty. What were the writers thinking? The movie is so bad,it's a straight to DVD B type production movie. I literally thought to strap myself to the chair to watch this after 10 minutes. To me this movie felt like an insult to Africa and African people! Fake accents everywhere. Even Koreans they couldn't get right, was it that hard to find a few people? Even people with no acting skills could do better, just so poorly researched. Busan felt like a copy paste CGI. I'm not sure what's the Panther's purpose? I felt no connection to any characters whatsoever. Critics should be ashamed of themselves calling this a masterpiece. Probably they felt pressured to dish out a nice review, if not, the backlash from black communities would be huge and they would be labeled racists? It's just a bad movie, maybe worst by Marvel. I felt robbed after watching and my eyes are still sore. If you want a real BLACK superhero, then watch my all time favorite BLADE. Leave this movie to kids, a I'm pretty sure even they wouldn't enjoy it. I wish I could give it a 0. IMDB, you're probably rigged as well. Reviews here are not a merit anymore. Who knows probably infested with bots?"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"Most of the MARVEL movies are able to tell the story and not let the story telling bog the movie down. This one seemed to suffer a bit from that. I had to check my watch a few times. It did not help that the plot was very predictable. When your on a long straight road and you can see 5 miles ahead of you...
The effect were great, acting was good (I really like Boseman / Makes a Great King -Panther ). There is some comedy sprinkled in here and there which helped break a bit of the monotony. The climatic ending did not seem that climatic to me. (Kept thinking so what, their is a whole group of AVENGERS out there if Black Panther fails, big deal)
I watch the other Marvel flicks over again and again, not sure I will be watching this one again"
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,1/10,"Logic? Motivation? Any connection to a real world human behavior? No! I can characterize this movie as a mix of cliches, nonsense and crystal meth.
Don't even get me started about all this pseudo sci-fi garbage Marvell puts into their movies these days. But let's rather talk about story and characters. The whole conflict in this story is created out of nothing for the sake of having a conflict. Without this conflict the story is absolutely empty. I wasn't able to watch this movie without facepalming every 5min over another ""unexpected twist"" or stupid dialogue. Characters are incredibly dull with no personality or real motivation. It's that black guy, this black guy and those black women. And don't get me wrong, I'm no racist, I'm talking about characters. The villain is evil and angry at the whole world for no damn reason whatsoever and his appearance is a freaking joke. The protagonist is an impotent, not worthy to be a king. Supposedly he was trained for this task his whole life, but when his time came, he end up being weak in both body and soul. The leader supposed to command respect, but how someone with no balls to do what must be done can command respect is beyond my understanding. The whole their city, or whatever it is, looks something Snoop Dogg, or whatever his name currently is, would have built after smoking too much weeds. The whole this ""super-advanced society right under everyone's noses"" thing is laughable on it's own. Even special effects are lame at certain points, but even those, that are not, are totally incapable of saving this catastrophe. We are so used to special effects, they no longer look like something special and capable of carrying he whole damn movie. Almost forgot about boss fights. You know why? They are so lame, you will never be able to recall them the next day after watching this."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,4/10,"What a mess and such a missed opportunity. Should have been a celebration of African culture instead its just pudding! It's not the actors fault more the story, script and director. As I watched it, and I gave up, I just kept thinking there is something wrong about the feel of the movie. Might be worth a watch on a very wet evening when there is nothing better to do, but maybe no there are better ways to waist your time"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2021,4/10,"A surprisingly monotonous, unambitious, and boring film, even by Marvel standards. Less of a review, here are some random thoughts which I had while watching this movie which is only notable for being the first all-black production from the current iteration of Marvel Studios.This film has an overflowing abundance of tell-don't-show exposition, which breaks the #1 rule of filmmaking: Show-don't-tell. For at least the first 30 minutes I had no idea what motivates the main character, what the previous king was like, what their relationship was like, or why I should care about anyone on screen except for their being the main characters in a Marvel movie.The main character's first self-directed act of the film was to jump into the middle of the jungle, murder a bunch of conscripted child soldiers (!!!), and knowingly ruin an undercover investigation into human trafficking (I think..maybe? It's not clear). He did this so that he could invite his girlfriend to a party the next day (???). I actually laughed out loud--for the only time in the film--when he said this. Is this man a psychopath?The film is introducing a completely new nation--apparently the most advanced on the planet--and all that the audience is shown of it is 2 or 3 largely empty rooms. They really brought the Imagineers to bear in creating this new world, didn't they? This grand nation of Wakanda feels extremely small and unimportant.The most advanced nation on Earth--with many terrible weapons of mass destruction on hand--chooses its leaders by seeing who can beat the crap out of each other the hardest? What the hell?!?! Actually.. that seems about standard by Marvel logic.The main character is told (not shown) that he will have a difficult time as king because he has a kind heart. At this point in the film his kindest action seems to have been in killing child soldiers.. His first morally conflicted kind act does not seem to happen until over an hour into the runtime and it has no ill effects whatsoever--in fact, it helps him! Great follow-up on that plot point, ey?The entire first hour of the film is wasted time and does not effectively develop any of the characters to a point which other films would manage to accomplish in 10 minutes. They run around furiously, accomplishing nothing. I did not feel that I knew any of the main characters any better at the end of the film than I did at the beginning, except for perhaps the villian--he had a bit of development.The visual effects would look right at home in a PlayStation 2 video game cutscene. Very unimpressive, very muddy, poor color contrast.. honestly, a mess.This movie was probably supposed to release before Captain America: Civil War, I'm guessing? Because at least then I would have had some idea of what was going on with this random panther man who showed up out of nowhere. Well... that's 2 incredibly boring movies that this guy is in, anyway.This film has some of the most eye-roll inducing and unfunny Marvel-style humor break-ins that I have yet seen. Even a bad film can be somewhat enjoyable if it takes itself seriously. But we can't do that in the Marvel universe, not ever. ""Come on guys, are you done with the serious faces?"" Wacky! Wacky!I was watching all-black superhero movies when I was 8 years old, and they were a lot more fun. Can I get some love for The Meteor Man? Maybe we could follow it up with a Static Shock marathon? Good times!"
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2018,7/10,Black Panther is a good movie that's worth your time. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan are great in their roles as King T'Chala/Black Panther and Erik Killmonger respectively. The supporting cast also does a pretty good job and I personally enjoyed Leticia Wright as Shuri and Winston Duke as M'Baku/White Ape. This is an action packed movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (and you shouldn't either). The CG is far from perfect and downright bad in certain scenes. This movie is also like most comic book movies where the story is pretty predictable with only a few twists. So is it perfect? No. Is it the worst movie ever that deserves only 1-3 stars? No. It's defonately a little overrated but it's still a fun movie. Go in with an open mind and you'll probably enjoy it. It's definately not the worst way to waste a few hours.
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,1/10,"What a pile of garbage, almost walked out.Worst film I've seen for a long time!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Such an amazing action packed film. The plot and characters were fantastic and the acting was top notch by all. No spoilers here, just see this movie if you haven't."
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2018,2/10,"This really is such a poor movie, like a pastiche of a bad superhero movie from the 80s or 90s. If it was made for children, then perhaps most off that is forgivable. But this is not a movie for intelligent adults."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"There are many one and two star reviews of ""Black Panther"" here on IMDB, and from reading them one must surmise that the reviewers have not seen the movie, but have a political agenda to forward. Because this is without a doubt the best Marvel Universe movie yet...filled with incredible action, writing, acting, CGI and a strong message of hope for not just the African-American community but for all Americans, and all citizens of the world. I strongly recommend this movie, and congratulate everyone who participated in its making. Lastly...and this is not a spoiler...but do NOT leave the theater when the credits begin to roll. There are two important scenes that you don't want to miss!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2021,5/10,Film was boring crap story bad actors... would rather watch Wandavision episodes 1 to 3 again...
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"It's really unfortunate that some people can't seem to leave their biases at the door and review this movie for what it is. Black Panther is a fantastic movie - action packed, entertaining, engrossing, exciting - truly what an action movie experience should be. I think the critics' reviews are right on the money with this one. Some claim it is political - really? I hope they had the same complaint about Wonder Woman since she fought Nazis in that film. I thoroughly enjoyed Black Panther and can hardly wait to see it again on the big screen."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,8/10,"I'm seeing a lot of really bad reviews here and I want people to know they're unfounded. Yes, it's true it wasn't marvel's finest hour but it was far from bad. Personally, I can relate to the criticism, some of the complaints were true but their severity is greatly exaggerated. Yes it was a little dry at times, yes the characters could have been better defined but these are hardly fatal flaws. I heard someone say it was far fetched....if we're gonna go that route stay away from Marvel all together these are stores about characters with unbelievable abilities that's what they've always been. So anyone who believes it far fetched I ask do you believe in super soldier serum? You really think people get pissed and turn green?? You think Dr Strange really travels the multiverse with magic??? Cmon guys, far fetched is unfair. Also for those who think it far fetched and criticize the believability keep in mind ALL of these story plots had been formulated LONG before these movies. The characters and abilities and origin stories are all taken DIRECTLY from the Marvel books of the past, it's not like someone made this story up last week. Every character and origin story is only telling you what the book said, the specific mission or adventure is fabricated but all characters abilities and origins come from Stan Lee so I don't wanna hear that this story was fantastical nonsense unlike other marvel movies. It's a good movie, not perfect, but I had to stick up for the movie after reading all these terrible reviews. Movie goers will enjoy this movie don't listen to the complaints"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2019,2/10,"The humanity must be crazy. This movie is a silly joke, ridiculous. and near of terrible reality of Africa should be watched as offensive."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Don't compare it to an Avengers/Civil War movie, there isn't more heroes than the Black Panther. And it's great first movie, they explain a lot and we get to know Wakanda and its people.
Don't know why some people react negatively on the villain because he was great, he was someone who lost his father att a young age and thrived only to have revenge(psycho).
If you only want action than wait for Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,"The movie wasnt bad, it wasnt a 1 but it most definitely was not a 10 as many on here are giving it. The pacing was generally good but it did seem to jump around trying to be a mix of 007, MI, marvel film, cooger film, etc. Id give it a 6 or 7 out of ten. Not a perfect ten, technical aspects suffered at times, mood changed which was wierd, the plot was good and it rolled along well."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"First of all let me tell you this: DO NOT believe the people who say this movie is bad ok?
 You can clearly see in these reviews that the most recent are the ones that qualify the movie as being great (8-10 stars) and almost every older review says the movie is crap. 
Why you ask? Because the older ones are from people who hadn¬¥t even seen the movie and were just trying to harm its reputation (you can see this because this movie¬¥s score on IMDb started out as 6,7 stars a week ago and is currently at 7,7)Moving on... This movie is a visual masterpiece and, in my opinion, is one of the 3/5 best Marvel movies because:A - Like I said, the movie is technically perfect and everyone agrees on that... The wakandian costumes are beautifully crafted, the set pieces are amazing, the special effects are on point at all times and the sounstrack... its just perefct in every single moment (kudos to Kendrick Lamar btw)
Examples: The last fight sequence with the rhinos, all fight sequences with the dora milaje, the korea car chase, etc...B - A lot of people said the acting is bad... FALSE... the acting is as good as it gets in a Marvel movie... Not oscar-worthy of course... but I think Angela Basset and Letitia Wright (Black Panther¬¥s mom and sister, respectively) delivered top notch performancesC - People also said the story is not original and it¬¥s predictable... Look, of course it¬¥s not amazingly original... But hardly any movie¬¥s plot in present time is... However, the story is captivating and well told and it really doesn¬¥t matter a lot in a Marvel movie if the story is really original as long as it¬¥s well executed and allows the viewer to understand the film¬¥s context (which it does in this case)D - The villain isn¬¥t good? Give me a break! This is basically Marvel¬¥s best villain yet (alongside witth Loki)... Good backstory, charismatic and not just another bad guy with lots of guns but someone who actually holds political significance in his plan, like a real villain shouldE - People saying the movie was overhyped and because of that critics aren¬¥t giving their honest opinions... Man this allegations are so stupid and clich√©... Critics give their honest opinions, wether you agree with them or not... You know another overhyped movie that critics bashed nonetheless? Suicide Squad! And man was I looking forward to that mess...
Now don¬¥t begin with the whole ""critics always support Marvel and hate on DC"" talk ok? Critics rightfully loved Wonder Woman because it was good, not because they were paid to...And they did the exact same with this glorious Marvel achievement! Please see this one. Ignore the pointless haters, because this one is quite something..."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,8/10,I would say this movie falls below the Marvels average. But keep in mind that their average is actually a pretty high standard.
BLACK PANTHER,10 September 2018,8/10,"I love the high tech things around. It is not the common things that we can see at usual. The fight scenes are super big enough. Anyway, I love this."
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2018,2/10,"One of the worst movies ever. Im all for the black cause & black pride but this movie lacks on every parameter may it be direction, story line, choreography, screenplay or dialogues. someday people will laugh at it as i am doing now. couldn't finish the movie in 3 sittings. too boring."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"First, it's important to remember that this, like all comic book to screen films, is derived from material that is made to appeal to the intellect of a 14 year old so the plot lines will not help anyone's quest to understanding the meaning of life (its just a movie folks!). The historically significant and ground breaking fact that it has a (nearly) all black cast and the impact that will have on the audiences, Hollywood producers and the earning potential of non-white actors going forward is noteworthy. Basically, it is a well crafted film with generous amounts of humor and suspense sprinkled throughout and, peeking at some of the reviews here before seeing it for myself, I expected less but got much more. Its an entertaining two hour amusement park ride that I enjoyed very much."
BLACK PANTHER,24 May 2018,1/10,"This movie is terrible. CG Is complete crap, acting is just as bad and accents. W.T.F"
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,5/10,Very very poor was really excited to watch this movie. The trailers made it look awesome but one car scene chase was the only worthy action in the whole film. And Martin freeman's American accent wow it was bad.
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,8/10,"Browsing user reviews, I see many jaded Marvel aficionados were not impressed by this offering. I would guess most of them are relatively young white guys. Being a relatively old white Star Wars guy, never having read a Black Panther comic and having seen only one X-Men movie (I did read X-Men comix in their early days), I'm looking at Black Panther, the movie, from a very different perspective, one shaped by the Vietnam War and Civil Rights struggles, the long view historical context (e.g., 18th Century colonialism, the self-destruction of four empires in WW1 and the undoing of the remnants of European dominance following WW2, the Cold War, Vietnam, the fall of the USSR, the wrong-headed adventures of US neo-conservatives leading to a destabilized Middle East, and the rise of China as the next superpower), 20th Century rock, cinema and literature, etc. Having found the media hype intriguing, I approached Black Panther with an open mind, viewing it as a standalone expression of pop culture. I would imagine the negative reviewers who panned the film or damned it with faint praise, will view my review as way out of touch. No problem, bring it.From my vantage point, the film is a tour de force of fantasy action adventure and an audiovisual powerhouse. The costumes alone of the citizens of the small African kingdom of Wakanda are well worth the price of admission. The best of Star Wars has nothing on the special effects. The throbbing African rhythms alternating with hip hop beats and ranks of male and female warriors slamming their spears to the ground in unison keep the viewer in a prolonged state of excitement. The film features a full range of thrills- single combat between heroic African martial artists, armies clashing with primitive weaponry backed up by armored dragonfly air support and tank-like rhinos, high tech cars chasing a convoy of MRAP (mine resistant, ambush protected) SUVs and wreaking havoc on hapless civilian traffic through Seoul, South Korea, dramatic appearances of the superhero, Black Panther, in his transforming body suit that absorbs kinetic energy from various projectiles and channels it back toward criminal aggressors, ultra-high speed trains flashing along elevated tracks through the hidden, futuristic capital of Wakanda, to name a few. Reviewers who think some or all of this is ridiculous are forgetting something: magical realism.However, the most compelling aspect of Black Panther is the thought-provoking script, brilliantly manifested cinematically though it is. The premise of Black Panther, a hidden paradise of scientifically advanced black Africans disguised as a poor third world backwater in order to prevent everyone else on the planet from realizing what they have and disrupting their idyllic way of life, is an extremely ingenious flipping of the contemporary geo-political reality, i.e., a small set of advanced countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas fending off incursions from the masses of disadvantaged and resentful descendants of oppressed minority groups and colonial subjects who would like to enjoy the health, wealth and opportunities of their current and former masters. In the movie, some of the elite of Wakanda, including a king's brother, are anguished by the plight of their black cousins in Africa as well as the USA. These Wakandans believe their country should use its vast but secret power to intervene on behalf of the oppressed of the world and create a more just global order. The king, a conservative traditionalist, considers this a betrayal and puts a stop to his brother's plans, setting off a generational revenge cycle that threatens to upend Wakanda's idyllically detached society and set their devastating technological power against the ruling princes and oligarchs of the Earth. Unbeknownst to those complacent elites, their fate hangs in the balance as the sons of the old king and his brother face off to determine whether Wakanda will remain a wary but hidden observer of their abuses and machinations or a stalking jungle predator coming to devour them in their sleep. Perhaps many viewers of Black Panther who respond favorably will enjoy it for its dazzling surface of beauty, action and drama. I certainly did. Those who go a little deeper and consider the ironies and implications of the story it tells (for example, Wakanda's radical anti-immigration and isolationist policies vs. the social conscience of the antagonists), will find food for thought. Is the idealistic resolution of the core conflicts satisfying? You be the judge."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"I have been a fan of marvel since Iron Man, and in the later Marvel movies, it all had a funny touch, except this one. The serious side is a focus and i like it, because this are super heroes and putting a solid funny punchlines ruin the idea of being a leader or a hero. At the same time, the story was captivating. The build up with black panther was huge. I followed the story, feeling the characters fighting to glory. The hero recognize the mistake of the system and changed it to make it right. Without A list actors, this will still be a hit with full pack story line."
BLACK PANTHER,8 April 2019,1/10,"You should be ashamed of yourself. Acting is the second biggest problem of this movie (the first one is the story), i mean Michael b. jordan....realy...???? the way he acts is embarrassing, the ghetto boy,...?realy?? why???? And than never ending story of american ""diplomacy"" in middle east, THE BIGGEST GENOCID EVER MADE BY HUMAN RACE, and you keep selling it through all channels as peace interventions. shame shame shame.!!!!!!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,7/10,"Guys your low ratings are a pathetic attempt to smear what is truthfully a fantastic film. Every detail of this film is a fantastic celebration of African culture and perhaps that is lost on the majority of the reviewers here. The overall tone feels fresh: part detective thriller, part balls-to-the-wall action romp, Black Panther's pace had me on the edge of my seat. Truly a fantastic addition to the MCU and the most enjoyable in a long time. Believe the hype. The proof is in the black pudding."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"I read the other reviews and for the first time I am going to say judge for yourself. Go see it. If you are a comic book fan base your opinion on how close the story is to the comics but then judge all the other Marvel Universe movies based on the same standard. 
If you are a movie buff base your review of the cinematography and direction against movies of the same genre.
But if you are like me and just want to go the movie to enjoy a fun time with a powerful message please see it. 
It is a shame that in 2018 everything is viewed through stained cloudy glasses of prejudice. This movie took the high ground and highlighted themes that are common to all people. 
See it as a fan, see it as a movie lover but most importantly see it a human being who can enjoy a story from a different perspective. I loved it,"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,7/10,"What's it about?
Black Panther is the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - the eighteenth movie in this grand experiment in an expanded universe. Directed by Hollywood up-and-comer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), the story follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the titular Black Panther, as he ascends to the throne of Wakanda following the death of his father in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. But things become more complicated when enemies appear, revealing dark family secrets and throwing the nation into turmoil.
Much of the early part of the film is devoted largely to world-building; Wakanda is a place quite unlike any of the rest of the Marvel universe (or the real world, for that matter). Ostensibly a poor, backward African nation (of the sort often described by Western stereotypes), Wakanda is in reality a wealthy technologically-advanced nation thriving in secret due to a rich supply of vibranium fallen centuries past from a meteor. As it has developed in isolation, its technology is fairly dissimilar from even the comics-style depictions of Western technology, and its rich culture, drawn from many real-world African sources, necessitates an exposition-heavy first act. 
The conflict begins when Ulysses Klaue, played by a scenery-chewing Andy Serkis, steals, then attempts to sell a chunk of Wakandan vibranium, and escalates when Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), an associate of Klaue, attempts to seize the throne for himself. This plunges T'Challa and his entourage, including a charmingly out-of-his depth Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross, into a violent power struggle marked by betrayal, sacrifice, and difficult questions concerning power, race, and global geopolitical dynamics.
What works?
While Chadwick Boseman makes an excellent lead, capturing simultaneously the dignity of a king and the ferocity of the Black Panther, the character has since its comics debut in 1966 been best defined by his supporting cast and the world-building around him. Clearly the creative forces behind Black Panther-writer Joe Robert Cole and writer-director Ryan Coogler-understood this point because the supporting cast is excellent and the world-building is as rich and compelling as any put to film. Among the supporting characters it is difficult to choose a single standout, but Black Panther's irreverant tech-genius sister Shuri, played by breakout star Letitia Wright, is hilarious and memorable. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira too is incredibly compelling as the fierce Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, the elite squad of Wakandan women who serve as personal bodyguards to the king. Lupita Nyong'o is also quite good as T'Challa's friend and sometime love interest Nakia, while Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, John Kani, and several others do excellent work in smaller roles. One climactic scene in particular showcases several of the supporting actors at their best in a complex and engrossing emotional tableau, making the scene all the more powerful.
Michael B. Jordan's performance is also excellent as Killmonger. Deliberately written to be incongruous as compared to the reserved, dignified Wakandan characters, he embraces the challenge while not ever going overboard (something that unfortunately cannot be said for co-villain actor Andy Serkis). The character himself is good, combing powerful motivations with a compelling and threatening on-screen presence. 
The world-building too is extremely compelling. Wakanda's culture is fleshed out enough that the viewer gets a sense of the rich, deep history defining the nation, and much of the technology is unique and interesting, though occasionally straying too far into comic-book unreality, testing the limits of suspension of disbelief. But the visual landscape of the Wakandan world is intricately designed and incredibly beautiful, and this reviewer for one expects it to garner some well-deserved Oscar attention in the Costume Design, Production Design, and Makeup and Hairstyling categories come next winter. 
Ludwig G√∂ransson's (Get Out, Creed) score is also rich and detailed, largely combining elements of both typical (though beautiful) Hollywood orchestral writing with the vibrant soundscape of traditional African song and drums, though it also incorporates hip-hop elements to great effect, as well as the occasional out-and-out pop or rap song. Between this and last year's Thor: Ragnarok, it seems that Marvel has recognized an oft-leveled criticism that its films' music is typically mediocre orchestral or electronic fare, and allowed its composers to express more individuality and build much more interesting scores (this is the first time I can recall coming out of a Marvel movie humming one of the themes). 
It would be horribly remiss to praise this film without acknowledging Ryan Coogler's superb direction. He showed with Creed that he could stage and orchestrate a fight scene as well as anyone in Hollywood, and with Black Panther he only proved that Creed was no fluke. One beautiful early fight is done mostly in long, smooth takes reminiscent of the one-shot fight from Creed, while a later one is broken and choppy (though always entirely comprehensible) in a way that helps simulate the emotional tone of the scene. The lone car chase in the film too is strong, though occasionally almost tentative, not milking its most exciting ideas for all they could be worth.
But Coogler's action directing is not the only technical aspect worthy of praise. He and cinematographer Rachel Morrison use a camera like Joshua Bell uses a violin-with a deep understanding of the content at play and a laser-like focus on communicating it to the viewer in the most powerful, visually exciting way. Marvel has had good success in the past with lesser-known directors like the Russo brothers, but with Coogler's success here and Taika Waititi's excellent work on Thor: Ragnarok, it seems like Marvel may be changing its modus operandi somewhat and allowing more-established directors to make films with more of their personal style, and it seems like an effective formula.
What doesn't?
Unfortunately, one of the greatest strengths of Black Panther-its rich supporting cast and deep world-building-is ultimately the consequence of one of its greatest downfalls; too many ideas are present for one two-hour film, and some have to suffer for it. The attention to detail devoted to the world of Wakanda and to the characters who populate it comes at the cost of a promising but ultimately flawed villain in Killmonger. Without giving away too much, Killmonger's motivations need a fair amount of exposition and development, plus a well-established, unified, ideologically-developed Wakanda. The latter is largely done, but the former is somewhat lacking. Perhaps the filmmakers would have been better served by saving the Killmonger story for a sequel-Klaue is the original main villain from the Black Panther comics, and would have served perfectly well as a villain for the standalone movie, especially with his role as a directly-opposed outsider reinforcing Wakanda's unity and isolationism, common themes from the comics. Then, with an already-built Wakanda, it would have been much easier to create a deeper thematic challenge with Killmonger. Combining all of the world-building plus two villains leads to an overstuffed plot which ultimately hinders the power of Killmonger as his own villain, though it does also result in a few excellent moments.
Some of the other characters and threads also suffer from this plot density. Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi in particular stands out as a wasted opportunity. Kaluuya has been proving the past few years that he deserves more attention as an actor, and his limited screen time and underdeveloped character are disappointing. Nakia and T'Challa's relationship too is perhaps somewhat underdeveloped when it deserved more.
The humor too is lacking. While the serious tone is a refreshing change after a year of humorous MCU entries, the attempts to interject jokes and humorous moments fall flat far too often; Klaue is much less funny than the writers seemed to think he would be, and there are a couple of jokes which fall depressingly flat-a ""What are thoooose?!"" joke feels dated already and the awkward way in which it's included in the scene feels uncomfortably forced. There are some good humorous moments-Winston Duke's M'Baku stands out in a few funny moments-but overall the humor does little to help the film as a whole.
But is it any good?
Yes! Marvel has a great track record, especially over the past couple years, and Black Panther is an entirely worthy addition to the MCU canon. As a film, it is probably not among the highest echelon of superhero movies, but its flaws do not prevent it from being a well-made, entertaining, and thematically-serious movie. It stands on its own too, and there's certainly no need for a potential viewer to have been caught up on the MCU, so if you like a good superhero movie, good action movie, or good movie in general, this will be right up your alley.
But the merits of Black Panther do not lie only in its successes as a film. Its cultural impact too deserves mention. Between Creed, Moonlight, and Get Out Hollywood has had a strong run of success the past few years from black writers, directors, and actors, and Black Panther represents a breaking-out of this trend into the mainstream. As of this writing, Black Panther has had one of the best Thursday previews of all time, and word-of-mouth certainly seems likely to help rather than hurt it, so it should go on to make a lot of money and good attention for Marvel. It seems that black filmmaking talent is finally coming into its own in Hollywood, and Black Panther should only serve to further this trend.
So all-in-all, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a successful, if imperfect, standalone movie."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,9/10,I'm just going to say this movie was more than I expected. I saw it a second time in 3d.
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2019,6/10,"But history never made them reveal their faces.
Why should I write this review so long..."
BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2019,7/10,"Black Panther provided us some background on the titular character that first showed up in Captain America: Civil war. It is certainly a welcome addition to the MCU and a decent film in it's own right. But it won't be remembered as one of the highlights of the series. The acting was great and I liked how they incorporated looks from different African cultures for the different tribes of Wakanda. Is it a must see film if you're watching the MCU films? No, I don't think it's essential. But it's a fun spin-off. The story wasn't incredible or anything and the villain Killmonger was perhaps a bit underwhelming (although I liked Jordan's performance, Killmonger simply isn't a Venom, Green Goblin or Magneto). All in all a good film, perhaps undeserving of the early hype but certainly not deserving of some of the extreme criticisms."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,5/10,"When you review a movie you need to get ""MARVEL"" factor out of the equation. If you are a fan of Marvel you are trying to ignore the cons of the movie always. I am not a fan of MARVEL or DC nonsense but a fan of Movies. According to my experience there are better movies with lower ratings out there. When I am started watching this I I had only one feeling. ""How much time I have to watch this!!"". I couldn't see any visuals properly in this movie. Just Dark environment with sets of dialogues. These types of movies always overrated due to Marvel FanBase. If going to watch this movie, please bring a pillow. If you are a hardcore marvel fan this movie will be OK to you. I am giving only 5 stars from 10 because I got bored halfaway watching the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,3/10,"I thought it had a decent story and stunning visuals, the African elements were refreshing and creative. However, the political message is too glaring and forced, like a product placement. Also, coming from a country composed mainly of immigrants, the ""greatness only achieved via isolationism"" theme and the majority of media's praise of the movie as significant specifically because it is ""(representation) for blacks, and (directed, delivered) by blacks"" are turn offs. For that a 3 might still be too high. Somebody treated me to this movie, left on my own I'd never have spent the money."
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2018,4/10,"The movie is clearly trying to present an alternative to the classic white male super-hero movies/characters. A very laudable idea, but the implementation is so bad that it has the opposite effect. Furthermore, it focus so much in the racial topic that at some points it is almost racist with continuous stereotypes about black people being in a given way. If the director would be a white person, I would sue him for some of the things in the movie (black people acting like monkeys, jokes of them eating people, etc.). In this sense, if someone is interested in good movies that present strong characters from African background I rather recommend ""Hidden Figures"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (sic.).That regarding the social topics that the movie was supposed to cover. But that's not all. The scrip is rubbish. After 5 minutes, one can imagine exactly what is going to happen. Most dialogues are such, that one knows the next sentence before the actor/actress has opened his/her mouth. The script is filled with cheap emotional sentences that seem taken from some fortune cookie. Most actors and actresses in the movie try to speak with some short of Nigerian/Kenyan accent and the outcome is ridiculous. The movie even managed to produce a ridiculous character played by Martin Freeman.The special effects of the movie are rather disappointing. Specially after movies like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and similar ones, I expected at least the minimum ""Marvel"" quality standards regarding special effects.The soundtrack was also rather disappointing. One good thing in the movie were some of the action scenes. The fighting choreographies are quite good. Also the car chases (surprise!) are pretty decent.Another good point about the movie, is that if you happen to watch it with a funny group of friends then you might have ""cheap jokes"" for a month. In this sense (too), the movie falls into the category of Sharknado.Watch at your own risk."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,5/10,"I'm a life-long Marvel fan but I'm probably not the right target market for this particular movie.I didn't enjoy it as much as the Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man Homecoming films."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,5/10,"The rave reviews were obviously given in the service of political correctness.This movie lacks the ""superhero"" fun, excitement, and sense of humor of other Marvel productions like the Iron Man, Avengers, Captain America, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man Homecoming (I include it as Marvel worked closely on it with Sony).I loved all previous Chad Boseman films and also loved Michael B. Jordan in Creed but I did not love this film.It was an OK superhero movie. It was not great."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"I kept wondering how the story about wakanda's super secret city & strength be revealed to the audience. And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed ""Nay"". You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it. Although it is a definite 1 time watcher, but one lacks the content of having watched a full-package Marvel movie simply because there just wasn't enough of everything.Black Panther a one time watcher if you are a Marvel's fan. Else the film will interest you only in parts.
IMBD's 7.6 as on date is almost justified, although i would give it a 7.1/10 in the long term."
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,2/10,"WELL i went to the theatres expecting it to be a good movie at least after the critics reviews i read and the ratings of some popular sites but what i witnessed was totally different the movie lacks every thing a decent story line overrated action scenes and it do not have any thing new to surprise the viewers or to get them excited believe me i am a marvel fan but this movie should be rated around 3 to max 5 stars .I don,t think it is a watchable movie for adults.I expected it to be like Thor ragnarok which was a fun movie in my opinion .CAN,T trust ratings any more."
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2018,1/10,One of the best characters in the MCU.. Black Panther was kool in Civil War.. What happened.. Wooden acting terrible plot.. Had to turn it off. Took 3 times to try and wade through this hard to watch film.. Love the Black Panther.. But not this film..
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"One of the biggest Jewels in the Marvel crown since Guardians of the Galaxy for different reasons. Speaks volumes on race, but looking beyond gender set roles etc. One of the best villains since Loki. I had a blast, beautifully presented with characters that are easy to invest and believe in. Great work."
BLACK PANTHER,18 September 2020,10/10,"This was one of the best marvel's i seen.
The loss of chadwick is a big blow to the movie world"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Looks like there are some folks trying to keep this movie down. (Russian Hackers? Fox News?) I doubt that much will come of this campaign. This film handles its business and leaves little doubt that it has. I'm not saying it's perfect but by super hero blockbuster standards, it definitely exceeds expectations. The writers/director (Coogler and Cole) have actually taken the time to write the actioner you want along with a fleshed out, exceedingly thoughtful and wonderfully relevant story, the likes of which have rarely graced this genre. This comic book myth may have been hatched in '62 alongside the emergence of the 'Black Panther' movement but this film announces that the social ideas and dreams, that were always that movement's subtext, remains alive. If you only know the 'Panthers' as a violent, revolutionary group, then you don't know the 'Black Panthers'. (I recommend the PBS documentary)Boswick is an excellent choice for T'Challa aka 'The Black Panther'. He's crafted an understated hero which suits his humility as great warrior and compassionate king. Michael B. Jordan aka 'Erik Killmonger' has come a long way since his days on The Wire and with good reason. He's truly become a wonderful, sensitive and intense actor which is on full display here. His portrayal is fully four dimensional having some ask whether he would have been a better Black Panther. Really, the entire cast goes all out to make this a human experience.Overall, the special effects are good with only a few over-the-top CGI moments and obligatory choreo-fights. This film isn't so much about the action (Don't worry. It's in there.) as it is about establishing the myth and proposing another way of seeing and being. AND the message isn't just for people of color.No spoilers today. Wouldn't want to undermine the experience in any way.8.5 stars!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 October 2018,7/10,"I suppose it's a fine film for the average movie-goer. It's got some terrific action; that trademark Marvel superhero comedy spice; and a surprisingly relatable and charismatic villain. 'Black Panther' fell short in other areas though - the acting in general was strange: rarely bad, but often stiff, forced, or very unconvincing, which became even more obvious when the dialogue was at its weakest. It would have served the movie better if the characters spoke in their native language, as it would have removed some of the stilted vibes from the dialogue. Beyond that, the CGI was generally hit-or-miss; Wakanda was disappointing from both a visual and logical standpoint, and many of the jokes were cringe-inducing. Michael B. Jordan deserves a special mention though for his amazingly magnetic performance as Killmonger."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"This is it. The last step. It should be clear for anybody, that so-called ""professional critics"", that are praising this movie as a masterpiece of sorts, a New Testament for a certain group of people, the best movie of all time are, in fact, fake. Maybe they were paid off, maybe afraid to tell the truth about ""first black superhero movie"" (also a fake - we remember Blade, and Blade is, indeed, a Marvel superhero) - but the results are devastating.Marketing guys decided to play the race card and they've collected the prize during the first weekend. But the long-running consequences for future Marvel films and ""professional reviewers"" will be far more worst - people will not buy their shit.This movie is ripped from Lion King along with dozen of other films (James Bond and Rocky Balboa, for e.g.), refreshed with bad CGI and questionable soundtrack. Really, the final battle looks like a shortcut scene from some mediocre video game - press X to win.Coogler done the impossible -T'Challa, along with his girlfriend, are less interesting interesting characters, like Everett Ross. Only this fact indicates the quality of the directing and acting.Literally, this movie should be called ""Killmonger"" and centered about Michael B.Jordan character - definitely, he has potential and Coogler knows, how to handle the actor and boost his performance. But Jordan has less screen time, then he deserves, and this fact flattened down the character to some stupid angry kid with world domination ambitions. Nobody, for some reason, reminded him, that truly free person does not want to own slaves. We again have the antagonist, that have similar powers with protagonist. We again have a couple between main hero & Lupita's character with zero chemistry between them. Seriously, interaction between BP & his sister are much more enjoyable. Looks like Shuri will be next Iron Maiden.We have a carefully calculated cast: a couple of Oscar-worthy performers, a bunch of strong women to satisfy feminists (no gays for some reason, definitely the way to improve!), rising stars and two white men just to shut up rumors about ""all-black, anti-white film"". Filmmakers were so scared to offend someone, that character Man-Ape was referenced only by name (M'Baku) and was portrayed without his iconic ape suit.We have a future-tech, rich and powerful hidden country, where king is being selected in a direct battle. Trump vs Clinton! Who wins? A small country silently decides to take the whole world just because a random guy with royal blood appeared from nowhere and ordered this monstrosity, only a small amount of rebels does not agree. Of course, other countries does not have intelligence agencies, atomic bombs and all word population can be controlled by Wakandians, especially ex-USSR, Arabic World, China, India and Asia. Civil war with blades and spears? Without beam / projectile weapons? No, we have BATTLE RHINOS! Too many plot holes and assumptions - even for a comic book movie.Two white guys - Lee and Kirby - invented the character long ago. Right now Coogler and Marvel missed the opportunity to present a really fresh, interesting story involving Black Panther - this is really sad, I was hoping (after Civil War) to see a movie without dozens of cliches and copypaste work. No mentions of MLK, Malcom X, real Black Panthers? Seriously, guys, this is not good at all. Real world is struggling to live in peace, internal conflicts are loud and clear - and You've left us with another lunatic, who wants to rule the world."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"This is my short review about Black Panther. Well, the story is pretty standard and cliche for superhero movies. I can say that the ending in accordance with most audiences. Introduction to some characters recognition has deficiencies in the introduction and thus affecting the presence and impact of this film plot, but not all of it.one of the things that impressed me so much about this movie was the musical score. Background music in some scenes uses music and instruments typically from African culture. Color patterns in costumes and places are very diverse and pamper the eyes. Wakanda's depiction is presented with great CGI and some very futuristic technology. The production design that is very different from previous Marvel films and carries African culture as its main theme. As well as the acting of some main characters are incredible. I was very impressed with Michael B. Jordan's acting as Erik Killmonger. In this film, Erik is described as very evil, cunning and intelligent but can steal the attention of the audience.Overall, this movie is my recommendation if you want to watch a different movie superhero, in terms of themes, production design and music score."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"This movie was awesome, I really want to give it a 10/10, but reality is that it is a comic book movie and I can't give it the same rating as some of the best movies to ever come out. It was an awesome movie and it shows you the protagonist's struggles of trying to be a good man and a good king. The technology and culture that this fictional nation has is sooooo cool and it plays well with the film's story. There's not a ton of black panther being black panther, but when he is its awesome. This is mostly a story of T'Challa, the man behind the black panther suit. Yes, the main antagonist is AWESOME. If you look past the ""political"" nonsense that people are associating him with and see that, he and his father were left behind by their own people!!!!!! Are you kidding me?! His father's soul is stuck in the apartment where he was killed because he didn't get a proper burial!!!!!! LIKE WHAT?? AND they left behind his son in a poor community in America when he could have been in Wakanda! Of course the bad guy is angry at Wakanda! And now he's gonna use their resources for his own agenda. People are bothered because he wants to take over the world and has a segregated agenda where his people are superior, like DUH, HE""S A BAD GUY, but one that you can understand.I apologize if this review has a combating and defensive tone, but I did feel the need to write a review for this movie because there are a lot of people hating and giving it bad reviews, and yes I am combating that by giving it a good raing. I cant believe people disliked this movie. It's sad that people are giving this movie bad reviews because its too ""political"". No it's not, the bad guy in the movie elicits bad feelings because he throws America's bad history pertaining to African-Americans in your face, newsflash he's a bad guy he's supposed to elicit bad feelings. Yes the movie is majority black people, guess what it's set in Africa of course it's going to be majority black people. All in all this movie is a fun experience and if you love comic book movies you'll love this."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"This film is an awesome experience that takes you through this fictional nation showcasing their culture, hierarchy, and technology/resources. The main protagonist is T'challa, and this film shows you the struggles he faces with trying to be a good man and a good king. He wants to do right by his people, but also feels a sense of guilt for hiding the nation and their resources from the rest of the world. The main antagonist is so great because you can see where he's coming from, so much so that even at the end T'challa does right by him. This is a great experience and a great film, there isnt so much Black Panther being Black Panther, but rather the man behind the suit.Time for the rant. People are hating on this film because it's too ""political"", no it's not. The bad guy in this film elicits bad feelings because he throws America's bad history pertaining to African-Americans in your face, newsflash he's a bad guy he's supposed to elicit bad feelings. He was abandoned by his own people and had to grow up in a poor community without his father instead of living in an amazing resourceful nation as a member of the royal bloodline. They killed his father and didn't give him a proper burial thus trapping his soul in the apartment he was killed in, like hello of course he's angry. Now hes going to use that nation's resources to fulfill his agenda which involves world domination and his people reigning superior, did you forget HES A BAD GUY? And the good guys are going to stop him. Nothing about that is ""political"" to me, and if you feel it is get over yourself. The film is majority black people, of course it is its set in Africa where the majority is black people, if this bothers you once again get over yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"This movie is awesome, the story is awesome, the fictional nation is awesome, and the bad guy is AWESOME. Oh, and the good guy is awesome too. This film takes you through a man's struggles with trying to be a good man and a good king. The action is great, there isn't so much of black panther being black panther, but rather the man under the suit. This film was a fun and great experience, if you love comic book movies, you'll love this."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,4/10,"I love the way that they make the Villain ""Klaw"" a South African!....the remnants of Appartied that took place in that Country, is lovingly reborn and brought to the forefront in this movie. The first 30 minutes is really dark so it's practically impossible to see what's going on much less understanding the English language through the really bad African accents put on by the cast."
BLACK PANTHER,1 June 2018,10/10,"I dont why people dont like it but anyway its a great movie, and I love watching it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 November 2018,10/10,THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE HAS BEEN IRONMAN FILM FROM 2008!!!!! YOU HATERS JUST DON'T GET IT!!
BLACK PANTHER,3 September 2018,1/10,Total waste of time. This stupid app thinks my review is too short so I keep om writing.
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2019,2/10,Along with Ant-man and captain America this is the worst Marvel movie so far.
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,9/10,SPOILER: I just loved the background story and the music was amazing and it really shows a different culture and how they grew. I would highly recommend this movie. It left me wanting more. Killmonger finally gets in wakanda but eventually dies which was a bit disappointed because he could have been more.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"All I can say is don't bother or wait for rental or streaming if you insist on seeing this turd as it is yet another in the long line of films in Disney's crusade to reduce every beloved fictional character to an agenda-driven caricature. In case you didn't know it: Disney did not create the Black Panther, nope, they bought him (comparison to historical evils is intentional) and milked him for all he's worth. To make matters worse, if you are old enough to remember, the character was created in precisely the opposite spirit of this trite, overly-politicized nonsense. There are some decent performances, but otherwise this film is devoid of any merit whatsoever, even within the context of the MCU. Save your money and your time or get some of the old comics, they have fun and heart, two things Disney abandoned long ago in their endless quest for the maximum profit possible."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,4/10,"Huge hype equals huge letdown with this boring film. It is by far one of the worst MCU movies to date with a mind numbing plot, poor acting, bad cgi, meh action scenes, and forced humor. Sure, there are spots were the film works for a few minutes, but as a whole, Black Panther just isn't very good. Really can't understand how so many critics love this one and how anyone would give this 10 stars. My advice is wait for the digital/dvd release and save your money."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,6/10,"SPOILER: I am on a catch-up watching films I've missed before seeing Infinity Wars, so I watched this back-to-back with two other MCU films. On it's own it would stand up fine, but compared to them it is not great. Far from bad, just not up there. 6/10 is about right: worth watching, but don't pick it over anything interesting.I do like one decision, which is to make the black characters, ""good"" and ""bad"", super racist.They make the evil South African look racially tolerant and benevolent, and the CAA operative look positively angelic (although being Martin Freeman with an American accent, a bit odd). This is an essential idea for the mythos and plot. The Wakandans are racist against tribes from other nations in the region, who they refuse to help, and a little bit racist towards the fifth Wakandan tribe; the opponents are racist in thinking Wakanda should help black Americans just because they, too are black.No side is very sympathetic therefore, which makes for an interesting plot and a film in which you invest in individual characters, not in ""sides"" because the sides (of which there are three) are all based on different bigotries"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"It's a very different refreshing kind of super hero movie.
Better than Civil War and most Marvel films.
Direction is good, CGI is above par, acting...erm...is okay, would have loved if they had shown more of Jordan and Boseman.
Two after credit scenes, do not miss those!!
Definitely waiting for the next Panther movie and Black Panther in Inifinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2020,8/10,Definitely a movie that you must watch to see them all in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2018,3/10,"I sat back for a few Months before watching BLACK PANTHER, the reviews were vert strong, but I did not enjoy this movie.
The comedy did not work, some of the acting was cringe worthy, the story line was poor, and the action did not pack a punch or made a connection emotionally.. The writing is so bad and it bothers me that this writers are getting huge sums of money for such bad scripts and one liners.. The high Review did not match my movie expectation."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"It's spoiler free. No Worries.I came here and read the movie reviews from other users before start writing my own. I think it's more of preference problem for people who rated the movie as bad, even under average. I personally loved this movie.Plot holes, sure there will always be plot holes in any movies. (Even in real life, the things that 'should go a certain way' can turn out to be the most nonsensical way though). Start with the cons, from my point of view, at some point the main conflict of the movie was pretty typical. The development pace of the movie can be a little inconsistent. Not to mention there are some CGI disappointment. Marvel-Disney production is usually one of the most decent in CGI that you sometimes can't even tell. But in this movie, in some scene the CGI are too obvious and even to the level of you think you're watching some early 2000s or even late 90s movies.Some fighting scene are just not to well shot. At some scene you can't see really well what is actually happening. The motions of the camera can make you suddenly feel motion sick, no joke.The plot are pretty predictable, but it's still pretty great how the production team can make you enjoy how the story flowed.The pros are that this movie really step out of the 'Comedic Fun Superheroes Movie' typical. It's serious, has a real issue for the character to face. It's more than just a superhero movie. It's about a growth of a man, a lifeshift of a 'prince' becoming a 'king'. It has become one of my favorite MCU movie after Civil War and Spider-Man Homecoming.I love the performance of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Both did great. Michael B Jordan delivers 'swag' to his role, though. Which is awesome.
While Martin Freeman is just being Bilbo Baggins, CIA version. (IYKWIM)Musics are great. You will really love it.Overall this movie is doing great. It makes you getting more excited and can't wait for the upcoming Avengers All Star movie, a.k.a The Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,"I love this movie, the cast, the storyline. This movie gives a feel of empowerment a feel of equality something that's hard to feel at times as a black man in America."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2018,8/10,"Marvel on top of the leaderboard yet again.
Although Black Panther isn't the best Marvel film of all time after the initial viewing of the this feature it surely is in the top 5 of best Marvel films.
All performances are entertaining and urban. I was vexed walking into the theater knowing how racially charged the buzz was over the release of the film. I came to see the Black Panther and Wakanda portrayed on the big screen, not a statement of race. Wakanda just so happens to be centered in Africa so naturally the people of this continent are of different color and man is it Badass.
Probably the best Visual effects of a Marvel movie besides Doctor Strange.
Ryan Coogler knocks it out of the park with superb direction and an even more exciting soundtrack by LA Rap Group TDE.
The film in its entirety of 2 hours and 14 min is adrenaline and smooth graphic novel style story telling.
Michael B. Jordan who had previously worked with Coogler on Creed and Fruitvale Station shines the most out if the cast delivering the coolest villian since Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2 (2004).

BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2018,3/10,"I don't know why many people love this movie, but as per my view it is worst movie of marvel.i was bored watching whole movie. In this movie there are many nonsense things like the suit, vibranium usage and most villan of the movie.
This movie seems hardly to promote some people and some particular region of Africa . There is nothing compared to other movies such as doctor strange, iron man, hulk and captain America."
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2019,5/10,The ratings for this movie is laughable .i don't understand why people giving high ratings for this one.i think it is a new way of marketing technique from marvel. i believe that most of the ratings are paid.this is only an average filmmaking and cliched plot.there is nothing wow to this movie.don't waste your time by watching this.yes i already told that this an overrated film.the only good thing here is the performance of Chadwick Boseman.he really lived upto the character otherwise it's a forgettable one.
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,5/10,It's indeed overrated but it's marvel....i found myself enjoying the scenery and the special effects and all the technology and stuff but...the actors in that movie....the acting was almost lower than the mediocre. But it's an enjoyable movie.
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,1/10,"I think this film was ok, but not to have a 10/10, come on people, acting is not good, this is what I would call and over budget film, I really recommend you to wait to watch it on cable, you will be happy you did not spend the money..."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2021,6/10,"Most of these 1 star reviews here feel very reactionary against the rave reviews of the critics. They're so dismissive or indifferent that they lack as much depth as that which they complain about the movie. Sure, it's a very flawed movie and it's awards nominations are politically motivated, but this is nothing new nor really a reason to raise up pitchforks. It's honestly something to be ignored, and what should be focused on is the goals the movie sets out to accomplish. Unfortunately it fails at most of these. So let's go through it step by step.It's visual imagination of afrofuturism is effective, albeit unoriginal. It's effective through the sheer enthusiasm it has for it's world. The CGI is amateurish, which is dumbfounding considering the budget. The only reason it works is for the minor details that flood the screen to give you a hint of life in every corner. It gives what Asgard lacks. I'm not gonna pretend this is visual worldbuilding on the level of Blade Runner or the Matrix, but it is respectable for what these movies are, as Scorscese puts it: amusement park rides. I think most people should keep that in mind. None of these movies ever rise above being entertainment, even if someone's subjective experience makes it a watershed moment or a political insult.The depth of it's cast of characters is odd and wildly inconsistent. T'Challa has the least depth of all the Marvel protagonists. The movie fails, like most Marvel movies, to make it's heroes as interesting as its villains (Thor being an exception, and Iron Man being a reverse case). Kilmonger's plan is moronic, leaving it at odds with his emotional depth. He is not as dynamic as Loki, or as subtle as the Winter Soldier, and leagues behind Thanos in plain quality (the Thanos of Infinity War). Still, his pain being his drive is a trope that is so common because it is difficult to get wrong. His dialogue, for the most part, sticks to it's strengths and powers through the illogical details of his plan to become something sympathetic. What's more important in this kind of movie is the emotional core, and Kilmonger does it right. Do the actors provide to this? Not really. But Andy Serkis does give something that borders on magnetic. And Michael B Jordan does what's needed. Nothing less or more. The rest of the actors are mediocre. There isn't much I can say about their mediocrity because it's too basic.A brief note on the action: the camera work is dizzying, which can throw some people off, but others can dig it. The choreography itself is mundane given its mythology. It is another part that is just mediocre, although there are certain climaxes in each sequence that pull you in momentarily, like a car crash or a fall from great heights.Lastly, there's the plot itself. Perhaps the biggest failure of the movie is the internal logic. At it's worst it feels like riding on a fever dream where the protagonist works on the first whim that comes to him, and the supporting characters try to explain this away with hand-waving details that mean nothing except to the hardcore fans. This would work with more humor, like most other Marvel movies do, but the spare few one liners don't give the goods. ""What are those!"" Please stop. The story tries to work alongside the visual worldbuilding, but is grossly outshone here. For example, the ritual fighting wants to be tied aesthetically with the setting, and is convincing through the work of the aesthetics themselves, because in true African history, such a practice would have centuries of history that could be felt visually. No need for oral explanations. And thus the story pretends to do as much work as the art direction.This is entertainment through and through, and if it works as a stepping stone for future, greater movies featuring afrofuturism, it should be commended. At the moment though, it's passable for a Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"Some preliminary remarks: overhyping a pop culture film into the second coming of Martin Luther King or (fitting for the title) Malcolm X never does any good, although a lot of the themes of the American civil rights movement resonate in the conflict of T'Challa and Killmonger.The film has a five act structure, which is a nice change of pace for an MCU release. The first act is mainly expository and world-building and gives an intriguing view of the nation of Wakanda. The place looks gorgeous although it is entirely CG. I am still not sure why the Wakandans have chosen to remain hidden for so long. The second act is action-packed and has the best fight scene of the entire film, the casino in Busan in South Korea. It is a signature move of Ryan Coogler to keep one long camera shot on the fight without cutting away (cf. his work in ""Creed"").Both third and fourth acts are more drama than action, especially the fourth act, building up the villain of T'Challa, his cousin Killmonger. His motives are believable but Michael B. Jordan does not give his best performance here in my view (especially if you remember him in ""Creed"", in which he was phenomenal). It was during these two acts where I lost interest a bit in the film, especially after Klauwe got killed. He was the far superior villain and this is mainly due to the phenomenal acting of Andy Serkis. Give this man more live action roles! In general, I found the acting performances to be Ok for an MCU film but nothing outstanding.The final act is all action, with lots of CG. Most of it fell flat for me, but the metal rhinos were a neat idea. The ending was nice, with Wakanda stepping out of the shadows and onto the world's stage. All in all, another good entry to the MCU, with a much more serious story (and almost no or only mild jokes! The Anti-Thor: Ragnarok of the MCU!). Best MCU film ever? No, certainly not, at least not after my initial viewing. It reminds me of coming out of ""Doctor Strange"" but with a more meaningful story and better world-building.One thing intrigued me very much: in the second act, having all these Africans in Korea, that was a glimpse into a post-white world and I would have loved to see more Asian-African crossovers. Maybe for another time!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 August 2018,2/10,"I could tell by the early reviews and trailers that this was not going to be one of my favorite MCU movies, but I expected it to at least be a fun, enjoyable movie. T'Challa is so dull and boring in this after being the BEST part of Civil War. The CGI is inexcusably bad in multiple scenes, and the jokes fall as flat as can be. Yet the worst part of the ENTIRE movie for me was the villain, Killmonger. When I tell you that this character was beyond cringe-inducing in every single scene, I am not exaggerating. I am a Michael B. Jordan fan, but this was brutal to watch. The dialogue was laughably corny and predictable, and the execution of said dialogue was equally corny and rough. I did not enjoy a single scene in this entire movie, and there is not one MCU movie I want to watch again less than this..(okay maybe Hulk)."
BLACK PANTHER,18 August 2018,7/10,"It is entertaining, but it does not reach more. a simple story that at times can be compared with others of the marvel spin-offs, they know what I mean. the heir to the throne and the fight of an enemy to prevent it"
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2019,4/10,"As obviously most people around I was kind of anxious and excited to see this movie and got massively disappointed.
It's not just that certain parts were bad, but the whole thing is just like wrong"
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2021,2/10,"The writing of the film feels extremely lazy.The first 20mins of the film introduced some really fascinating elements, but only one (kinetic energy absorbing thingy) was still used at the end.A lot of things are unexplained and exaggerated so much so that it just feels total BS. Apart from few characters the acting is just bad. Also there are a lot of racial stereotypes which seemed very offensive.One of the worst marvel movies I have ever watched."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"People need to calm down, it's literally just another Marvel movie. Killmonger is a terrible villain and way to angry, makes no sense and literally just appears at the end as some sort of god and then reigns for 5 minutes executing a plan that makes no real correlation to the very lacking backstory of his rise. It could have done with a lot more there to make him not seem like just some dude. Let's see WHY he is called Killmonger. The visuals are awesome though, credit there. I can even ignore the nationalist dictator theme seeing as Black Panther is actually a decent person. Andy Serkis and Danai Girira and the visuals are really the only redeeming features, otherwise its typical cut and paste.Hero introduces himself
Hero has a crush
Hero is challenged
Hero is betrayed
Hero comes back
Hero asks for help, denied
Hero instigates battle - the non help arrives - OOH SURPRISE! Didn't see that coming
Hero wins
Heros friends all do the tasks in the nick of time before dying
Villain dies unceremoniouslyYes, it's good. But come on... calm down. It's no better or worse than any other Marvel adventure. It's good fun but it won't leave you guessing as to what happens or how it will pan out.Could do with less pity politics and virtue signalling and some real critiquing. There is a good opportunity to make a follow up even better and tie in the whole universe a bit more."
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2018,5/10,"Worst cast ever for a marvel movie, this movie is overrated and i would not recommend it.."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,9/10,"I went into this movie like cool Ryan Coogler did great with Creed, I loved Black Panther in Civil War, and Michael B. Jordan's villain had me curious but when I saw it, I loved it. It was beautifully shot and great humor. I saw it twice during the opening weekend. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger was amazing. He was a relatable character as a person who's grown up black. Shuri and Winston Dukes characters were the standout characters and it has me so excited to see more of Wakanda in Avengers Infinity War and Black Panther 2."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther...WOW. What can I say? It's just a fantastic movie that finally showcases a demographic that have been CLAMORING for a flick showing positive imagery for A LONG TIME. Basically we've been waiting FOREVER and a DAY, for a serious Black Superhero with excellent supporting cast, and magnificent writing from a black man/crew. In a word the movie was STUPENDOUS. It was great seeing Black people portrayed in every way possible in one film. Whether they were the warrior, the villain, the usurper, the tech-wizard, the King, etc. it was fantastic to see this many black people in a movie that doesn't have to do with slavery, or drug-running, or ghettos, or ratchet behavior. A superhero film portraying a black person in a black setting, with positive imagery ... it was worth the wait.I love every moment of this movie. On criticism though - I actually wish it was a little bit longer. Like around 25 minutes longer. A couple more fight scenes and more background on other character would have been nice, but otherwise it was an almost perfect movie! Go and see it ASAP, truth knows no colour!!"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,9/10,"This white woman from the US South, now in her seventies says ""About time we were given a fascinating and uplifting story featuring our darker skinned sisters and brothers. Amusing and serious as well, this film was fun, well acted and beautiful to look at. I am sure I'll see it several more times before my end of days."""
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,7/10,"You don't have to think too much watching this movies. Just relax and enjoy the show. The plot is relatively simple. It's a story about revenge and responsibility. There are two things amazing me. The first is the accents of the actors and actresses. As a English learner, it's usually hard for me to understand every line, but this movie is relatively easy to understand because of the accents. The second is the actress playing the general. She also stars TWD. Seeing her face in the movie is so cool!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Don't waste your money if you're expecting anything more than a mediocre superhero movie. I don't understand how this is getting such high praise from critics when it simply is just a mediocre superhero movie. I would go as far to say that it is on the lower end of the spectrum from films from the MCU. This movie simply isn't good, but it isn't horrible either. It certainly has its somewhat redeeming qualities: The cinematography is masterful at times combined with the amazing CGI and set pieces make it a pleasure to look at. As well as the amazing acting/actors. But honestly I expected more from Ryan Coogler as he had in the past directed some great movies such as Creed. But even all of these amazing qualities weren't enough to make the film good. The storyline was lackluster with boring and predictable character archs which go nowhere giving the feeling of no development really being made by the end of the movie. Although some action scenes were good due to the quality CGI, the fight scenes were extremely mediocre and uninspired and became quite repetative at times. Though the weapons and gadgets used were quite col which made the fights a little more fun, but more of these should have been used to make these otherwise boring fight scenes more interesting so they don't seem to drag on as much.
Overall the movie was just meh. Nothing spectacular and nothing dreadful. Just a so-so, second rate. run of the mill superhero movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2019,9/10,What the hell is with all these bad reviews???? This film is excellent. It's a masterpiece! So much better than all the cliche superhero films that get rave reviews! It's outrageous. If you haven't watched this watch it! If you don't like it you have terrible taste and no appreciation for great cinematography!
BLACK PANTHER,18 July 2018,8/10,"At the and of the film, everything was so good. I liked the story of the film and the technology. Also we discussed about Wakanda in our class (should they open their sources to the world). As I mentioned everything was so good. But the fight between T'Challa and Killmonger was so boring. Especially while they were fighting at the subway, nothing was realistic. This is my view. But mostly I like it."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,3/10,"(Spoiler Free) 
I have to say that I really like scenery in this movie unfortunately the story line, characters and actors all failed to deliver. I almost fell asleep, something that hasn't happened to me since watching The Postman as a child. Don't expect the typical Marvel adaptation, this movie takes itself very seriously and that's one of its biggest drawbacks, it's simply not fun or entertaining, the plot is very predictable, the acting feels forced and character development is lacking. I think my low rating has to do with my initial expectations, it was nothing like I imagined. The only pros other than the cool scenery is Chadwick Boseman, he's just a great actor that did his best with what was provided to him."
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,1/10,"What a waste of time. Action is stupid, there is no logic or fun."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2020,6/10,"I waited a long time to watch this but, due to coronavirus isolation, we ran out of other material. I do not regret not having seen it until now. It's basically a collection of all of the biggest cliches in every good guy/bad guy movie. Catch a bad guy but the authorities are too incompetent to keep him from being rescued. Hidden offspring coming back to claim the throne. Hero gets ""killed"" before magically coming back to life to reclaim his place. What a yawner - it's like something that one would expect on Lifetime or the Hallmark Channel. Running time is over 2 hours and about an hour into it, I found myself wondering if I could take more than another hour.The only reason I didn't give this a lower star rating was due to the technology aspect. I found much of it quite compelling and was thinking I would have preferred that the movie spent more time on it. However, they even managed to turn that into a rehash of other films with the whole Bond/Q scene. Honestly, I half expected them to drag out a car with rockets and machine guns - that doesn't happen until later in the film though (eye roll)."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,7/10,"First of all i think i am obligated to say that this is not a race thing to me. i like the fact that we have a new black superhero movie, after years of neglect. but i don't think that fact should affect my opinion, because when it comes down to it, its really just another marvel movie. and just because it isn't whiter than a yeti in a snowstorm doesn't mean its worth a 100%, or even a 90%
with that out of the way, here is what i liked and didn't like
overall i mostly enjoyed the cast. they played the roles fine, although looking back it wasn't too above average. they acted fine, had alright chemistry, and overall i didn't mind.
the plot, i thought, was pretty good. i liked what they did with the villain, and although they could of done more with the panther, i thought the way they worked the plot was alright.
the action was also fine, could have been better, but it did its job of entertaining, and was really one of the better parts of the film.
finally, i really liked the visuals. wakanda looks pretty cool, the characters are well designed, and overall i don't really have many complaints. you COULD say it looks a bit generic, but it didn't phase me.
overall the main flaw of the movie is that it wasn't very memorable. if this film didn't have a mainly black cast, then there would be nothing that makes it stand out. there are parts that i like, like (and i hate to say this) some of the political takes were interesting. and i don't mean ""yadda yadda have black people in movies more"", thats kinda a given. what interested me was the take on bias and racism. because not only do the white characters have their bias beliefs (the fbi guy treats wakanda as pretty lesser until learns of its power), but so do the black characters. one of them calls the fbi guy a ""colonizer""(which is fair enough, but its still kinda racist), the villain hates all white people and wants to colonize THEM, the entire movie seems to have the message that hatred can come from anywhere and anyone, and instead of fighting each other over our differences and conflicts, we should band together and try to find a common ground, that will hopefully strengthen us both.
but other than that, i can't really say the movie left an impact on me. it was okay, maybe in the 75-77% range, definitely slightly above average, but nothing too special. overall its just yet another overhyped marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2019,7/10,"Giving this movie one star means the acting, writing, cinematography etc. was some of the worst you've ever seen. If you saw this movie and thought that then you haven't seen many movies.
Yes there are flaws but Michael B Jordan plays a good villain with believable motives. How many movies fail to do that? I actually liked his character more than the Black Panther himself. This is a good movie that entertained me and that's all I expected it to be. If you watched this movie thinking it would ground breaking then lower your expectations."
BLACK PANTHER,13 August 2018,6/10,"Oh boy is this the most average MCU movie. This movie is what I'd call a formulaic inoffensive MCU movie. It's just laughable how this movie became a litmus test to determine if a person is racist or not. And don't give me the bs that it's the first black superhero movie, just watch Blade and spare me with that load of baloney. At least Blade did something different than what other superhero movies were doing at the time *cough* Batman and robin *cough* crow *cough*. It might sound like I'm saying its a terrible movie because its not. But its also not a great movie and was certainly over-hyped. It's just passable. The acting was great, the world of Wakanda looked really cool and original, the music was a bit unique when you compare it to the other MCU movies' random orchestra noises. But that's not enough to save this movie suffering from a criminally generic plot."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"It should be said that all characters have been exquisitely cast. Chadwick remains a very strong Black Panther and the secondary characters are brought to live admirably. Especially Danai Gurira as Okoye and Letitia Wright, as his brilliant younger sister, shine in their parts.
The music is also really good, which gives you an extra reason to linger during the credits while you wait for the usual fun bonus.
Ludwig Goransson deserves all the praise because the orchestral music that blares during the exciting moments is also filled with African instruments. 
A very nice look at a superhero world in which African cultures are honoured. A good story about a prince who has to take on the role of a king and the change in the political climate.This movie differs from other MCU movies and it is close to ""CA:winter soldier"",quality wise"
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,6/10,"The acting in this movie is for the most part pretty decent (I thought the girl who played black panthers sisters acting was pretty bad) But the worst part about this film is one simple thing... Its bland, the editing is horrible, the cinematography is the typical bland marvel style. There are some scenes I really liked and thought looked great but for the most part the cinematography is bad. A lot of the effects are crap. But other than the technical stuff the movie is pretty good and I would recommend it to most people. If you just want a fun movie to watch with your friends and family then I would recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,I loved. Like i said it's one of a few good MCU movie. Not so comedic. Enough. And battle scenes were great. But about villain there weren't so much scenes about him. They could've given him more play. And of course there were cliche scenes. But like i said it's one of a few good MCU movies. At least not joke like Thor Ragnarok. And what i like is there weren't so much feminism element that ruined the movie like it did on Thor Ragnarok and everything else.
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2019,4/10,Couldn't really watch it til the end.. Was so slow and boring. Cringy dialouge and stupid things sprinkled through the whole thing
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"It is a bit slow before the intermission, but being the first solo movie for Black Panther I understand it. Character development is on point for everyone. The villain played by Michael B. Jordan is commendable and you can relate to him. Definitely give it a shot. The music will get stuck in your head."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,9/10,"It continues to amaze me how many unique and interesting plots the MCU can generate. The plot was further enhanced by some of the best acting to date in a Marvel movie. Michael and Chadwick play strong lead characters but the supporting cast stole the show! Danai G, Daniel K, Letitia W, and Winston D were all equally amazing. Each one of these characters could easily have spin offs on Netflix.This movie similar to Guardians in that a decade ago if you would have told me there would be a Black Panther movie I would have not known much about it other than a comic exists and that the movie would likely fail due to obscurity. Not the case. Honestly, this movie stands solid on its own even outside the MCU. This ranks near the top of the MCU movies thus far, better than Ant Man, the Thor series, the IronMan sequels, and Ultron (7's and 8's). It's only slightly lower than Avengers, Civil War and Guardians (9's and 10's) but not by much. I'd say it's on par with Winter Soldier which is equally amazing."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"Wowowow everyone, wowie. If I could put this movie anywhere, if would be in a museum because not only is it a work of art, it is a masterpiece, plus everyone in this movie is way more attractive than the Mona Lisa. Everything about it is amazing, the seamless transition between African traditions and crazy new technology was outstanding. Erik Killmonger is the greatest Marvel villain now, and not because he's hot, but because he made excellent points and made you question whose side was right. The character growth T'Challa had made me feel like a proud Soccer Mom. Don't even get me started on Shuri or any of the other beautiful and amazingly talented ladies in this film. I swear I fell in love about 50 times watching the movie. Overall, the best Marvel movie and my current topic of conversation for the next 5 months. The only thing that could use improvement is how behind Wakanda is on memes. My only parting remark is that I would put my life on the line for this movie and any of the characters could kill me and I would come back as a ghost to thank them. Ok, that's it."
BLACK PANTHER,30 October 2018,4/10,"The story lines are good, the details are very bad, too many fighting scenes and the end is not very good. But it's beautiful sight."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2018,5/10,"I went to the movie theater to see this film, excited by all the hype, but was ultimately majorly disappointed. Chadwick Boseman had a stellar performance, along with Academy Award Lupita Nyong'o. The characters were more complex than the characters in other Marvel movies, but the plot was predictable and boring, ruining the unique characters. 
 The setting of Wakanda was majestic and eye catching. The new technology reflected their advanced society. Once again, the plot did not live up to the setting. The concept and message of the movie was powerful. Black oppression is what created Wakanda, and fueled the tension. It is not unusual for Marvel movies to have a political message, but 'Black Panther's' had a more relevant stance. 
 'Black Panther' was empowering to African American's and touched on political issues in the U.S. Overall, it was very boring, which allowed the audience to overlook the outstanding performances and setting."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is the story of a country far far away called Wakanda.. A futuristic country where its rare mineral Vibranium has been mined for thousands of years and holds immense power, both for building armor, weapons, healing and for other technologies as well. This metal has the ability to solve alot of problems on Earth... The rulers of Wakanda, a powerful monarchy, where the king is granted super powers and technology such as the Black Panther suit, are set out to help other nations recover from problems they are facing.. However, there is a threat to their country, as evil people want to get their hands on the rare metal known as Vibranium, as well as take over control of the monarchy. The story is set between Wakanda and America, but also ventures into Korea as well. The main character T'challa holds Kingship in Wakanda, and thus is granted powers as the Black Panther. His father and uncle both died for the cause (to keep Wakanda's legacy and help solve the worlds problems). T'challa's morality and mission is threatened by the antagonist who has a different plan for Wakanda, after living through the hardships faced by African Americans in the United States. The antagonist envies yet also craves what the Wakandans have, power, technology, and sovereignty.Overall, the action and spectacle is an 8/10. The plot doesn't go to deep into T'Challa's past, and leaves some unanswered questions about him and the nation that is Wakanda, but besides that the story is a solid 6/10. The characters are what really shine in this movie, as well as the message that you are left with at the end.A great watch for 2018!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"The initial reviews were so good for this movie that I felt compelled to see the movie in the theater. Viewing it in standard format was probably not the best choice, and it is quite possible I would have given it a higher rating after watching it on an Imax screen. The pros- Chadwick Boseman did a great job as the Black Panther. He was a strong character and was fun to root for. Some of the visuals were very well done. Many of the set designs are also effective. 
The cons- Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was not very good. His street accent was on the verge of comical. The CGI was not horrible but did get a bit much at times. The storyline was generic. Summary- I would recommend to see the movie, just do not waste the money to see it in the theater."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"1st off Michael B Jordan/Andy Serkis stole the show. GREAT Villains. Letitia Wright impressed me with her performance on the show Black Mirror. This movie needed her like humans need Air & Music. She always lightened room the provided much needed laughter with subject matter that can serious at times. 
 
This disconnect in culture, feeling of abandonment, and shame of way we treated and still treat each other was touched on perfectly. The best way to enjoy this movie is to suspend your political & personal beliefs if don't agree & respect the storyteller."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,3/10,"97% on RT, that will really get me and everyone else I know into the theaters to watch this film. Please give me my money back. Lame action scenes, lame story, lame characters and a lame superhero, indicative of so many comic book characters being made into films these days. The Hollywood film industry has lost it's artistic flare. In the past, the critics use to have our backs; those days are long gone."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,3/10,"The insanely high critical reviews on this film make me wonder if film critics themselves have gone the way of the main stream media. Corrupt, biased, PC and always always watching for ratings, clicks and eyeballs.I have a simple test I perform after watch all movies in a theater. I ask myself, how many time do I want or need to see this this film? Black Panther is a film i would only need to see once. Thor, Spiderman and a bunch of other marvel films I've seen recently are in the same boat for me. compare that to a movie like Interstellar which I've see over 20 times. My problem isn't with the film, Black Panther, go see it, it's fun. But does it deserve the kind of critical reviews it has gotten or worthy of a second viewing. Probably not."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is a another home run for Marvel Studios, and a welcomed addition to the cinematic universe.The film has great 3 dimensional characters; especially the villain. The story is well thought out and the directing by Ryan Coogler is wonderful. There are strong female characters in this film and they steal many scenes brilliantly.The visual effects are great and Wakanda is vividly brought to life. The soundtrack is really atmospheric and adds a great deal to the viewing experience.Is it the best Marvel Studios film? No. It is a fantastic addition that also has a political and social statement to make."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2021,3/10,"I went to see Black Panther along with my friends, and following the hype train we were excited to see it. However, following the showing we were all dissapointed by a mess of a movie with little plot and little thought which only served as a pit stop for infinity war.The critics have vastly overrated this movie due to its groundbreaking cast, but the movie itself is not at all groundbreaking. Littered with all the boring Marvel clich√©s I have come to know and hate, such as their inability to kill off any hero's to add gravitas to their story, or the one dimensional villain who only exists for one movie so you know they will kill him off before the next, Black panther is also plagued by new problems no one but me seemed to notice. For example, the CGI was awful in the action scenes: whenever someone was even prodded, they would go flying across the screen in the most outlandish fashion, and the plot was torn straight out of the Lion King, as well as having the biggest waste of Martin Freeman since those Vodafone adverts.Overall, I believe my dissapointment for this movie is fuelled by the marvel cinematic universe, as I feel sick of the movies they are pumping out like an industrial machine, as they all feel the same with little originality. I can only hope the bubble will burst sometime soon, and bring back true standalone movies which don't need a cinematic universe. Overrated and overhyped."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,2/10,"Thor ragnorok was better and funner . 
This is a quicky. I prefer moviews like Guardians of The Glaxy1 and Thor Ragnorok Not bad but flat in some places"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,2/10,"Someone else nailed it. I go to movies to have fun. This one---re eh. Personally I say consider renting it. 
It's a little known hero. Not quite lighthearted enough for my taste. On one hand Tchula and the cast tried. On ther hand to be honest Thor Ragnorok for was simply more fun. Because it doesn't take it self seriuslly and was gloriusly fun.Imo it'd work as a rental, not so much as a go to the theater thing."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"This is an awesome movie. The characters are played by some of the best actors in Hollywood. The movie has the right amount of drama, humor and tragedy. One of the biggest complaints about Marvel Movies is the lack of compelling villains. That is definitely not the problem in the Black Panther. I hope both of the villains in the Black Panther are in future Marvel movies. Well, I am going to have to end my comments because I am off to see The Black Panther for a 2nd time!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,6/10,"It's very pretty and the political and moral delema in the film is very interesting and both sides have great points. however instead of focusing on the intresting parts in the film instead everyone just starts fighting. The chance scene is pointless and the special effects are lackluster. This movie is a refreshing change in the superhero formula though and I was entertained. The odd thing is that in this movie the main villain killmonger is totally right on his side of the argument, but in order to make him evil they exaggerated his character to wanting to overthrow everyone instead of easily just sitting down and talking through it. So plot has holes but is well done and interesting."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,The movie black panther is really fun to watch Killomonger was a great villain and Black Panther was a great hero it was a good story and really fun to watch.
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,This movie Black Panther shows the amazing story of T'Challa and Wakanda. Also the enemy Killmonger acted by Michael B Jordan was a great villain. If you are planning to see black panther you are going to have a good time
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,Amazing movie Black panther was awesome Chadick Boseman was a great black panther Michael B Jordan was a amazing Erik Killmonger all the actors were great actually and i am speechless at how good the movie is.
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,7/10,"I have been having a sort of ""burn out"" with superhero films lately, so I wasn't originally planning to see Black Panther at all. However, I kept hearing how great and awesome this ""masterpiece"" was, so I decided I would go see it (and at this point, it really is just something that's expected, which is fine). So, I went in with marvelous expectations (aside from some criticisms I had heard beforehand), and... how was it?
Well, let me just say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was WAY better than I thought it was going to be, and it was really fun to watch. All of the performances are generally great (except for a few which I'll get in to), and the plot is good as well. There are some issues, however, that bring the movie down, which I'll go into spoiler free at first. Some of the special effects are just downright bad (there are bits where you can actually tell the person is standing in front of a green screen), and there is dialogue that is spoken that just seems... off. I don't know, it just seems misplaced and weird-sounding. Also, it is hard to ignore the fact that yes, the plot is good, it is certainly a Marvel plot, if you know what I mean.
My biggest issue with the movie, and the one that brings it down so much, is that there is a side plot that is completely unnecessary, and completely ruins the tone of the film. Basically, the only reason this side plot exists is to add a little more to the end, and to give the main characters a little more motivation. That's it.
In conclusion, check this out if you want a fun superhero movie, that's better than a lot of recent ones, but also has a few problems (7/10)."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,6/10,"I was so excited when Black Panther came into the Marvel universe and the character was done very well by Boseman. The costume was over the top awesome and my favorite part of ""Civil War"" was Black Panther fighting Capt and Winter Soldier. I've always thought T'Challa was a great character with an interesting background and an interesting plot line. The land of Wakanda and the King and it's people all had struggles of their own and it seemed like a great starting for a full-length feature about the Black Panther's world.Unfortunately the magic that I had hoped for was lost along the way. The story line was acceptable but the character of Killmonger was flat and not interesting at all. The acting overall was decent but some of the support cast wasn't up to par. As this is a superhero movie I would have rather it stayed away from being preachy even in the slightest. This isn't a sweeping historical drama, this is an action movie. Or so it should have been. The CGI was good in some parts but not in others. The fight at the end between T'Challa and Killmonger when they both had on their suits looked like they were made of rubber. I do not care for political correctness being in superhero movies and wish they could have just let it be a fun and entertaining movie solely. Ultimately disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,8/10,"I love the storyline so much. Marvel has done a very good movie. So many things are unexpected, but the story is so predictable. This film shows 2 guys with their own principle, fighting for Wakanda. Killmonger are damn right about what Wakanda are supposed to be, but inside him, because his anger for his father's death, he had a wrong method. So, T'Challa are here to make it right.Marvel's character has so many potential good story, i hope Marvel's next film are better than Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,6 September 2018,8/10,"Black panther was a good installment to the mcu. Only thing I didn't like was the ending battle between killmonger and T'Challa, I get that the only way killmonger could be killed was if he went on that train track there and the force deactivates the suit but I wish it looked better or idk somehow changed the whole thing becusse it just did not hit for me. Everything else was good I like the characters and the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,7/10,It's one of the more orginal movies of the MCU but falls flat on it's 2nd act where it gets boring and predictable.
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,8/10,Really liked it. Ignore the haters and go watch it. Saw it twice at the movies
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,7/10,"Look the movie is obviously good to watch. 
Pros:-
This movie shows the world of wakanda in a very good way and it is really great when you watch it in 3D.Cons:-
Same story. I am not going to spoil anything but in story I don't find anything new. I want some thriller and action not just simple story and action."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,8/10,"I think this movie gets a unfair reputation from the people who take the fact that the cast is mostly consisted of black actors far too seriously. This movie has very good cinematography, decent to ok characters(with the exception of the superb Killmonger). For god sake guys stop seeing this film as a negative or positive outlook for racial inequality and take it for what it is. A superhero film."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,3/10,"An overrated mediocre funfair, with decent casting choices but thats about that. Main character had so much potential in another movie (Civil war) but the director of Black Panther clearly had something different in mind. Main villain is forgetable, his agenda is just wrong for this type of movie. Modern flicks cant be imagined without CGI, but here, it is used in abundance that it feels more like a video game at some moments."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2018,8/10,"This movie blew me out of the water. Going in to see this movie, I was not familiar with this character. But how they explained the back story of the black panther, along with conflicts with the wakandan throne at the same time was cool. I also liked how they intergrated african cultural traditions such as lip plates and scarifcations and such. This movie should definately be nominated for some sort of costume award. The storyline was also very action pact and neat"
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,10/10,"I love the low reviews trying to LOWER the IMDB Rating. Who could give this fantastic movie a low rating, let me try and guess.... HAHAHA!
This movie was FANTABULOUS. (My way of saying Fantastic and Fabulous).
Oh when the Blu ray is finally released, I will watch it over and over again! 
Great Actors who deserve OSCARS!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 September 2018,2/10,What a dog of a movie - overrated and overhyped. Not very original and nothing really interesting going on.
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,7/10,"Now I understand that a big reason for this movie's popularity is the fact that it is made up of primarily black people. Now don't get me wrong, I think this is great; in fact I would say it needed to happen. This is something we've never seen in a superhero movie and it was quite refreshing. Erik Killmonger is an excellent antagonist; in my opinion, the best in the MCU (at least until Thanos came around). He was a great opponent to T'Challa physically and emotional due to their very apparent clashing ideologies. The reason I say that is because his motive and his cause is something that is very relate-able to the US today. Many people still feel a sense of racial prejudice and he resembled that pretty well. The only problem is that he was really only in the second half of the movie. The first half was about Andy Serkis character and his whole crusade for vibranium. I think he did pretty well, but he and the Black Panther had no qualities that really resonated well together; I just wasn't interesting in the story for the first half. Then once Killmonger comes back it's a totally different movie with a new plot. Why? Because Ryan Coogler wanted to tell Killmonger's story and he simply had Andy Serkis in the film to keep up continuity after Age of Ultron... Black Panther as a character was very boring and un-compelling to me. The CGI was mediocre at best; there were multiple times where I was taken right out of a scene because I was focusing on the background that was very clearly fake. I also thought the cinematography was questionable, especially during the fight scenes. I am tired of shaky tight shots during big action scenes, which this film has a lot of. Check this movie out of you want to, but I'd say you'll live by passing it up."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,2/10,"The special effects were good, so I guess it gets a few points for that. Otherwise, it's a generic, predictable, formulaic, and sub-par Disney/Marvel mess that sports gratuitous eye candy for little kids. Hopefully, its sequel will be better. Its no-surprises, boring plot is what really killed it, and I found myself not really caring about the characters or the setting at all because of it. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this one since I didn't really know much about the comic book character at all."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I can't help but think that the people who gave this movie less than 5 stars are bias and hateful. I can understand some of the criticism given. Some things are becoming a bit repetitive in the Super Hero movies but to give it a 1 star or even 2 or 3 stars is just ridiculous! Now that that is out of the way...The movie is a visual spectacle, now, I know many movies are nowadays. Besides it just looking good, it feels good. It has strong female characters like we havent seen in a while. Which is refreshing. The plot, predictable but satisfying. Acting, top notch and all in all an extremely enjoyable movie.My 10 star rating is like the 1 star ratings. Not really the rating it deserves (i would give it 8 stars) but I feel like I need to at least do something about that. I don't review very often but to see this movie getting bashed for the wrong reasons, just pissed me off a little!Sorry for the rant.Go watch it!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 September 2018,10/10,"Soundtrack. Acting. Writing. Directing. Everything about this film was simply beautiful to me. Not even halfway through and it became my all time favorite. I watched it for the second time last week and will find time to watch again this week. So grateful to see us portrayed on screen as the royal beings we are!!!WE WILL RISE!!!!!PS
This film was dop amazing and inspiring, we started a summer camp of the same name. haha!!! #WakandaForever"
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2019,1/10,This movie is so boring and the cgi is like something off a ps3 game. Now some scenes are really good this shouldn't be this overrated.
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2019,2/10,Same like most of the Marvel movies this movie is also childish. I think this movie has so many black people that's why it was become a blockbuster. Even VFX is also ordinary (Where Marvel movies are good). The last fight scene's VFX is so lame. There is no story & whole movie is predictable. Better to skip this. Only think is good in this movie is Black panther's costume & Jungle.
BLACK PANTHER,16 October 2018,5/10,"Disappointing. Just another superhero film but with a strangely realized African spin.I could not quite get over how the Wakandan culture made no sense at all. They somehow became a super advanced country courtesy of finding Vibranium yet didn't get around to ever working out how to develop a democracy or proper legal system but rather having totalitarian regimes ruled by Kings who are chosen on their ability to physically fight each other - i.e. stone age tribe stuff. And when they get injured there's no sign of the super-duper technology but rather they're reaching for some healing plant or other. It's like you discovered some primitive tribe out in the depths of the Amazon rainforest and found they happened to have iPhones. Weird.I can't work out if it's politically correct garbage or racist garbage. Are we being shown that black African cultures could be super advanced or being shown that even if they were, they'd still be acting like primitive tribes - which by the way, they're not even now.All that aside, I found much of the acting pretty awful and the rest of the plot and effects just bog standard. Overall very average. Defo will not be eagerly awaiting Black Panther 2"
BLACK PANTHER,23 October 2018,8/10,"Overall I found this movie very entertaining it is packed with action and some moments of comedy and suspense. The way the director creates each individual character is very unique they each character has special characteristics that is unique to them. Also the way he introduces new characters throughout the movie , in example when he first introduced Killmunger he was seemed to be the general villainous role but as the character develops we see the way that he came to be and the cause of his anger"
BLACK PANTHER,21 November 2018,,"It's okay not bad it not great, I really wanted to enjoy this movie instead I found myself bored and uninterested. The actors are fine the best being Michel b Jordan, but even they couldn't save the movie from being just being okay. The story is also just average it follows nothing special. I would probably have this movie playing at my family gatherings and watch from time to time and that's as far as I would go."
BLACK PANTHER,15 January 2019,6/10,A lot of things wrong with this movie but the fact that I don't usually watch super hero films and managed to finish this makes me say that it's good enough
BLACK PANTHER,13 January 2019,6/10,"The stale fight choreography really lets the film down. I found the fight scenes dull and listless due to poorly constructed sequencing. Costume design is on-point and of course the film has political and cultural significance. The characters are a bit hit and miss, Michael B Jordan as villain Erik Killmonger is the standout.
A polarising movie, overrated by many reviewers giving 10 stars and completely underrated by all the haterz with 1 stars. The reality is somewhere in between."
BLACK PANTHER,21 January 2019,10/10,What can i say it's just an awesome movie!! I'm waiting for part2 patiently.
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2019,1/10,"The movie was okay as an entertainment movie yes its a bit overrated but okay,
what really disappointed me is the using of many Berber and Egyptian symbols to refer to an ""imaginary"" Black or sub-saharan culture , I can't believe that political correctness reached this limit of history hijacking and cultural appropriation
Just cause this this cultures are in North africa doesn't make it automatically
sub-saharan african !! there's Berber and egyptians still embracing there history
and such un reasonable acts would is really dangerous for human history."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,8/10,"With the unreasonable amount of negative reviews written about this movie I feel compelled to write one myself even though I normally don't It isn't hard to guess that this is a coordinated online campaign orchestrated by people who seem to think that an almost all black cast and powerful female characters isn't something that should become mainstream. Because this is a good movie as the vast majority of users and critics agree. It's a super hero movie. Not Bergman. And in that genre it is excellent. So if you're thinking of seeing it, don't be put off by a small amount of probably racist trolls. Just go see it."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,6/10,"Black Panther is a very entertaining movie so in one sense it's 'job done', but there's not a great deal of substance beneath the style. Far too many cliches, and plot developments that make little sense, despite it looking very fresh due to its largely African setting. After the character's impressive introduction in Captain America: Civil War, this is a little disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2020,5/10,Fun themes and decent story line but that American challenger dude was miscast! He really messed it up with his street talk. How did they get it so wrong?!
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2019,9/10,Liked the movie a lot! Make-up and costumes are absolutely great as well as acting and story.
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,10/10,üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,7/10,"I'm the type of person who HATES modern movies, but I was bored and curious to find a new move to watch and low and behold, I started watching Black Panther. It's a good movie with a lot of action and actors I've never heard of except Gerard Butler.. Michael B Jordan did a good job as well. Glad I have this a chancw. Hope a sequel is made."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2021,10/10,Definitely one of the best Marvel movies. The story is good and there are a lot of great actors in this movie.
BLACK PANTHER,12 July 2019,8/10,"Amazing, stunning, magnificent! Action scenes, acting chops (T'Challa, his sister, and his GF especially) were on point. FULL OF BADASSERY. Loved Martin Freeman's role too! Plenty of smart comic relief that made me BATMN. I dunno why I waited this long to see this! The story weaved a tale of the clash between the giving of service to the world VS the safety and security of one's own self, with a hero who had to overcome his own fears for his nation's safety and open his heart to the rest of the world, the outsiders who he didn't mind ignoring in the past. This really needs a sequel, though--for although he did what was right, there must be a tradeoff, and I didn't get to see the magnitude of the sacrifices yet (although I did get a taste of them) that are needed to flesh out the whole story."
BLACK PANTHER,26 September 2019,9/10,"Black Panther is one of the best movies that I've seen in such a long time, and probably one of my all time favorites. From the acting and screenplay to the special effects and creative visuals, I thought everything was superbly done. I also really enjoyed how distinguishable this film was from other superhero movies; with a unique plot and talented cast, this was unlike any other film of its sort that I've seen. Superhero cinema has certainly been elevated with the release of this film."
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2020,3/10,"This got Oscars? So, there is the heir to the throne, failing to win a fight in front of the local gangs/tribes. The kingdom/ghetto even has withered grafitti and poor sellers of handmade wares in the dust, while the gang leaders live in tech paradise. Since the new head of the gangs/tribes is a war monger some decide to support the loser leading to an all out gang war - typically the chosen weaponry is more for gangsta style than for use in war, similar to the tactics.
Instead of gold chains the ""hero"" wears panther teeth made out of a silvery metal around his neck.
And that is the much lauded depiction of an advanced African society? Really?
Otherwise the movie is below average Marvel stuff, not enough banter and takes itself too serious."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2020,6/10,"This origin superhero story is racially charged, enthralling for its world-building of Wakanda, and memorable characters. It was inevitably predictable due to its Hamlet heart. 6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2020,10/10,I love watching this movie. Already seen it 3 times!
BLACK PANTHER,18 August 2021,8/10,Ok first of all I don't say I hate marvel fan boys but mannnn marvel releases something good without any iron man or Thor fan boys say it's bad because they don't get to see their favourite character.
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2021,3/10,Black Panther is easily the most overrated Marvel movie. There are only a couple Marvel movies that are worse than this one and it gets ridiculously high scores. It is mediocre in almost every way.
BLACK PANTHER,24 September 2018,2/10,The best part of the film was the erie setting when the boys were playing basketball and a few floors up these 2 guys get a mysterious knock at the door. I though the movie would be pretty good but from that moment on it was pretty unwatchable. I fell asleep twice trying to get through it. The plot could not hold my interest.
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2021,9/10,"Everybody keeps saying there was not enough humor in the movie, well, let me tell you something, if you read the comics, you'll know that Black Panther is a serious storyline. So stop using there is not enough humor in the movie as an excuse, just sit back and enjoy this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2021,9/10,After chadwick boseman i don't think anyone could replace him. Its another thing that part 2 is coming Starring boseman. The journey from becoming King of Wakanda and showing all south african culture black panther is the best character in terms of being a kind king. But wakanda is not explained properly i think that there is something missing about wakandan history even though the movies starts with the introducTion of wakanda the origin place of uranium with all technological advancements .At last WAKANDA FOREVER.
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2018,10/10,I'm only gonna say I can't stand most superhero movies from either franchise. This is a great movie. Unfortunately most people will play there far left views. This is one of the best movies in this genre. Sad that all those people who have nothing better to do but sit in there mothers basement and make up fake reviews. Watch this movie.
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2018,6/10,"Make no mistake, this is an average run-of-the-mill typical Marvel formulaic movie experience and nothing else. Is the movie good? Yes. Is this movie life defining as suggested by critics and deserving of all of its hyperbolic and autistic screeching praise? No. I gave it a 6 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,8 July 2018,2/10,"Everything about the movie is bad. No art, no act, no originality. Just an unnecessary action movie."
BLACK PANTHER,5 November 2018,1/10,"Poorly written, acted and directed, with ridiculous visual effects. A few stereotypes on black people and poverty in a not-believable script. Totally disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2020,1/10,"Boring, boring, boring. Turned it off fast forwarded a bit to see if it improved. And then skipped to the end credit scenes."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,2/10,"Well what can you say about this mess, the critics have obviously felt pressured into liking this movie for some reason or another, and they are going to cost a lot of people their hard earned money, and give most of them a huge disappointment. I love marvel super hero movies, this was a B-movie at best, like something swept up from the cutting room floor and thrown out the door. Under any other circumstance this movie would never be released, it is completely sub-par for marvel's current high standards. Representations of Africa and Africans were childish, cartoonish and patronising, and reminded me of 1920s safari brochures or victorian era stereotype propaganda, just a farce. A missed opportunity and once the real reviews start making the headlines and word of mouth spreads as to how bad the acting, story and dialogue are, it will single handedly destroy any chance of a similar film being released for the next 20 years. Just a boring movie, very poor quality for marvel and total disappointment. This will be the only time you see black panther movie so if you really feel the need to waste your money, you had better see it, because there won't be a sequel."
BLACK PANTHER,11 September 2018,2/10,In watching this black rendition of Marvel I found myself laughing outloud at the scene with the Gorilla king when the one white guy in the movie was trying to speak and all the gorilla clan starting barking at him. The king says you cannot speak or i will feed you to my children. I'm still laughing. If was a black person I think i would be extremely unhappy at this stereotypical portryal if the black culture. Besides this little snippet the rest of the movie was garbage.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Saw Black Panther and could not be more satisfied. Plot and acting are on point. The characters are complex without being contradictory - I actually felt sympathy for the bad guys at times. Complex cultural issues are presented without being heavy-handed or preachy. Should a country be isolationist? When do you betray a friend? your country? When is it okay to question authority? your mentor? your parent? All smoothly admixed with stunning visuals, awesome action scenes, and a touch of humor. The costumes are unique and beautiful on all genders. And the prominent and integral role of the women is impressive, especially for an action movie. The 4DX platform is icing on the cake. Black Panther delivers 100% as a Marvel movie and as an action movie. I look forward to seeing more movies about these characters soon!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,10/10,Such a great movie. A story that deserves many more movies.
BLACK PANTHER,30 November 2019,1/10,"Waisted part of my life watching this horrible, pretentious, unrealistic, silly and overrated African narm. There is no harmony in Africa because everyone is different. There's more diversity among Homo sapiens in Africa than any place on earth. Just because you have black skin makes you my brother is an idealistic bunch of hogwash. Anyway, the CGI stunk, the characters were one demential and the production design laughable in its over use of oddball African motifs. Also, this film actually thinks its audience will believe there was a futuristic, modern African country with a hyper sonic subway and super technology around when the Belgian Congo was a systemic holocaust. Why didn't this goofy nation, light years ahead of the world, stop that genocide? I'll answer my own question: because the writer, producers and director didn't have an iota's worth of knowledge about the history of Africa nor did they bothered to do any research. The antagonist of the film was a conglomeration of hip hop gangsta clich√©s. The only believable character was the bewildered white dude going through the motions of acting. Hollywood has been the worst perpetuator of stereotyping in the history of the world. Anyone who liked this film and praised it was either phony PC virtue signaling, lacking in taste or both. This film denigrates African culture because African culture is complex and is not the simplistic Western hodgepodge of tropes this film is. This film is a real stinker, and all involved in its creation should do like Tony Manero did in ""Saturday Night Fever"" and give the trophy to a real winner."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,4/10,"Black Panther, I give it a 4 out of 10.
Maybe a 5, it is almost all computer graphics and story-line going no where.
Lots of good special effects, but very very predictable
Special effects are great, but story-line is worse then a B grade movie"
BLACK PANTHER,18 November 2018,1/10,Legit watching paint dry or grass grow would probably result you in having a batter time then watching this garbage. I don't even understand how they made this movies everything is terrible. Barely makes sense. Such a poor attempt. Please don't watch this.All these reviews are so sad you don't need to support this movie to make yourself feel better it was bad what do you want.
BLACK PANTHER,12 July 2021,2/10,As a stand alone movie is did not pull me in and make me want to watch it. I have since learned that the movie was part of a much bigger story and mart of some Marvel universe. But without that backstory if quickly became just a mess for me and my wife. I had recorded it from our movie channel and I had no second thoughts about giving another chance some other day and just deleted it.
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,4/10,"I love comic book movies and this was great but in a any movie has to have some reality to it or there is nothing to overcome. Wakanda, the city is just a rip off of Atlantis. The entire movie is made less believable and immersive by making the nation over the top. The racism in the movie is laughable only because we know that if similar jokes were made at the expense of blacks, there would be outrage and really only show the hypocrisy or ignorance of movie makers. All and all it was a fun movie but it doesn't deserve a place in the MCU. It could have been a better movie."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,10/10,This movie rocked my world!!!! Love everything about it! The best of it's kind! The best!
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,A refreshing new take on a superhero. Some great characters. The plot was a little thin. A bit slow at times. Fight scenes went on a bit too long but better than most.
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2019,2/10,"I'll never watch this movie again, nor will I see the sequel. I'll be surprised if anyone sees the sequel. This cracked my Top 10 worst movies all time. It's right up there with Daylight and Get Rich or Die Tryin.' How it is nominated for any award aside from stunts is a puzzler. Spend your time on anything else!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,1/10,"If you want to see a good film with an African based protagonist, watch any variation of Tarzan or King Kong. Even Magilla Gorilla cartoons had richer dialogue, more finely developed characters and a lot more credibility. Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, which is widely considered to be the worst film ever, was far more believable than this high budget, super hyped trash.Stories with boundaries of imagination, as Rod Serling put it, still have rules within the fantasy worlds they create. If the premise of the story is a man who can read minds or a woman who is compelled to tell the truth, the reality of the created world stays within the walls of that premise. The mind reader can't just instantaneously develop super powers and use them to knock out his charging enemies. Superman can fly, toss buildings around, bend bridges and even turn back time but he can't just build a flying space ship around his body and have it shoot missiles at armies. This film makes it up as it goes. Fights are decided based on how much strength and how many weapons instantly become accessible to a given warrior, at a given moment. If the filmmakers want someone to be losing a battle, his or her enemy will have the strength, weapons and indestructibility to win. If they want the fight to turn around, anything and everything the person needs to reverse it and emerge victorious will miraculously appear. There are no rules or boundaries within the reality they attempt to create, so in turn, there is zero credibility. People believe the impossible but not the improbable. This is an impossible story that throws in new improbables with virtually every frame.IMDB users seem mostly unified in feeling that this film is beyond awful. For whatever reason, it still has a 98% score from Rotten Tomatoes. And for whatever reason, after I rented the film from my cable provider, I wasn't given the option of rating it. I guess, if millions of dollars are spent to promote a Hollywood blockbuster, sites like Rotten Tomatoes only allow those who support their agendas to vote. Read the other IMDB reviews before you squander your time and money on this one. There are a limited number of hours in all of our lives and watching this film is a total waste of two of those hours."
BLACK PANTHER,8 July 2018,8/10,"Haha, all of these negative reviews are just ridiculous."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,2/10,"What to start with . This movie is absolutely poor . Bad acting bad plot , bad CGI ...really you expect a marvel movie with a bad CGI . The dialogues were very poor and cheesy . i really dont know why people were praising this movie .
Piece of crap, highly recommend to avoid this film if you are a fan of super hero movies"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"Pros:
Chadwick Boseman is convincing as Black Panther. His costume is so cool. The chase scene in S. Korea is awesome. Michael B Jordan steals the show hands down. He is a cool anti-hero you can relate to.Cons:
Linear plot. Americans doing a bad African accent. Too many cliches."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,10/10,"I don't understand why people here are trying to trash such an amazing movie. It's not a hype. This movie is truly great. Finally an action movie that is not racists or sexist, but just cool, fun, and full of great action sequences. Just because this is not a pale white fat guy's fantasy, some of the users here are giving it a hard time.
I was a huge fan of deadpool and loved every bit of it. But then this one is much more. It has a cool concept and real story. Visuals are great, and acting is as good as it gets for an action movie! And a lot of badass fighting scenes."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,4/10,"After the excellent.....and hilarious.....Thor 3, I was rather looking forward to this. Positive reviews had also whetted the appetite. Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a ""Black Panther tale"" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,"It is too early for April fools day.
These ""critics"" have gone mad if they even think this is best Marvel movie, if you can call it that, such bad job with over hyping it"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,4/10,"The intention and overall message of the movie was noble, but the execution of the movie was not well done. Except for the costumes which were well designed, the script was juvenile, stereotypical and predictable, the pacing was bad, and the scenes were uninspired. The main villain outshone the title character who was rather wooden similar to when he appeared in the previous movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"What a horrible, horrible movie. WAY too long....way too many repetitive fight scenes...ZERO characters you actually cared about...and a plot that seemed to be secondary to everything else. . Michael B. Jordan is one of the worst actors...as with all of the former FNL cast. Save your money...."
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2018,4/10,"The movie frames itself as though the character arc of the protagonist is meant to be the focal point of the movie, while in reality he goes through the whole thing with very little variation or change occurring at all, with motivations so similar to the main antagonist it can be hard to determine why the viewer is meant to root for one over the other. Speaking of the antagonist, this movie's villain is probably the most two dimensional one seen in a Marvel movie to date, with the possible exception of Maliketh. The guy is whiny, arrogant, and, to be honest, stupid. If the movie didn't bend over backwards to force the conflict between him and the protagonist, he wouldn't have accomplished half of what he did in the movie.And on top of all of this, by the end of the movie the only real contribution it makes to the MCU is something that was already established in prior films. In fact, if anything this just presents things that contradict what we already know from movies like Age of Ultron and Civil War."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"After repeatedly hearing about the box office success of this movie, unlike the other Marvel movies in the series I really had no desire to see this one. When I finally did, it just became even more confusing as to the cause of its success. Basically a strange Lion King/Boyz in the Hood style yarn about feuding tribes and families with your oh so stereotypical ""the world done me wrong, I grew up in a rough neighbourhood, your Daddy did my Daddy wrong"" bad guy. Absolutely nothing original about the characters and the overplayed theme of everyone deserves punishment because my ancestors were slaves. With the whole Marvel story line and character base to play with couldn't the director come up with something more original than that. I watched this as it was included in the 'list of movies to watch prior to Infinity War' but honestly.......don't waste your time. It brings absolutely nothing to the MCU and there is nothing missed by not seeing it. People always talk about removing movies from a series canon, well I strongly suggest this is put forward for that privilege. Save your time and money on this cliched pile of junk. I honestly would never watch this movie again."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I loved loved loved this movie. Not as a Marvel movie, but as this epic technicolor tale of the majesty, beauty, and brilliance of the motherland. Yep, it had its cheesy moments and shady CGI. But I could care less. In fact, I am going back this weekend to PAY AGAIN to see it. It was just that moving.Not sure non-Wakandans will get it. But when it was over, I wanted to run to Africa and roll in the soil and scream ""I am home!"" #TrueStory"
BLACK PANTHER,27 December 2018,4/10,Solely a political correct movie made to satisfy the african-american viewers.
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,10/10,I've seen black panther once before and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I went to the local movie theatre for an imax screening on the preview night.I was blown away by what Ryan coogler has created. Wakanda is a visually high tech world set in the midst of Africa. Where t-challa (aka the black panther lives. Even though that this movie is almost 2 1/2 hours long. Every scene clicks like a finger snap. It's just that good. I'd recommend this to anyone. That loves Marvel Studios.
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,6/10,What a lot of nonsense this movie. A lot of beautiful effects and a nice character from Freeman.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,7/10,One of the movies where I started vooting for the villain
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I've seen the movie twice since the February 15th preview, and I most likely will see it a third time before the end of the week. An African-American man, I loved that ""Black Panther"" feature strong, intelligent Black women. I love the action sequences and the well-placed humor. I especially love the director's celebration of African culture and language. Having seen the other movies in the Marvel movie franchise, I think ""Black Panther"" is a very welcome and much needed addition."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2020,10/10,This film is great because it is one of the best representations to date of varied and different black people can be. It also does a good job of rich characters that are not stereotypes of what white society thinks black people are. The film conveys what it looks like when black community works.
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,8/10,That was very cool. I liked the whole African culture meets technology thing. It's a concept that hasn't been done before. All well done.
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,1/10,"The script is poor , overated beyond imagination. I am really confused why is so highly rated."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,I am just giving rating for Chadwick Boseman's performance.
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,10/10,"Great movie and being a Marvel Fan, I loved it and recommend for all to see."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,4/10,"Black panther tells the story of how a man whos name I can neither pronounce nor write becomes king of Wakanda, a fictional African super tech culture. Over the course of about 2 and a half hours the movie really only tells exactly that story. Yes he has to face an evil villain as part of the journey and fight some evil bad guys and all the other standard superhero stuff. But nothing really excites in this movie. His powers are kinda average and meh, the story kinda drags and is pretty meh, the fake dialect is meh and the only thing the characters have going for them is the fact that they are pretty much all black - which to be honest doesn't bother me, but its also not an great argument to like a movie simply because of the casts skin color - but apart from that they are also pretty meh. I did not care one bit for the bad guy. Only interesting character is one of badies played by Andi Serkis.
Black panther was by no means horrible. It had its moments, it has some cool scenes and nice visuals but that is basically it. Nothing is really inspiring, no scene breathtaking and towards the end the movie really starts to drag. Overall, black panther is probably my least favorite of the resent marvel movies. If you want a movie to watch while cooking or cleaning, this is a perfect choice!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2020,10/10,"Marvel's BLACK PANTHER was as hyped as ANY Marvel film. The difference is that it delivered BETTER than the hype & anticipation surrounding it. No Marvel or DC film has brought a level of action, suspense, intellect, surprise and education they way Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler has, period. The Dark Knight Batman is the sole comic film on it's level.Obviously non-Africans and simple comic fans saw no personal connection culturally to BP so it underserved their white privilege of seeing white male heroes in 97% of comics. But for the rest of the planet who saw BP, it scored A's across the board. I respect but whoeheartedly disagree with this poster's review and it's all good, You have 97% of white-led Marvel & DC films to enjoy."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2019,8/10,"Overall, this movie was a good movie. It had a good plot, good story, and very likable and great characters. Is it overrated by the PC critics? I believe it is over-rated and that movies like Dark Knight are far superior. However, this movie had great CGI, interesting and historically archetype characters, and a great morality as well.
Wakanda was done very well and the fantasy city was beautiful. The characters and the ark of the story was very good (although relatively simple). It did remind me slightly of Lion King and that is a good thing. I love the contrast between the two major characters and their morality that is displayed. One has a negative upbringing and chooses the evil route, and one has a privileged upbringing and has more moral decency. I found myself rooting for the character with proper morality and how he displayed his belief in right and wrong even if he had to go against his own family.
The one thing I noticed regarding the reviews is just as some reviewers are complaining because the critics over hype of the movie, I can say that the amount of 1 star reviews are the reverse side of the perversion. On one side, the critics want to drool over the movie for political correctness, and others want to hate the movie without actually rationally considering the movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie would have garnered so many negative reviews if not for the publicity and political hype that has ended up surrounding this movie. In my opinion, this movie falls somewhere between 6-9 rating.In conclusion, this movie was overall good. Good simple yet morally powerful story, and great CGI and backdrop to boot. While not the best superhero movie ever, still a significant and powerful one."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,9/10,"Walking into this film, I'll admit I was rather skeptical. I was hesitant to buy all the hype, because I thought that people liked this movie only because it was the first black main character in the MCU and one of few blockbusters to take place in Africa. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by a dynamic and compelling film with layered themes and intriguing characters that largely sets itself apart from most superhero films. Ryan Coogler, who directs this film brilliantly as expected, creates a fascinating world for the story that is both cultural and innovative. The script is also fantastic, with a concise plot structure and good dialogue. The script establishes complex characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and who all are simply fighting for what they feel is right. What this film accomplishes most impressively is the main conflict between T'Challa and the main villain Killmonger. I was very mad reading reviews that criticized the villain, saying that ""we need to hate the villain, or else we won't root for the hero."" But what this does is create two-dimensional characters and a boring, by the numbers conflict based off simplistic good vs evil. Instead, by providing a sympathetic character with motives we understand and a hero who's flawed, we're simply seeing two human beings in an ideological conflict, similar to the relationship between Joker and Batman in The Dark Knight. Personally, I think this was a great film that I consider one of the best MCU movies I've seen so far (comparible to Civil War, Thor:Ragnarok and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), with compelling characters, brilliant acting and well-executed action scenes. Definitely worth a watch."
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2018,1/10,"Oh My god , this were two and half hours of my life I will never get back . It's a boring movie . 
No story , cliche . Bad cgi ."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,3/10,"There is a lot to say about the direction this movie took but simply put the hype behind them film is just that. The main issues with the film in my opinion are the belowFrom the very beginning the extremely simple core plot line is obvious. Good guy becomes king, evil family member dethrones him and in the end good guy reclaims the throne. It's literally a story we've seen hundreds of times before. Add to that a run time that could have been 30mins shorter and you have a mildly boring film While introducing us to Wakanda and the culture we are told how much tradition and fellowship are what made Wakanda as great a nation as it is. However, towards the end of the film that idea is tossed to the side for plot development. There is a very specific scene where it is stated by Wakandan laws the bad guy should not be king yet all the Wakandans chose to ignore their tradition in favor of the bad guy anyways (ummmm what?). Then you have the issue of race, politics and possibly the worst villain in a marvel movie. Honestly looking at the film in it's completion there is no way anyone should logically agree with Kilmonger in any way. Without giving away spoilers let's just say all his talk of oppression, slavery and being held back due to race has nothing to do with the story we are given. In reality there is only one set of people he should want revenge on but he's simply not smart enough to realize it. In honesty you could remove all the politics/race from this movie and it would not alter it in any way. It seems like Marvel simply added a few lines here and there to appeal to the target demograhic which in this case was under 30 black males.While this film as a stand alone movie was good it simply doesn't live up to what Marvel has built. I simply do not care what happens with Wakanda or if a sequel is made and that's upsetting. Maybe when a sequel is made (you know there will be) Marvel will cut all the politics and give the fans an action packed thrill ride instead of 2+ hours of mind numbing interactions that really mean nothing as a whole"
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,6/10,"Critics are considering it as one of the best MCU movie till date. After watching the movie I am totally baffled by such exaggerated reviews. Puttibg this movie in same pedestal as winter soldier, Iron man, Avengers or Civil War is highly inappropriate.
The movie starts strongly with history of Wakanda and a captivating scene set in past. The world building of Wakanda is impressive in the beginning and it immediately generate interest in this fictional nation. Sad part is all your expectations turn to dissapointment when this movie becomes a generic affair with a very lazy story plot and predictable climax. Character of Shuri as Tachalla's brilliant sister is highlight of the film and rest of the cast is equally good. Movie has veen able to give depth to most of the characters and that is the strongest suits of the film. It is a shame that such characters are reduced to action figures rather than progressing the plot of the film. Film mention various issues faced by colored people which is the key motivation of villain Killmonger. When you expect a well thought off resolution of the central conflict of the film, all you get is punches, kicks and a lazy climax fight sequence. The most interesting premise or conflict raised in a MCU movie after winter soldier (privacy vs security) is resolved with 1 guy in suit fighting with another guy in suit in a cheap CGI battle (remember other numerous other MCU battles). I have no clue how can critics consider it an extremely good movie which will change landscape of superhero movies, it is strictly average at best. Good characters and an interesting premise are wasted and they can only take a movie this far with such a predictable script."
BLACK PANTHER,5 October 2018,8/10,"WOW - what an immersive experience. Everything was perfectly executed from the story arc to the pacing to the CGI. The character delevopment in particular went above and beyond. T'Challa is unquestionably one of my favorite ""Heroes"" now. Bottom line - HOME RUN. Well done Ryan Coogler for delivering such a fun and beautiful movie. He deserves every Oscar that comes his way, and I'm expecting more big things To come."
BLACK PANTHER,8 August 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is amazing in everyway. The story is set up his story very well for future installments and it was nice seeing a film with a majority Black cast. There is an overwhelming amount of movies where the hero is white and its nice to see something different for a change. Killmonger played my Michael B Jordan is a villian i have been waiting to see in the mcu. I was even rooting for the him at times through out the movie. One thing about Black Panther is he set himself apart from other Superheros. Most Superheros work alone but Black Panther was a team player, he wasnt yhe know it all, and just because he was the one in charge he was open to the opinion of his warriors who were women. The women were submissive but strong, smart and ideal. I thought that was awesome.Black Panther is action packed with a very powerful message. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because they did not like it has a majority Black Cast and did better than most Marvel movies. MCU movies like the first Iron Man is waaaaaay over rated. Black Panther runs circles around the majority of marvel movies. The cast starred the best actors and actresses in hollywood. Watch this movie with an open mind. It tells a story about how a lot Black people feel in general. When i went to see this movie people of all races were clapping and enjoying the film. Everyone loved it. Dont listen to the haters and see it for yourself"
BLACK PANTHER,3 December 2019,1/10,"Overhyped and overrated, the only good thing in this movie is costumes. Killmonger was OK as a villain but this movie is nothing more than ""Look we have Politicallly Correct Marvel Movie with Afro Americans"" Cancel the sequel and return us Blade trilogy please cause it was really great movie with really good actors"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,2/10,"I took my nephew to see this today, expecting a wonderful memorable film. Instead, it was dull and full of cliches - a stale rehash. I feel that the critics are afraid to tell the truth about this film because it certainly does not deserve a 98% rating on RT. It's sad that our society cannot be honest about ratings due to fear of ostracization. Usually Marvel heroes use humor to charm the audience, but the Black Panther uses old, worn out cliched formulas. Although it's not a terrible film ,it is certainly not deserving of anything over 50%. There were too many negative racial overtones, and I believe Marvel/Disney need to keep their political ideologies out of the moves. THe visuals were good, but the story line got lost."
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,1/10,"The worst hype ever around this one.1. Cliche laden - Interesting that lots of reviewers say exactly the opposite.
2. No drama - no originality
3. No dialogue whatsoever - framing nonsensical situations (clear from the first scenes).
4. Nonsense script - full of the most boring characters ever written. Engaged in most boring situations throughout the whole film.At least one would expect cool fighting and such. Horrible choreography (blurred and aesthetically not very well coordinated).Very decent CGI/FX.People who made the best superhero movie ever, The Watchmen, please assemble asap. We need your help!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 September 2018,1/10,"Overrated! And critics are afraid to say it. ""Oh you hate Black Panther?"" ""You must be racist"" This is such a racist thing to say. ;)"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,5/10,I couldn't watch it until the end. Some nice ideas and parts but it was just so slow. I love Sci Fi and superhero films but this was not what I expected at all.
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2020,2/10,"97% on Rotten Tomatoes, give me a break.I guess I ""just don't get it"", because I thought this movie was terrible.Suicide Squad gets horrible reviews and it wasn't great, but it was still way better than this garbage.I guess all you have to do is make some incredibly boring movie about fictional black history, and call it a Super Hero movie and woke Hollywood will call it the greatest movie of all time.Sorry, it was HORRIBLE."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"SO Incredibly overhyped!!!! This could have been a B movie if it wasnt in theatres. The was little explanation of the bizarre lore and cool tech. 
the characters behaved in very conventional dramatic comic book ways. 
the humor was uninteresting,
the african-ness of it was ratcheted up to an awkward level. 
Its not the first black superhero movie, Blade and Hancock are only a couple of examples that came before.
frequently confused by story. 
reminds me of lion king. who will be king of africa?
superhero is a mix of high tech iron man suit, spiderman gymnastics, and wolverine claws but adds nothing new.
theyll call you racist if you dont like it. see RT critics reviews"
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,1/10,"This is no different from any marvel movie. The problem is that the characters are weaker and I think the main character is an ineffective xenophobe who worries too much about himself and what his father would have thought of him. The extras were distractingly goofy, and supporting characters were thin and more moral than BP himself. The humor attempts were scatted and lame. The beginning glossed over the origins way too quickly to understand and some of the mysticism around vibranium could have been better explained. Some of their actions didnt make much sense and the screenplay and special effects were a little lacking. I also thought that, for a marvel action movie, their could have been more ACTION. Go see it if you want a forgettable marvel action flick. SJWs wanted a black superhero (hes not the first one though, not even close) and they got it but just like star wars it is terrible. It focuses too much on ""blackness"" and all things sub-Saharan African. Can you imagine if Thor had scenes where he they have futuristic magic Sauna's and ride around in a Viking long ship spacecraft and everyone drank mead?"
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,1/10,"Very disappointed. Even with the plethora of special xf eye-candy I still couldn't stomach the very predictable story line. I only hung in there for the post-credit clips as teaser and link to the upcoming features that continue the story line. BTW, this is now obligatory fare for all MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies. 
A redeeming quality for this movie was the very slight homage and nod to the classic 'Coming to America' vibe. Not sure if younger audiences will even pick that up.
As much as I love and enjoy most of MCU franchises the bitter after taste of the Disney flavoring ('It's a small world theme' that is consistently Disney) is really starting to annoy me. sigh..."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,3/10,"Good idea to place 'Something Good' in Africa. Now take the idea and make a good story. Huh? Lets just mix&match visual effects and feel-good myths about (good) Africa and the (bad) western world. Good looking actors do the rest.How is the leader of the most advanced technological society in the world chosen? Of course, by a fight to the death! The survivor gets absolute power. That results in a peaceful, diverse society (tribal of course), women are empowered (the leaders are men of course).Strange mix of movie cliches with deep wishes from the PC squad packed in a visually appealing 3D movie."
BLACK PANTHER,20 January 2020,6/10,Michael B. Jordan and Martin Freeman ruined this movie.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"Because of the amazing reviews, I went in expecting a masterpiece. I like the acting alot and Michael B. Jordan clearly steals the show. The cinematography was great, the costumes were absolutely gorgeous. I really like the casting choices for this film and thought they were all great. Angela Bassett was also amazing as well as Forest Whitaker!So what didn't I like about it? I wish the story had been worked on a little more. Here is what I mean, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen next. It was very play by play.Some of the visual effects were amazing and some were a little off. The last fight between Killmonger and Black Panther seemed a little repetitive and boring. I expected to see Black Panther have a little more action throughout the film also being a superhero and not fighting so much without his powers. I was left hoping for a little more. But the film is still a fun experience and I recommend everyone watch it at least once - especially if you like superheros."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,9/10,"The film was great. It's nice to have a marvel movie where it isn't making you like it because it has ""guest"" superheroes. The both villains are great, one had a strong reason that the world turned against him and wanted to strike back. And the other villain was just a maniac that wanted to make money and have fun doing it. I think they're way better than any of Iron Mans film villains. The ost was good as well. Great marvel movie introducing the main characters world. The story gave him a depth and understanding that only certain marvel superheroes have (like Thor, and Starlord, Captain America). As for the goofball that made the review Michel, buddy don't waste your time watching a film you don't like, let alone don't math to figure out the statistics of every review that has submitted a review on IMDb. Get a hobby."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2019,3/10,"After reading so many bad reviews I didn't bother to watch this film but i was running out of films to watch!
I wish I never bothered i stopped half way in. Bad lines crappy storyline acting was ok but trying to get a film by on African/ jamaican dress and rubbish protocol failed badly.
Worst superhero film I have seen ever bar none. Bored"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,8/10,"This is one of the best marvel films. I enjoyed it far more than doctor strange, ant man or any of the post Maguire spider man films. It has so much character and depth! I loved the African culture, it was such a refreshing change of scenery and characters and story. Before seeing the movie I thought I was all the social justice warriors over hyping it for some racial brownie points. I was wrong and the good reviews are genuine and reliable. I watched this movie at 9.45pm since being awake at 4am and was gripped! The last Jedi couldn't keep me awake in the same scenario. Black panther has never been a super that grabbed my attention as a kid but I think it's ace after seeing the movie.8 stars as it could have been a little tidier in places jumping around a little at the beginning. However this is forgotten quickly and you quickly become engrossed in the excellent characters marvellous scenery and pumping soundtrack!"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"I saw this film last night. I found the first half hour pretty slow, but it eventually got going and I found myself enjoying it slightly more than I had anticipated.1. Special Effects: Good, with a few very good parts, especially in a couple of the vision scenes. 2. Acting: All characters were well cast, keeping with Marvel's record (in my opinion). Very impressed with Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa. He is believable as a king new to the throne and a man with a good heart who wants to be a good ruler. There was good interaction between him and his cousin, too.3. Story: Average, as stated above, it took a while before I really got into it, probably the longest out of any of the MCU movies.4. Humour: Classic MarvelI rate this film 7/10. It is good fun. I will probably watch again in the future, but I'm in no rush."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,5/10,Too much hype killed this movie. I kept hearing this was Marvel's best movie to date... it isn't. Plain and simple. It was okay. But I wouldn't even put it up there in Marvel's Top 5 movies to date.
BLACK PANTHER,1 September 2020,7/10,"Black Panther is a superhero movie, that binds sci-fi, comedy, and action nicely. It's what makes this movie so great. Everything ties so well together. The Violence isn't very bad compared to other action movies, there are stabbings throughout though. But most of them are in low detail. Characters do get impaled, but then again it looks fake (Looks like someone took a spear split it in half, and glue the ends between the person with red dyed glue). There are tons of explosions, a few shootings with armed or weak armed people. It is more violent than any other movie from marvel (if we exclude the Rated R ones) from the last 5 years, but it's a great deal. Only a few kissing and make outs and nothing more. Men are shirtless, but for tribal reasons, and never sexual. The action scenes get pretty tense, tight, understanding, shocking and emotional. That is something you might want to look out for other than violence for young ones but It's a MUST SEE, WATCH IT!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,10/10,"I've seen this movie twice. The first time around I thought the movie was good, but not as good as what everybody claimed it to be. I think my opinion at that moment was due to the fact that I had walked into the movie late and missed the opening scenes. The second time around, however, I got to see the opening to the storyline which drew me in. There were moments in the movie that had went over my head the first time that I watched it, that I finally understood on the second trip.I liked the vibrant colors in this movie. The outfits and the design of the characters were really impressive. I liked how they modernized tribal-looking things and blended it with technology. One scene that really stood out to me was when T'Challa was walking out of the spacecraft onto the top of the waterfall to be celebrated by the Wakandans' singing. Then the camera pans upward to show all of the people welcoming him home. I was impressed by M'baku coming out of the cave inside the waterfall and I thought his mask looked really cool. That opening fight scene really drew me in. Chadwick Boseman is a very good actor, as well as Michael B. Jordan, and Winston Duke. I think the whole cast including Lupita N'yongo, Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright were perfect for the movie and very convincing. If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the scene where Killmonger and T'Challa were fighting while still falling. It was like Killmonger was so determined to destroy T'challa that he didn't pay attention to the height that he was falling. Killmonger had so much anger built up in him and he did EVERYTHING (""I waited my entire life for this"") just to be able to take T'Challa down. Although, Killmonger was RUTHLESS and a cold-blooded killer he was very relatable. How many of us have been the underdog, been done wrong or have had almost everything taken from us? I think many African-American's can really relate to that because of the past mistreatment that their ancestors have faced and some still face today. I think it's not only relatable to African-American's but to any race in everyday situations. How many of us can also say that we have not desired retribution, or just wanting to get back on top? I think that's something a lot can relate to. My criticisms of this film would be that they should have kept Killmonger alive and just made him join forces with the Wakandan's. I think Michael B. Jordan was so convincing and I think if they really want the next Black Panther to be good they should keep his character. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan were the main characters that kept the audience glued to the screen. My advice to Ryan Coogler is to keep Killmonger in. By the way Ryan Coogler is an awesome director. Oh, and another critique before I go is that, they should have did more with the soundtrack. I mean go really hard with the music and blend even more of the African, tribal sounds with the hard trap beats. Overall good movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,5/10,"In my three years and nine months as a memeber this will be my first review. I actually just have Imdb as a checklist so I can remember what I have seen.This movie disappointed me. Tedious and political. There were so many times I thought ""Oh now the good part comes.... oh well maybe now.... or now...."" but it never really came. It had such a great cast and it had such potential. To be fair the acting didn't bother me so much. The story is a real snorefest. When they make a sequel it better be perfect or the franchise will be dead."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,4/10,"It's not as good as people are saying it is, it's a boring dull and uninspired Marvel movie that pales in comparison to the last three Marvel films which were for the most part decent fun films. Everything that made the last three Marvel films fun and entertaining are gone from this one. Black Panther tries to way more serious in tone taking on a more mature story and in the process fails miserably putting itself on an equal footing with films like Ant Man and the second Iron Man movie. It's not awful but chances are you won't be remembering this after a couple days.Funny enough the plot for this film is an almost beat for beat carbon copy of Thor Ragnarok (extra points for originality!) which I liked, you've got the son of a great king finding out that his father ain't all that great of a guy, you've got the blood relative that comes to usurp the throne that is originally bestowed upon the main guy, the main guy meets daddy in Marvel hell and gains the mojo he needs to beat up the big baddy, main guy takes the aid of an army force and takes back the throne. The similarities even extend to the main guy teaming up with his likeable funny sibling that everyone loves. Now if these two films have so much in common then how come one of ems a steaming pile of mediocrity? Taika Waititi realized that Thor is a dumb character and that no one wants to see another Thor 1 or 2 and instead aimed for a lighthearted fun comedy action film that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't unlike BP. It's the banter and character interactions within Thor Ragnarok that elevate it above an average Marvel film, Waititi is aware that you can't create a serious Dark Knight esque film about a character like Thor without deviating from the generic Marvel formula and having it come out as a tonally inconsistent forgettable mess. BP is in essence, a dry bland boring version of TR that misses out on the interesting likeable characters and humor that made TR great.Visuals were okay except for the CG which was laughable especially during fight scenes, speaking of fight scenes the choreography felt very lackluster. The pacing for the first half or so of the film felt very sluggish. The bloodless brutality was strange, I get that its PG-13 but I mean come on. Characters in this film were mostly forgettable despite most performances being solid. The best character in the film Andy Serkis is killed off early on to help further MBJ's plot. Some characters felt pointless Daniel Kaluuya's role felt like a cheap segway into Michael B Jordan's character Kilmonger. Another generic Marvel villain who I can't for the love of god understand why people care for. His garbled motivations and nonsensical plans were laughable and I couldn't take his name, backstory, or really anything seriously.I don't want to sound like I hated this film, It's just extremely mediocre. The most I can speak of for positives is the films soundtrack and even then it isn't even implemented that well into the film, the soundtrack that was advertised all over the trailers is sorely underused and its a damn shame. That and the fusion of traditional African into the films score was nice. That's about it.I give this 4 gas station beef patties /10"
BLACK PANTHER,24 July 2021,3/10,This movie rate is a joke! What so good about it?! It's a super hero movie that's all nothing different! Unless you see it from different view not as a movie view. Definitely 100% over rated move! I don't know what so different that everyone went crazy about it! It's a nice move and ok story that's all!
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"What's good: The power packed action sequences and graphics give you a visual bonanza that warrants a positive rewiew when you leave the theatre. The 3D effects make it even more stunning!! Get ready to dive into the mystical world of Wakanda, with their picturesque landscapes, vibranium modified animals, unique rituals, and...... Wierd looking people.
What's not really good: The storyline would have been awesome, if you hadn't seen it, like a thousand times. No efforts to make to make it even a little bit less cliche. And the black panther seems like a distant cousin of the batman, you know with the technology and stuff.
I think you have better acting potential with some of the antagonists. Personally I feel Michael jordan leaves a better impact that anybody else.
What you have to do: Go to a facny theatre,take your girlfriend, grab some popcorn, take a cozy seat, , give your intellectual Nazi's some rest, and just watch. Yes.its okay if you dont have a girlfriend."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,5/10,"It's really overrated. For me the movie content is just enough to say ""fine"" not excellent. The message release were black supreme, war criticism. But not any outstanding meaning that I remember so far. The Black Panther (The King) hasn't shown any different or extraordinary features, They're originally human, nothing without the secret recipe to become Black Panther, anyone can become.
Even the romantic side is ignored totally ,not giving any feelings. 
Nothing special to remember."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,6/10,"Considering the hype of this movie, I was disappointed. Nice graphics. The lead women of the movie (girlfriend, sister and general) were by far the most interesting characters. A lot of it is corny."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,8/10,"Great fun, sweet storyline, excellent acting, beautiful special effects and costumes. Loved it to bits, can't understand previous negative reviews."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,1/10,What a waste of time! No substance. I would rather watch Paddington 2. I hope they don't waste money on a sequel. Marvel should stick to the more important super heroes which most of us like. Ant-Man was great!
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"The non traditional Marvel Fan got an eyeful of beauty, style and culture as the backdrop to a long anticipated Superhero's story who not until now got to see the big screen. For the traditional Marvel Fan, I'm sure there wasn't enough fighting, crashing, noise and conflict going on to satisfy today's adrenaline addiction but if they could allow themselves to shift, they would realize what in fact they are experiencing isn't just a movie, but a whole culture that is foreign to a lot of us in America. The calmness of the characters, the steely keenness of their strategy and cool collected demeanor are all new. If you can appreciate that, you can appreciate every aspect of this film as a work of Art and something that young and old everywhere will remember for generations like the early days of Superman. Black Panther isn't just a Superhero Action Film, it is the beginning of the mythology of a Legend."
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2019,8/10,"I don't know how many times have I heard that it should have got Oscar but after finally catching up with it, it has its moments but not much new on the superheroes market."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,6/10,"This movie was overhyped. It checked all the boxes but I left the theatre feeling unimpressed. I don't think the character development was there and frankly, the start of the movie felt cheesy. I was hoping for much more based on all the hype around this movie but that's all it is - hype. Thor Ragnorak was much better! That movie deserves all the hype and delivers! Same for Wonder Woman!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Finally a refreshing marvel film which takes many social, racial & political messages into consideration and not to mention - brilliant acting, action, and scenery."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,9/10,"Yes I know I'm just supposed to do only Made in Naija movie reviews, but I can't help it in this one! Besides, there was enough reference to Nigeria in this movie, so here we are! I saw the most hyped movie of this time, Black Panther, and I loved it! There is actually nothing to hate in this movie! I am not really a fan of science fiction and fantasy movies, I mean, I love the X-Men franchise, but that does not mean that I jump to the cinema as soon as they release a new movie every week.But Black Panther is different! It is obvious that these people sat down and did their homework well. I mean, I did not find any fault with the movie! And that is the best thing about the movie. It was like the creators of the movie were ready for any movie critic; they left no stone unturned. Beautiful working storyline, amazing location (and if it was a studio work, the special effects team deserve an Oscar), lovely, lovely costumes! (I mean, Lupita actually wore Ankara!), the soundtrack too cannot be compared to another, especially during the fighting scenes. And they did not use the same score for two fights. One score, one fight. (Yes I pay so much attention to details) I mean, Marvel outdid themselves in this one!This is a good place to stop right? Before I will start sounding like a sell out. But there is no movie without characters right? We have to talk about them! TChalla, the king of Wakanda and the Black Panther himself brought his A game to this one! He commanded so much screen presence that I just wanted to see him in all scenes. That said. Michael Jordan is one very sexy villain I have not seen in a very long time! I mean, the first time he appeared on screen, he was stealing. But every girl at the cinema screamed when he appeared. Yes! I heard them. Other cast members are Lupita as Nakia, the object of the king's affection, Angela Basset as Queen Mother Ramonda, Forrest Whittaker as the king's spy. But the character that brought life to Wakanda is bald headed Okoye, the king's general. Played by new comer Danai Gurira. Girl's got some badass moves when fighting!Yes! Black Panther is the most hyped movie of this time; but the movie is worth all the hype. It has something for everybody - scifi, drama, African heritage, basketball, comedy, ceremonies, action, gun fight, etc. But a little lacking in the romance department. I did not mind a bit though...If you have not watched it, please go and watch it. Not for anything; just to feel among we cool kids that have watched the movie and to tell people that you have also watched what is perhaps the greatest movie in 2018."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"I was a bit wary to write a bad review about this nonsense film as I felt I ought to, it was that bad. I was expecting racist accusations if I openly condemned it, as it's full of messages. Thank god I am not alone in hating this rubbish. Black Panther my arse. worst Marvel film ever. Dont bother!"
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,9/10,"I find it strange that people believe the plot is complicated. If you aren't a total idiot, you can understand the nature of this film. While it does remind me of the Lion King, and while I wish there had been more scenes of Black Panther using his super abilities and in his actual attire, overall the movie's direction was smart. It wasn't just a super hero movie. Social and cultural themes were woven into it, giving Black Panther a more developed character. The visuals were stunning and ALL of the supporting characters were developed. It was more than just a Marvel movie. It was just a movie all its own.I don't understand why there can't be superhero movies that are a little serious just like this. Many people constantly talk about how the other movies were funny. But let's think about the original comics. They weren't all riddled with corny jokes. There were some funny scenes and such, but why can't super hero movies cause controversy as well? If this had been a story about other controversies, relative to other races of people, no one would feel this movie was ""unrelatable"". Captain America Winter Soldier had a deeper story line than some of the others, and was more thought-provoking than other Marvel movies. This movie gives a similar flavor. Still, does a movie need humor to be good? I don't think so. Still, if that's what you're looking for, the seriousness of the theme can cloud out the humor at many points of the story.Yet, I would like to move beyond the backstory in the future and actually see the super hero in his essence, in his suit, saving others' lives. But I'm sure we'll get there. This movie was the perfect stepping-stone for that."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,9/10,"While most Marvel movies are known for the high-packed action and simplistic story telling, Black Panther attempts to be thought-provoking and intelligent. It wove together cultural and social themes, themes that people today are becoming afraid of, themes that are unique to the super hero and Marvel universe.The only Marvel movie that was this intelligent was Captain America Winter Soldier. The movie was exciting, all of the characters were excellently developed and showed many layers, from the hero, to the sidekicks, to the villain. The story itself might remind people of The Lion King, but if one is familiar with many African cultures, the Lion King wasn't just inspired from Hamlet, but also African story-telling as well. Black Panther came out LONG before The Lion King. Still, because most people have heard such storytelling, it's hard not to find the cliche in this film. Honestly, it's getting hard to avoid cliches in general. What haven't we seen, as movie-goers? Black Panther stuck to a solid backstory and it works for the film.The only people who may not relate to this movie are people who have never been colonized or taught to empathize with people. Of course, this movie would relate to black people and people of color who understand the messages. But I found it strikingly interesting the amount of people who disliked the movie because they couldn't relate to the message or they felt the racial undertones were negative. I actually felt that made the movie carry more substance. And if anyone can empathize at all with people who are different, they would realize the themes of the movie aren't to different from any other story about warriors. My one drawback with the movie is that I didn't see enough of Black Panther in his element. He wasn't wearing his attire very often and he didn't save regular civilians. He saved his kingdom, but other people were rarely the focus.The weakness of other Marvel films, this movie had as a strength. The strengths of the other Marvel films were not present in this movie. Of course, I prefer a movie with a measure of depth as a opposed to mindless action and one-liner jokes."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,6/10,The movie was ok. i wouldn't watch it again. Pretty good plot good acting. Good Movie
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2018,10/10,"One of the best marvel movies I've ever seen, great story with excellent actors."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,5/10,"Really one of the ugliest blockbluster i'v seen in a while.
They mostly should be ashamed of the first action sequence
The rest is kind of okay to cringey.Really not a ""good"" movie"
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,"After hearing the critic reviews for this show, I though this title would walk on water. Story is really odd and far fetched even for a super hero comic based movie. Action scenes are good in spots. I love a good super hero flick but this felt like it was trying to hard to be racially charged. Just for the purpose of being racially charged."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Its emotionally epic in every sense of the world!
BLACK PANTHER,14 October 2018,8/10,"This movie is way more interesting than the latest Avengers and the Iron Man sequels. Can't understand the low 1 star ratings. Surely not a 1 star. Predictable parts in the movie sure, but just about every action movie these days suffers story telling for special affects. Black Panther, by comparison to other Marcel films, the audience could actually care about the characters what happened to them. Good film with depth not often found in these types of films."
BLACK PANTHER,10 February 2019,2/10,Don't like it don't like it don't like don't like it
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is another not only MCU triumph, but a Comic book movie triumph. Chadwick Boseman give live to T'Challa and The Black Panther. He is yet another example of the amazing choice for casting lead MCU roles. The rest of the cast shines in every moment, from the main support cast to the little roles and cameos. Michael B. Jordan is as Killmonger is one of the best MCU and Comic book movies villains of all time. His motives are clear and relatable. He is used in the right way and where he is needed to. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as the main women of the film execute their roles in an spectacular way. They are selfaware, bold in ther choices and fun to watch. It was very pleasing to see that Freeman get a more deep role through the movie than just a short cameo. Andy Serkis made Klaw crazy and unpredictable, and a very good second villain for the movie. But one of the most terrific things in the movie is the representation of Wakanda. It looks and feels alive. Every shot is an art. Accompanied by the soundtrack it increase the richness of Wakanda and its mythology.The movie only flaw is that it doesn't have much of a turning points. It's pretty straight forward. Maybe there are one or two, but not on the level, let say of Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. However this doesn't hinder the great story of the movie and its narrative. There is some noticeable at the 3rd act, but it's doesn't take you away from the action in any way.
Black Panther is another solid entry for the MCU. It feels different and for the most of it's parts self contained(for a 18th MCU movie). We can hope to see the greatness of T'Challa yet again in Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,10/10,"Whoever is reading this, please believe the reviews that are on rotten tomatoes and not the reviews that have been posted here by different users. Clearly those reviews have been posted based on a certain agenda and that is to degrade a marvel movie. Me and my wife went to watch this movie and we both found it extremely engaging, entertaining and fulfilling. It was filled with action, the story was great, the villain did an excellent job, all the actors portrayed their parts perfectly and there was a bit of humor in there. Me and my wife both loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone who wants to watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,,"Had to make the movie ""political"", which ruined it for me, along with too much bad CGI. Poor acting, boring story. Movie way overrated! One of the worst Marvel movies ever."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Wow it's fantastic and get your emotions involved too, just couldn't ask for a more perfect movie. The whole team Africa theme and the the acting was special! Go and see this movie and you will not only want to be black panther but you will want to visit Africa! 10000 starrrsss I give it.... CGI is stunning btw..."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"GRADE : A
Favorite characters: SHURI. OKOYE. KILLMONGER. M'BAKU
This is highly recommended, I was scared that it won't live up to the hype but it did and exceeded it. the acting was pure excellent, Danai's character okoye was the greatest of them all. She was so powerful I could just feel it. ""Would you kill me, my love?"" moment was truly thrilling I just loved it. Her loyalty and skills as a leader and a warrior are just amazing. I might be a bit biased with Jordan as Killmonger because I love him so much but his acting was beautiful, I think I preferred his suit over the panther's. The golden tiger print on it is so nice and that scene when he transformed was just so smooth the cgi was amazing. Shuri.. oh shuri, Wright was perfect for this role. Funny, witty, intelligent and overall protective of her brother and mother, she is one of my favorites. M'Baku's character was simply brilliant and very funny, I loved his loyalty and honor. Him saving T'Challa was one of my favorite moments. His throne room was also one of my favorites, how it's built and how his throne is built was both amazing. T'Challa's character was also amazing but he was a bit overshadowed by the rest of the great cast. I can't wait for infinity war to see all those characters together and especially to see a stand off between Stark, Banner and Shuri.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ""if u havent seen it idk what are u even doing right now"""
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,1/10,"As of may 2018 with a rating of 7,6 (...WHAT?!?)
You may ask yourself;
How does this movie gets such a high rating??? What kind of people gave this such a high rating?? Is this voted in the same corrupt way as a presidential election?Acting; they tried but failed, some of the ghetto slang was really out of place at times.
Story; lame and honestly kind of stupid, mediocre even for teenager audience.
Plot; very predictable, again; better suited for a teenager audience (sorry to insult the teenagers :-)
Scenery; the badly done mix of touristy African kind of culture with SF style is really disconcerting, it hurts my eyeballs....Black Panther is a very-very mediocre comic book movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2019,,Black panther was an very good movie worth the watch
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"So after reading many of the reviews on here I can simply describe some of them as ""hate"". 
1) Politics, yes its political the main character is a king so to rule his kingdom politics has to be involved.
2) Its a Superhero movie you go into it KNOWING the good guy will survive in the end.
3) Yes the current climate in America takes a form in the movie, because the movie takes place present day and these are REAL problems that face many Americans.4)This is Marvel's best origin story followed closely by Iron Man and Ant Man. Since we were introduced to Black Panther in Civil War we finally get to see his homeland and how the Black Panther is chosen.5) I can't remember too many other Marvel films showing villain development the way this one does. We learn more about the villain in this movie (though briefly) we at least know the bad guy didn't just pop-up out of no where.6) There was plenty of action though the movie does have some slow parts, but so do a lot of movies.7) The comedic timing is great, not Deadpool level, but a little better than the other MCU movies."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"Here's a few reasons you should watch this:
Well written.Good special effects.Interesting characters.More genuinely tense moments than most MCU films.Good story line.But most importantly:
An actually good and interesting villain with more than 1 dimension to his character. Conclusion -> Go watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,6/10,"First and foremost, overall I thought the movie was pretty solid. It will keep you entertained and the cast is great except for one actor...Michael B Jordan. He plays the villain in this marvel movie and this is where my rating went from an 8 to a 6. Maybe it wasn't so much the actor but the writing? I just don't know but no one in their right mind watching this can tell me lines like ""when I tell you to do something, I mean that sh**!"" or any other forced west side slang really fit in to this role. I get he's supposed to be from Oakland but everything he said seemed so out of context. Daniel Kaluuya (main actor in Get Out), also casted in this movie, would've been a much better villain and maybe the two should've switched characters...overall the movie is good but the more Michael b Jordan talks, the more disappointed I get. 6/10"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,2/10,"Im going to keep it short and sweet.The movie is not even close to being one of the best Marvel movies, is predictable and the CGI - Fx are ""fake "" as you can imagine. Plot and villain are weak and nothing memorable.Finally to put this movie on pair with The Grandfather - Star wars - The Dark Knight or even other MCU movies, shows how rotten Hollywood and the critics are- Im guessing they dont want to be label as racist for saying how crappy this movie truly is."
BLACK PANTHER,6 February 2019,6/10,"An Oscar nomination? WTF? This against the other Oscar worthy pictures such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, etc. Yes, WTF actually. And it made loads of money probably due to the fake good reviews and hype. I have enjoyed other Marvel movies much more, and still, none of them deserved any Oscar nominations. WTF again. All I liked about this movie was the cool technology and gadgets they had. That's about it. Everything else is so forgettable. And I just read the Michael B. Jordan had to do counseling after he played the role of the Lillian? ROFLMAO. I can't take it anymore! (And no, I am not white.)"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I've waited for this move since I first began collecting comic books over 30 years ago. A black super hero with a backstory.
The movie dragged and I became unamused that this seemingly futuristic society was relegated to solving its problem with black-on-black violence. 
The back story would have been better if it was not based on Anglo Christian shakesperean overtures. 
The message of embracing technology was welcome and the dream/visual of a home that could have been was overwhelming."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2018,4/10,"At the end of this film I was relieved it was over. At the end of Les Mis I wanted to man the barricades and fight for Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. 
What a lost opportunity."
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,8/10,"I enjoyed this movie. Of course I say this because I have a Real Life, and I am not caught up in a Fantasy World of my own making. Most of the Bad Reviews are from people who are DEEP into a fantasy world and do not look at a film like this for what it is, It is a FILM !! Not Real Life. No matter what was done they were going to go into the minutia of every aspect. See it and make your own Judgments."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"IMDB has been my source of information about movies eversince, and I usually go through the reviews first before I watch a movie. Before seeing BP, 
I was a lil worried because there has just been so many poor ratings given to this movie but on the other hand I was thinking maybe people just really hate to see black people excel and shine as a superhero.I watched it this afternoon here in the Philippines and i could say that there are just too many haters here on IMDB trying to put down this one emotional thriller! I'm no expert in movies but BP has a great message that it wants to convey not just politically or racially but also depicting what it truly means to be a leader whom people look up to and taking a stand to what the past mistakes of other people will cost your leadership in the present. This movie will also serve as an inspiration to black people who for the longest time has been depicted as thugs, gangsters an the like. BP is someone black kids will look up to and will open their eyes and give them hopes that they too belong in this world and can be a hero of their own.This is my first ever review and I'm no expert critic and I don't know how to review a movie based on its technical aspects but I could personally say that this one is an enjoyable movie and deserves to be recommended. Ignore the bad reviews! watch this truly EMOTIONAL THRILLER!"
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,4/10,"After all the hype, I've finally managed to view a title I've put off for a long time for several reason. Those reasons being me fearing the movie would be a big clich√© and an overhyped piece of Marvel fanboying. After watching the movie, I feel sad I actually gave it a chance.The whole plot of the movie is paperthin and feels like it's been based on a children's movie or Disney's Lion King gone live action. Introduction of the movie feels sloppy, as some people get a lot of camera action and backstory and others don't. After a good 10 minutes of the movie, you kind have realised how the story is going to turn out. You can recognize the bad guy, you can imagine the story and you can tell importance of persons in the story just from the lines they get. The overall cohesion of the movie is very low. CGI doesn't look all too good and forced. The dialogues are terrible and could've been written by a 10 year old and all the clich√©s that can occur in a superhero movie do occur. (Spoilers) The superhero gets chosen but is uncertain of himself. He get's defeated and learns he isn't the best but is still better than injustice. He stands up and defeats the bad guy. Wow, this is a plot we've never seen before Marvel. Just because you happen to put black people in it and a bad interpretation of African culture, this movie doesn't distinguish itself. This movie doesn't even cover a lot of black culture. It just has black actors speaking horrible English, saying cliche lines and living up to African stereotypes. The overall sound mixing of the movie is also terrible. I kind of like Kendrick, but all of the sounds in this music consist of this one beat of a Kendrick track being played over and over, which I thought was pretty weak. There are a lot of other black rappers, musicians who could've been useful and maybe given this a real African vibe, instead of a (clich√©) American one. To conclude, this movie just was exactly the disappointing pile of crap I expected. The story did not suprise/impress me at any point, nor did the visuals or the composition of the movie. If you love the superhero genre, you might like this movie but I certainly did not. For me it was just a story heard many times before, given a bad African vibe by some Hollywood people who wanted to make a movie that would be political correct without taking to much actual diversity on hand; trying to please the big crowd as much as they could with a storyline a child could follow and replay at school. I sure hope Infinity war is beter."
BLACK PANTHER,8 April 2018,1/10,"Marvel did everything they could to get this movie looking as good as it could on paper: cool trailers, Kendrick soundtrack, and critical acclaim (through possible bribery). They went all out on the marketing side. But they forgot about the most important part. The movie.This movie is broken and although I could write a long breakdown of how broken it is, others have already done this exceedingly well. And frankly, I don't want to spend anymore time thinking about this overhyped marketing play.In summation, Marvel did everything they could to make this movie seem great, besides making a good movie..."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,7/10,Everyone saying that this movie is overrated. I agree to that the story is mediocre theres no any surprisesor any twists or nothing but its kinda good when backgrounds are considered it's really gorgeous. I really like African movie backgrounds. But I really hoped for more. The last battle went kinda cheesy when 5 or 4 girls fighting ths the bad guy when the main character is fighting with rhinos(Sorry for spoilers). But it's not that bad I liked it. A small advice don'tget your hopes up. But better than Justice League ;-)
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Don't believe the negative reviews, the movie is awesome!Does it have a good amount of action? YES
Is the movie too long or slow? NO
Are the characters awesome? YES (though a little generic)
Is the cinematography great? YES
Is the set design terrific? YES
Does it have a good story? IT DEPENDS The story is probably the weakest aspect because it's not really new (but let's be honest, new stories are rare, everything is somehow a variation of something). Many things are predictable (like in other Marvel movies) but that doesn't spoil the fun. The mixture of traditional African influences with modern technology is awesome though. Some ignorant person called Africa a ""sh*thole"", this movie is a prophetic re-imagining of Africa.I wish some characters would have had more screen time but you can't have it all.Now go and see the movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,8/10,"I went into Black Panther expecting that it would be good, but I didnt know what was in store for me.First off, Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was Amazing. Best Marvel Villian by far.
And we can't forget the rest of the cast.
Chadwick Boseman was amazing as expected, Andy Serkis was brilliant as usual and Letia Was Amazing as Shuri.She is my favourite Character in the MCU By Far.The action was Fantastic, the acting was on point. The story was surprisingly dark but uplifting at the same time.The only thing that would let it down was the CGI. Some of it looked of at the end of the movie but it didnt bother me all that much.I really recommend going to see Black Panther
Can't wait for Sequel!"
BLACK PANTHER,25 January 2019,10/10,"Ignore the negative reviews and comments. The popularity and box office appeal has drawn out a contingency of people who have nothing better to do.Performances, set design, direction are all stellar and truly deserving of Oscar consideration."
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2020,,"Couldn't have picked a worse actor than Michael B Jordan, misappropriated and overemphasized street attitude that severely detracted from the role. This combined with comments that bore serious racist underpinnings ruined a lot of the movie.Pretty much all other actors were fantastic though, albeit part of the MCU, the Black Panther was a miss among a an otherwise linear progression of films."
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,4/10,"Look, I am a huge fan of superhero movies, comic book movies. I love most Marvel movies and The Dark Knight trilogy. I also need to state that I am not a racist, and that I have nothing against an all African American cast. In my book, what matters most to me about a movie is- is it good? Is it entertaining? Is there something original?
Black Panther is not one of the good movies. It's not a good superhero movie and definitely not a good movie overall. It lacks originality as well as a good quality plot, acting is fine but nothing special, no good characters except maybe the villain, but he is nothing special. 
Overall - this movie is so overrated and overhyped it's almost unbearable, just because an all black cast."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,8/10,"This movie isn't merely a superhero film. This is a strong cultural representation that which typically becomes ignored unless tragedy or near-savagery are openly displayed upon the screen. The film is a good opening saga towards a character whom was introduced to the cinematic in Captain America: Civil War. Quite sadly, I did not care for the character in that display of him. Though, in the solo film, I'm a strong-holding fan of his & the movie, in general.No, I can not say that the film is flawless. To textually or vocally utter such is nonsensical. Though, the film attempts to not only give a better display of the character, it fully wants to enlist interested visitors towards his nation(for those of whom are tech fans). It does not display fully women to the utmost regard(nor does it disrespects women of any means), but it channels the energy enough to fully do such in the next film(T'Challa's Sister, Shuri, is his primary tech/weapons developer/designer). It's villain, intriguingly, is properly played with the character housing the same quasi-discontent for his ""motherland"" as which is generally shown in a reverse accord in real life.The means that the spiritual magic plays a strong, yet small, underbelly towards the technological shock is, oddly, great. The film would've been too bogged down if that was fully shown, yet the next one holds the aspect of going even further with that concept seeded into the story. It showcases that there is more than the 'Marvel'ous advanced tech that the country holds dear; it connects towards it's rooting cultural basis, as well.Hopefully, this could become a stand-alone trilogy whilst the primary character houses a good role within Infinity War saga, or even after such. There is a firm basis laid & we can see that the panther has a growl, if we can see him complete pounce or maul(I'm metaphorically regarding, mind you) while retaining his intelligence, then we could see one of the best comic book to film series thus far. Right now, though, we have a really decent movie that most can enjoy, regardless of race & comic book fandom."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,This is a great movie with great acting!! The story flows well and the actors do a great job of delivering touching memorable scenes. Michael B Jordan is one of the best villains in the MCU. Don't cheat yourself from an enjoyed time because of the misguided fake reviews of angry people. Great Movie!!! Top 3 in the MCU!!!!
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,9/10,"While everyone told me the movie was fairly good I was too busy watching My Hero Academia, so it took me a while to finally watch it. Once I did I was genuinely impressed. It provides the same charm of an MCU movie while also having originality from the rest of the MCU movies. Now the reason for the title selection of my review is that no matter how many complaints there are, saying that it was a sucky movie with a really boring plot, they are still outvoted by me and the rest of the good votes. Additionally, most of the critics see it as a good film. I even took time to vote it myself, even though I rarely do so, because I felt disappointed at the bad reviews. WAKANDA FOREVER (sorry. Had to do it.)"
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2019,4/10,"Once the acting settled in it got better. Michael B. Jordan is as good as always, of course Forrest Whitaker was good as he is in everything, so was Andy Serkas. Terrible acting for everyone else. Atrocious. Although it got better overall over the course of the film. The writing was bad. The scene where T'Challa is fighting for the crown and his sister yells out ""come on T'Challa"" was cringeworthy in that the line didn't fit and more so the delivery was awful.Hard to get past the first 45 minutes, but ok after that. I put four other Marvel movies lower, and then this one. So it's like ninth best."
BLACK PANTHER,18 August 2018,1/10,"An embarrassment for all involved.
Cringe worthy 'plot', poorly acted.
Cultural appropriation isn't a phrase is generally use, but in this case, the cap really does fit."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,6/10,"I really enjoy superhero movies. The earlier ones where they talked less and had great scenes of actionBlack Panther just lacked the action. The last Thor was also a disappointment. So much talking, so little action."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,4/10,"We planned the whole day just to go watch this movie. We had great expectations based on what many people were saying about the cultural influences it has. But no, it was not as expected. The characters felt forced into the story, the director forgot to give us some feelings about them to at least try to engage into their backgrounds and stories. The rituals part were not deep at all. No explanations about certain events; Whitaker's character was there because it had too. It seemed he represented part of the identity of the city but nothing was mentioned about it.The African culture could have been beautifully represented by the music and Environments other than just the clothes and characters themselves. As a whole, it is a movie to be entertained by during a Saturday afternoon while waiting for the party to start."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,I read online reviews before watching this movie and had expectations. Surprisingly this was one of the worst movies in Marvel series. Those online reviews with 8+ are obviously fake.The only guy who can act in this movie is the main character. Other film crew has horrible acting skills. So fake and so embarrassing - it is unbelievable. The plot is just idiotic. I can't even comment on that because I don't know where to start.This is so bad I gave up after 50 minutes of watching. I feel sorry for the people who watched this absurd in the cinema.They had so much potential to make a great movie.How did they end up with this junk?
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,1/10,"This movie was a scam in its entirety. Everything from the beginning of the movie until the end was just all stupid nonsense. 
For starters, it had alot of subliminal politics that didnt have any purpose to the plot itself, Just filled with unnecessary liberal propaganda badly executed. ""It says alot that i hate it, because count myself as liberal.""
None of the characters were likeable, and their development through out was even worse than their acting. The cast were Americans basically but tried to speak with african accent to create depth, but failed miserably. The CGI was even worse than then plot and acting. And Finally the soundtrack was way over the top and misplaced on so many occations. Kinda like if you took Breaking of the fellowship by Howard Shore and put it in Thor Ragnarok...Disgraceful.."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Black panther is a good blockbuster pushed to greatness by its importance as a cultural milestone. As far as the recent movies from marvel go, Black Panther is a stand out in how it goes beyond entertainment to dig deeper than most superhero blockbusters. The political statements of a film based in African culture and heritage are main themes and are addressed but manage not to be heavy handed. It can't be ignored, the cultural importance of a movie rooted so deeply in African American culture with important figures of that community coming from all different mediums to create this movie. While its easy for the film to become wrapped up in the statements that it makes within the context of our society, it also functions as one of the better products of marvels fail proof formula. As all marvel films, the characters are a strength, each is compelling and the villains are especially well done, a feat that marvel has struggled with in the past. The action sequences are creative and through all of the quips and jokes there are some genuine heartfelt moments. In the end Black Panther is an enjoyable movie elevated by what it means in a broader context."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"At best a ""red box"" movie. It was a 2 hour movie that felt like 4 hours."
BLACK PANTHER,12 January 2019,2/10,"I was pumped up for this movie.But the plot was cheesy and weak. Characters shallow, fight scenes senseless.There is NO way that this movie deserves 7.4 score. In my opinion it is around 5.9/10 unless they paid a large number of people to score it 10/10."
BLACK PANTHER,11 July 2018,1/10,"This movie was an absolute shambles, the direction was all wrong, the CGI was weak and overused, the forced humour intolerable and the heavy emphasis on politics which was unconvincing and tired took away from the story which was also weak and poorly planned out. Acting was terrible and the only saving grace perhaps was Andy Serkis' performance firstly because he was the only actor with a convincing accent but he also captured the craziness of his character well enough to warrant some sort of believability. The rest of the cast were bland and uninteresting, their story arcs were unnatural and there were many plot holes throughout the whole film. The ending of the film has to go down as one of the worst movie endings I have ever seen, heavily politicised dialogue which was out of place within the context of the scene. To summarise, poorly acted, poorly directed, poor CGI, forced humour, force-fed politics, weak and arbitrary character motives. Although entitled to their opinions anyone who gives this film anything higher than a 3 is not really seeing the film for what it is but for the fear of the social implications of not liking it."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,"I've just been to you see this film and wanted to walk out half way through it really started to get annoying the script is terrible the affects are sub par and except for Michael B Jordan, Andy Sirkis and Michonne from the walking dead the acting is pretty terrible the only reason I gave it 5 stars was that the kids really enjoyed it."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,7/10,"The first time I saw this was in a Cinebarre theater, the sound was terrible. The movie in the next theater was louder, we could actually hear it better, so I was disappointed. Just watched it again at home with much better sound (4kUHD). I don't really understand all the negative reviews on here. Is it the greatest Marvel movie ""no"", but it's far from the worse. It's a shame where we are as a society today, when a movie is judged on race instead of the integrity of the film."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"Is the super hero movie genre running out of steam and making people feel fatigued? Probably yes, but what makes Black Panther stand out is that the audience is transported to a new land of Wakanda. Where we see diversity and culture. Where the message at the end is we don't just stand for ourselves anymore, but the world. We aren't seeing a superhero who is just discovering their powers in a neighborhood or city but instead a man who is to become king and making more of a bigger decision to not just helping his own people. This movie has fun action and great music that is influenced by this fictional country based in Africa. People have high expectactions for a formula that Marvel has been using for years now and that is why they come out disspaointed. Expect a fun movie with action and comedy elements with a few cameos or easter eggs, that is the way of Marvel. Black Panther stands on its own and is diversive enough as a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy to keep the Marvel momentum going."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I'm gonna have to go with the critics on this on this one, Black Panther was amazing! It wasn't completely flawless, but I will still give it a 10 star rating to balance the ratings a bit more. Honestly, I feel like the 1 star ratings are from people that didn't want to like the film from the start. There are barely any comedic jokes, the CGI was good (no CGI is absolutely perfect), the storyline was fantastic and the scenery was majestic. For those who were disappointed about the movie being boring, you shouldn't have expected a ton of action. Black Panther ORIGIN story is about his new responsibility, his ideals and Wakanda. He can go kick butt in the next Avengers film. Thoroughly enjoyed it and don't understand some hate."
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2018,6/10,"I enjoyed Black Panther. It was a boilerplate Marvel movie that did not disappoint. The story was exciting, albeit predictable, and the visual experience cannot help but to give one pleasure. The artistic value of the film fell flat, and I was left wanting for any profound depth, but during an adrenaline filled journey to distant lands I didn't miss it. The theme had some modern relevance, though I will have to admit it was difficult not to recognize the homage to the black equivalent of the KKK in both the movie name and the hero's identity. Once you establish that to an audience prior to entering the theater, I think you are allowed some unchallenged aggressions that could have been written by Colin Kaepernick (calling the only white guy in the movie ""colonizer"" was ridiculous).Another thing this did was to create a certain fear on the part of movie critics in bringing all of their intellectual clarity to bear. I noticed some movie services have this movie ranked higher than ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Amadeus"" or ""American Beauty"". That rating is absolutely delusional. I give IMDb a lot of credit for keeping things in perspective. This movie, while quite entertaining, will be long forgotten while those true pieces of artistry are still being enjoyed.All in all, if you like Marvel movies, you are going to like this one as I did. If super hero movies are not your thing, then this movie is too blunt an instrument (mind wandering to Amadeus) to change your mind."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,I'm surprised that this film has a such a high rating on here. In my opinion this film is bad start to finish.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,2/10,"After the excellent.....and hilarious.....Thor 3, I was rather looking forward to this. Positive reviews had also whetted the appetite. Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a ""Black Panther tale"" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,2/10,Over hyped and over rated. I have no idea why so many people seem to love this movie. Acting is ok at best. Story is boring and the special effects stunk.
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,8/10,"For those who haven't seen the movie yet, I will shove all the spoilers toward the end of this review so that you can harmlessly read the first part of this review.One reason why I am writing this review is because I am shocked about how much hate this movie is receiving - and it's a good movie too! I can understand everyone's hate against Star Wars: The Last Jedi (which was also critically acclaimed, but even I wasn't too impressed with that movie), but I'm less sure why so many people are ranting on this movie as well.Here are some reasons why it's a good movie.I'll start off with the plot. The plot was pretty straightforward and intact, and very captivating. True, there may be one or two minor plot holes, but the majority of it is still pretty connected and exciting. I will say though that some of the plot was predictable, however there were a couple parts that I found surprising (see spoiler section for more info).Now I'll talk about the characters. The acting was decent, but not spectacular (except for Andy Serkis - I wouldn't be too surprised if he was Oscar nominated). The character development was great, however I felt like they could have had more development with the lead - I would occasionally feel more connection to the side characters than I would with T'Challa. But back to the positive side, I don't think I've ever seen greater chemistry among the characters than in any other movie I've ever seen; their relationships with one another was completely believable, for I love how they're always saluting and joking with each other. I personally consider Shuri to be my favorite side character.
Killmonger did make a better villain than other villains featured in the franchise. However, I won't consider him to be one of the greats (Red Skull, Loki, Ultron, Hela(?), Thanos), since he has less potential to be remembered in the long run. But I will say that he is properly developed, and his evil motivations are actually relatable. But I still think Klaue made the better villain, though (see spoiler section for more info).The overall theme of the movie seems pretty distinct from other movies in the franchise. I will admit, though, that I was a little weirded out at first because of some of the tribal rituals, but over time I found myself enjoying the movie more and more as I went along. The cinematography was spot-on, the directing and screenwriting were also great, and the movie overall was action-packed and enjoyable.SPOILERS EVERYONE!!! ONLY READ FURTHER IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE OR YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT BEFOREHAND.
Going back to the plot, I mentioned before how it was partly predictable. Sure, it was totally predictable that Klaue would escape from custody (since the trailer itself spoiled that) and it was just as predictable to see that T'Challa had survived falling off the cliff. In addition, it was also very predictable that M'Baku and his tribe would join the fight at the end despite M'Baku declining T'Challa's plea for help (that was also spoiled by the trailer).
However, there were other parts of the plot that I found surprising. I was not expecting Killmonger to kill Klaue halfway through the movie (which I actually found disappointing, since I personally think that Klaue made the better villain). And though it was predictable that T'Challa would survive falling off the cliff, I found it surprising that M'Baku said that he already found and recovered him (I was expecting T'Challa to recover on his own and then he and his family would find each other). Also, I was half-expecting Agent Ross to die during the scene where he remotely pilots the plane to take out those other aircraft that were delivering vibranium (since he was under fire from his remote control spot), so I was somewhat surprised that he had enough time to take out all the aircraft AND escape before the lab was broken into.There also was somewhat of a political message to it. For a long time, the Wakandans were very secretive and exclusive of their vibranium supply (and mostly about Wakanda itself), but when future controversies arose regarding it, T'Challa made the choice to defy his fathers' traditions and begin reaching out to the public. Killmonger had similar intentions, but he sought to do so in a tyrannical manner - by declaring war against the more powerful nations so that the smaller nations could prosper. T'Challa, on the other hand, chose to make a more peaceable approach to assisting other countries. I'm personally in full favor of this decision - we should all do our part to share our benefits with others, not in a socialist way, but in a way that shows that we want people to benefit the same way we're benefiting (however I trust that Wakanda will still be careful about their outreach, considering how their assets should not and cannot be trusted in the wrong hands)."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,9/10,"The Marvel Studios superhero movie, Black Panther, has gleaned a lot of hype and praise as being not just good, but something really different. I think the movie mostly lives up to that praise, but I view its specialness as being not so much in being ""different,"" as in ""finally getting it right.""The movie works on two levels. The first is as a dramatic piece in the thriller genre. Secondly, and more important, it works as an artistic and social watershed. It is a ""black movie"" in the way that movies should have long since portrayed black people and their experience in western civilization. It seems that the best rebuke to the ""white man's burden"" concept comes from a superhero movie.First, this is a good, action-packed, thriller movie. It has all the requirements of the thriller genre-a strong protagonist fighting long odds and supported by heroic friends against an equally strong antagonist. The dramatic tension is primarily from the contest between protag and antag, with large doses of physical battles in carrying out the plot. It even has a bit of a ""macguffin"" thrown in (the vibranium). There's all the spills and chills with fast-paced action of a Marvel superhero movie, but it's done well in that the action is not ""over the top"" (e.g., Thor Ragnarok). Also, the script doesn't indulge in the irritating fad of tongue-in-cheek ""humor"" (also e.g., Thor Ragnarok). I mean the characters operate within the constraints of the fiction's universe and they take it seriously. There is humor, but it doesn't pull the viewer out of the dramatic experience.The characters and situations are taken from the Marvel comics, but the storyline is pretty much basic thriller. I'm OK with such genre fiction when it's done well, and it is with this movie. The action is thrilling with very good SFX and CGI. The plotline keeps the tension up with enough complications to keep it from being predictable (up to a point). I liked that the Black Panther costume wasn't so ""mechanized"" as many of the superhero costumes are. It is closer to the ""non-tech"" costuming of the comics rather than the militaristic ""armor"" so many of the superhero costumes have become in their movie representations. That aspect emphasizes the hero's superness rather than the costume.Now, I think that good characterizations take a thriller story to a higher level. That's especially true in a superhero movie, where you run the risk of making a kid's movie and putting off the adults. Ryan Coogler (writer and director) is successful in that regard, and more. T'Challa is sufficiently strong, though with weaknesses, and moral enough to fight for justice against villains who are either morally depraved (Klaue) or misguided-dysfunctional (Killmonger). So its easy to pull for T'Challa. Casting was well done. Chadwick Boseman brings out the right blend of strength, intelligence, and moral fiber in T'Challa/Black Panther. Michael B. Jordan plays, Killmonger, T'Challa's chief rival with a range from street punk to bad a-s , to tragic figure. He seems to be a capable actor so I expect we'll see more of him. A couple of venerable actors lent some class and gravitas to the story. One is Forest Whitaker as Zuri, and the other is Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. Martin Freeman is CIA agent, Everett Ross, who is a sympathetic helper character. Freeman is a Brit playing his character with an American accent. He does it well and that seems to be the current fad. I had my biggest problem with Freeman's character. For having such an anti-colonial theme, here is a CIA agent as the protagonist's friend and significant helper. Well, I guess this is based on a comic book.While on the subject of the cast, I have to mention Andy Serkis, who has finally played a role that is not CGI or in heavy makeup. He plays the baddie, Klaue, and apparently bulked up for the part. Bless his heart. He'll always be Gollum to me.On the higher level, this movie breaks significant ground for African-Americans. The characters are mostly African-American and the story is told from the ""black African"" viewpoint. Without condescension or insulting stereotyping, the movie presents a story of black people as people-real people, as good and bad and nuanced as all human beings are. This has not really been done well before. Not even in such classics as the 1970s' Roots series. It is in keeping with Stan Lee's vision and it just excels over the what Hollywood has done in the past. Even so, it breaks that barrier, though just barely.For example, there is a strong anti-colonial theme in the movie. To protect itself and the vibranium element that empowers it, the nation of Wakanda hides itself behind a cloak of ""normal"" third world poverty. When we see the real Wakanda, we see the level of development that African nations should have attained, if not for the imperialism of the west (ongoing today). This seen in the white characters expressing disdain for African ""savages,"" and in the deriding term of ""colonist"" being applied to the white CIA agent (appropriately!). This theme is subtle, however, and I don't know how many younger viewers will catch it. Not many, I suspect.This movie is Heart of Darkness turned around. Probably, kudos for that should go to both Stan Lee and Ryan Coogler. They've made, not just a superhero story with an African protagonist, but something important in the history of socially-charged drama."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,3/10,"I apologize that this review might seem like a bit of a rant, but I haven't seen such an interesting idea get wasted like this since Avengers 2. Plot:
This can easily be broken into two parts. The first half, which went way too slowly and was kind of useless, and the second half which seemed like a useless squabble. Everything before killmonger actually showed up in Wakanda seemed like a bunch of exposition to explain the events of the second half. Wakanda and its traditions, while cool, had way too many deus ex technologies that seemed to just support the events in the story rather than introducing the country's technological advancement or advancing its mythos. Mega healing medicine, need that to save freeman and T'chala. Monorail that absorbs the power of vibranium, yup that's how they'll defeat Killmonger. Challenging the King, used twice when T'Challa allows M'kabi to go free so he can magically save him later on, and to allow Killmonger to take over...and this continues to happen outside of Wakanda too... Claw gets caught... oh that's to show T'Chala that Killmonger works with him and push him to ask about the ring... It seemed like they had a plan for him to get caught only to get busted out... FOR NO REASON!!!Immediately after showing up, Killmonger challenges the king and he accepts. No one has any questions, concerns, or anything? Yes, let's let this random guy who shows up claiming to be the son of the King's brother, whom has never even been to Wakanda, take over the most advanced civilization in the without fully understanding their culture technology etc. Not to mention, the traditionalists side with him due to tradition and those looking for change are just like, yup, this will bring us into the new world. Let's just hand everything over to him...Character motivations and ideologies also seemed all over the place. W'Kabi who at first looks to support T'Chala immediately defects because he wasn't able to capture claw? Considering T'Chaka attempted to do the same, and failed for 30 years prior, you'd think he'd be supportive and offer advice. Then once Killmonger shows up is like, yeah, he killed claw so I offer my undying allegiance to you, even over the one I call my love...T'Chala, before opening up to the UN, just drops one of his ships into the middle of the ghetto just to show off to some kids...Also, why are people so shocked by his ship? They've seen things like ironman, the invasion from aliens in Avengers 1, the robots in Part 2, villians like the vulture in Spiderman. Wouldn't they be more scared than anything considering most who have this kind of technology are villians? Wouldn't that make them spread the news instantly rather than possibly being an accessory to a villian. But he was nice, so we'll keep his secret. I can go on and on... Here's some things I would have liked to of seen.
Instead of just introducing Wakanda and Killmonger to us at the beginning, a better first half could have been spent following Killmonger and how he learns of Wakanda and its technology etc. That way when viewers finally get to see Wakanda, it really makes it seem like the mythological place it's talked about as and how he knows so much and more understandable as to why he wants to support others.Instead of Having Killmonger work with claw to kill him, have him build trust within Wakanda, then kill Claw to prove how much of better leader he is. This would make him taking over much more understandable and show us that the revolutionists believe in his ability to lead, rather than the blind following they go with. Have T'Chala offer Killmonger a place in Wakanda before dying. He's clearly open to change by this point and will need guidance. Why not take an adviser that sees all the problems from an outside perspective. Not only this, but wouldn't it make sense to rectify their fathers' mistakes and put the past behind?GET RID OF MIRACLE MEDICINE. I'm not sure if this is part of the comics, but this should not exist at all. You have millions of people dying in places all around your country and your only answer is we need to keep it a secret. Yeah... better to keep that secret rather than help cure those aids epidemics happening all around you. Not only that, but clearly they don't offer aid to their people living outside of the border walls as shown at the beginning of the movie when he tells the captives to remain quiet about their rescue...I'll end on this. I didn't absolutely hate the movie as there are some things to like. The country and tech is kinda cool, SOME characters really are interesting (i.e. Killmonger) but the decisions made in this film were just infuriating. I really hope they find a better writer for the sequels cause there is good opportunities for stories to be told here..."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,3/10,I am a huge fan of marvel movies and yet for some reason this movie left me with an empty feeling when i walk out of the movie because honestly this movie probably has the worst action scenes out of all the marvel movies not only can you hardly tell whats happening but black panther is invaluable so there is zero tension i was also wanting to see Michael b Jordan's villain character perhaps bring something new to the table and brake the trend of forgettable marvel villains but unfortunately he is just another disposable bad guy whose master plan is you guessed it take over the world i cant even remember any of the other characters names because there are all basically the same just warrior woman or warrior man i suppose the one thing keeping this movie from being bad is the world that they establish is kind of interesting and black panther himself is still a cool character but if i hadn't already seen civil war i have no idea if i would still have that opinion also the what are those meme makes it into this movie for some reason and i almost walked out of the movie right there if you do not already like black panther this movie wont change your mind
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"This movie didn't do justice for Black Panther while it was an ok movie it was boring at best and predictable, but I didn't expect much from Marvel on this one they seam to have trouble on origin movies (Cap America the first Avenger and Thor 1 and some what Thor 2 as well they were boring also). Well I hope we get a Black Panther 2 with a better villain and no family drama."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"A film full of culture, own style. A solid story; of political and racial conflicts. Visually beautiful, excellent costumes, Wakanda feels totally real and beautiful, the CGI of the film is excellent except in some places. 
Our characters are incredible: Lettita Wright as Shuri gives us that comic-sarcastic touch totally of the MCU, Lupita Nyong'o gives us a warrior totally loyal to her nation, Michel B. Jordan as Killmonger us one of the best villains of the MCU, with good motivations, which make the viewer doubt if in reality he is on a good path. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther to whom we see him defending his nation, and upholding his beliefs and decisions.
In particular, the film is excellent breaking the mold of the latest films of the MCU, has a serious tone, action at the most, and a good subject to reflect.
The only bad thing about the movie is that at the beginning it feels a bit slow, but when it is introduced, the story catches you and has a good development."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"WOW! I cannot put into words how amazing, powerful, beautiful, and well done this movie was. All I can say is please go see for yourself! You've outdone yourself Marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,10/10,"I loved watching this. The cast and the plotline all of that was beautiful. The one problem I did have with this film is ""it glorified destructive and misleading stereotypes that are actually injurious to the African diaspora today."" The black girl nutures the safe Caucasian - typical. The black woman is fierce and combative to the man she loves - typical. African vs African American - ""Not Cool."" This film recieved so much praise for being a 'breakthrough' film for Africans and I would have been able to appreciate completely if it did glorify injurious realities that have disadvantaged and even mentally enslave african people to inferior freedom as a people globally and carry forward the status quo just with a most black cast this time. So for me it was ""a good effort"" and gets a 10 for progress and quality. However, it was a miss on the message and left something for future projects to aspire to correct. I can't board 'The social media bandwagon' on this one but I see you Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Black Panther starts out promising with acting by Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and many more but unfortunately starts to fall flat like most film within the MCU. The problems with this film are the same with many others in the MCU, They go on for longer than they have any right to do. Very weird editing, cinematography and really bad CGI that we will all probably laugh at in 5 years time.The biggest problem with this film come when just over half way through ( I think, It feels like 2 hours in) they change the main bad guy to Jordan's character but it should have been him from the start and really didn't come as a shock when it happened because Serkis's character just feels weird in this film. Overall, all the actors do great with a very standard Marvel Film."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"I was disappointed especially after all the positive reviews. What is with critics?? I am noticing that they give all blockbusters 10/10s and the like!!Next to the very stupid and boring new 'Star Wars' this is the worst though. The film is quite boring to start and wastes the potential to educate or entertain. Especially with its African setting it could have taught the audience a thing or two. Instead, we learn nothing, the fights are stupid and weak, there s little action overall and only the last 15 minutes are watchable. It is not worth $15 for the last 15 minutes in my opinion however. I did like the music however. So 4/10.I am still scratching my head at all the awful films the critics keep giving thumbs up to. Think this boring and underdeveloped film, think the last two so-called Star Wars, think Blade Runner 2049. There are still good films out there (The Gifted, Get Out, Captain Fantastic), but the hype goes to the wrong movies.
Perhaps it is time for Marvel and Disney to retire. Who knows?"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"I had high expectations for this film after I saw Black Panther appear in Civil War. Unfortunately this movie fell way short of being a good Marvel movie. I'm not sure what the critics watched, but this movie does not deserve a near perfect score. I usually don't review movies but I saw on rotten tomatoes that the majority of reviews were 5 stars from people who hadn't seen the movie yet.Story: I was happy to see the setting of Africa and the city of Wakanda. It was fresh and had the potential to be anything it wanted to be. However the pace of the movie and the character arks and motivations didn't sit well with me throughout the movie.CGI got spotty really quick, especially during the last fight scene which was disappointing because at the very least the movie lead to the one climatic fight.The woman general that is always besides black panther was my favorite character by far. It seemed like she is the only character that got any sort of development.Music really broke immersion for me. the transitions from a beat oriented or suspenseful sound to African calls and more tribal music was such a stark difference you almost want to cringe. It seems they only played that music when showing the viewer that the setting had returned to Africa."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"Don't let all the recent negative reviews fool you. This movie was a marvel from beginning to end...pun intended! Not sure why the keyboard warriors, who all strangely have deemed this movie over-hyped, have decided on mass to say the same thing over and over and over again, resulting in their utter disappointment in Black Panther, have decided to all take the time to do everything in their power to bring down the stellar ratings for the film, but I guess everyone needs a senseless hobby. As for hype, what superhero movie doesn't get the hype machine treatment. If you're saying people were overly eager for the movie due to the black director, 95% black cast and unpresidented theme of female empowerment, without nary a slave in the story, then hell yeah, sign me up for that hype! Those factors aren't the only reasons I loved it, but they play a big role, so sue me for being excited by and appreciative of how it all came together. I think the money it has made worldwide and repeat views speak louder than any keyboard warrior army bent on trying to curb your enthusiasm (shout out to you Larry D!). I loved this film because it made me laugh, think, marvel and feel pride. I don't expect more than that in a movie and ever time I get it, its money well spent. I've spent a heck of a lot more for a heck of a lot less!"
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,5/10,"After the very decent 3rd Thor movie I expected a lot more. I took a friend of mine with me that doesn't have a clue about anything MCU related and he was bored. A lot. Very predictable plot, the worst CGI since The Incredible Hulk and tons of tons of plot holes.
Black Panter feels like a recycled Thor: Ragnarok; The legacy of a father that has made mistakes, an evil relative and a fight to win back what was lost. There are no stakes in this movie, you know how it will turn out the second something is happening, killing any suspense. The movie is full of interesting concepts, but they just get left behind. At least the set design is really nice, you want to see more of it.This is by far the most overrated movie in the MCU. But most User Reviews reflect this already so I won't go into detail. The culture, the characters and Wakanda itself are so extremely interesting and you want to create a connection to them, but the weak plot and the lack of stakes just stop you from feeling anything toward this film, other than maybe the feeling of a wasted opportunity."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,4/10,"How this crap movie got 7.8, I really don't know. I am utterly baffled.
This movie has 7.8 and The Godfather has 9.4. ??????????
No African country ever had or ever will have the technology they showed in the movie. If America could have all we've seen in the movies generally speaking, Africa will not !
CGI and FX galore, pretty good acting, but crap movie over all. Bad story, no integration in the Marvel Universe."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,10/10,"Being a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe I personally felt that the franchise needed a film like this away from shrinking heroes, wealthy big name billionaires, and also Norse-Gods from other worlds, bringing another continent/civilisation stops us from wondering what the rest of the world is actually doing during these attacks/ attempted takeovers over Earth, I can not wait until Infinity war is released."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,3/10,"The film's is fine, it's nothing special, all this race hype is overblown. Why this film that is marketed to and dumbed down for kids. Yeah, very important!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,8/10,I seen the movie today and I thought that the storyline and the visuals were pretty amazing. I have a feeling I put pretty high expectations on it though because I thought that the storyline could have a little bit more feeling into it as for I am one that has never read the comics so I can only refer my knowledge to the movie. The technology they have in the movie was also pretty amazing things because it seems all out of this world. In general I thought this movie was pretty well made.
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,5/10,"Not sure why such success. I thought the movie was just average. Some of it was pretty nonsensical. Story was a bit weak. Klue has a 30 year run of success against Wokonda??? How?? For one, he looks no older than 40. Another: the kingdom is so far advanced than anywhere on Earth but yet they still all bow down to an unelected King?"
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,5/10,"Pretty average movie. Marvel is still struggling with action that feels cool and doesn't make me throw up. Story was pretty cliche but I do think Michael B. Jordan gave an awesome performance. Otherwise the characters were fairly bland and uninteresting. Definetly overhyped by critics, which in turn caused a lot of low user reviews. If you just wanna watch an action movie, you can do a lot worse."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,9/10,"It was a solid Marvel Movie. I saw it a few times, but I usually do with most Marvel films. I think a lot of the bad reviews are coming from the over hype of the movie, but what do I know? It was a good movie. Standard for it's genre, but if you're expecting the best thing you've ever seen in your life, that's where you might be disappointed. I say still go see it and have a nice night out. That's what you'll get with it."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,9/10,"Black Power is how I describe this movie. And it's powerful. It brought what was missing in the MCU which was more representation. The universe still lacks of it but this movie brought a good deal of it.
King T'Challa isn't even the best character in the movie, even the villain is better; Killmonger is one of the best, if not the best, villain of all the MCU.
My personal favorite is Shuri, T'Challa's little sister. She represents so much: intellect, cunning, humor and woman power. She is a young lady who commands all the technological side of Wakanda, she brings innovation and modernism into all she does. She is fearless and doesn't mind standing up for her opinions. Her style and personality is fun and young, she is all a young girl should aspire to be. She's a model.
Aside from her, all the others female and male characters bring their own thing to make this movie a masterpiece.
The artistic side of the movie deserves an applause, the costumes, the dances, the architecture of Wakanda, all was so beautiful and reminding of African style with just a touch of futurism. All pure Wakanda style. I wouldn't mind having a dressing like T'Challa's. Especially those old school sandals (WHAT ARE THOSE???).
The soundtrack of this movie is also one of wonder, the beats were just so enjoyable.
I loved this movie, I can't find it a flaw or something I didn't like. I have seen it twice and both were just as fun."
BLACK PANTHER,7 August 2018,1/10,"So overrated and so bad! 
This thing (because i don't know if i should call it a movie) was so cliche so overrated and it only had that ratings because all of the cast where black!"
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,8/10,"I'm going to start this review off by saying this is one of the best superhero films I have seen in my life. The themes and characters are beyond what we have seen in a recent superhero film. One of the films strongest points is its visuals which are more creative and unique than any Marvel film to date. The clear ingenuity of the crew working on this movie is present in every visually stunning scene, which is practically every scene. This is by far the most beautifully shot Marvel movie to date. Wakanda itself is a visual masterpiece and it only gets better from there. If had to complain about one thing, it would have to be the action scenes, which are good, just a bit average, which makes it seem a lot worse, when everything in this movie is incredible otherwise. Perhaps the best part of Black Panther: the characters. The best part about the characters is their diversity dn excellent representation of a black cast and female leads. T'Challa himself is a sort of bland character. He more or less feels like the typical kind of average lead in a superhero movie, despite excellent acting from Boseman. Similar to T'Challa, Everett Ross is one of the few things keeping this movie from a 10 star rating. He is just a typical white guy stuck in a foreign nation with no clue what to do. Once again, martin Freeman has a great performance, but the problem lies in the character and the fact he really doesn't improve the movie at all. It ends up being Killmonger who steals the show the most, presenting an excellent villain, with a great backstory and very strong acting. He is everything you need in a villain. He is badass, as the scene after the museum heist proves. He is an excellent foe to challenge the protagonist and his goals are understandable. That may not sound like a necessity for a good villain, but trust me, it is. The fact that you are able to see where the villain is coming from helps you understand his character and the fact that he is doing this for the mistake of a previous Black Panther. Klawe is also a great villain, mostly because of Andy Serkis' stellar performance. He doesn't really do much, but he has some great humor and that acting is so perfect. Also, I have never seen a movie handle its female characters as well as this film. Gone are damsels in distress or females who are there to be love interests and nothing else. All of the females in this movie are badass, unique characters. I would especially like to highlight Shuri, who is a character that proves a very young, black, female can be incredibly smart and still be amazing at combat. Shuri is an excellent character, a character most films in general have failed to create as compelling a character. Okoye proves hardass bodyguards don't have to be buff men in tuxes, and Nakia proves that females can actually be the ones to save the day and be the one who has the correct plan for the nation, rather than a simple love interest. In conclusion, this film has some of most well-characterized, original, likable and compelling characters in a movie ever. Another excellent character, this one something of a surprise is M'Baku. M'Baku ends up being a fun, badass, excellent character who doesn't have a huge role but Winston Duke uses his screen time to create an extremely compelling character. Something to go with that same concept is the story of family. T'CHalla might be boring character but he is part of a brilliant family blood relatives or not, that will stop at nothing to save him. It is possibly the best part of the film, when the story focuses on that group of people who has not yet given up on T'Challa. Yet another amazing thing about this film is the politics involved with it. The theme, message, and resolution of the story of Wakanda, and yes the nation does have a story, is a very good, wonderfully thought story. This film captures racial politics unlike any film I have recently seen. In an industry that finally supports fins revolving around a mainly black cast and the story of how black people fit into the world around them, I am glad to see this film made. The themes of Wakanda standing alone and the themes involving the other countries of the world are all amazing themes that will leave you thinking about this film's real-life significance even after it is over. Not since Get Out has a movie done that to me. Lastly, the story in this film is incredibly compelling. All the scenes will have the audience drawn in. You will be at the edge of your seat, caring for all the main characters, hoping that Killmonger is defeated. This is one of the few recent movies that captured my interest all the way through, and not only did it do that, it also used an excellent diverse cast to play amazing character, wonderfully shot scenes and amazing themes."
BLACK PANTHER,15 April 2018,2/10,One of the worst of the super hero movies. I would put it one notch above the Green Lantern. Slow and boring. Sad that the critics feel like they have to rate it high for fear of being considered racist.
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,10/10,Best ever. I loved the soundtrack. Videography was amazing. Costumes and styling out of this world. Overall wonderful movie.
BLACK PANTHER,5 June 2018,7/10,"It's a quiet copy of ""throne of atlantis""..Not much extra ordinary representation. Killmonger is a good villain and the potrayal of it is very much impressive. Claw may can get more screenspace. And it carries a good shadow of the lion king. It's just a Disney thing."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,2/10,"Reminds me of ""blacksploitation"" movies of the 70s. Characters are mostly stereotypes weather Africans or African American. Even the token white guys are the evil South African or CIA hero. Could not wait for this film to end."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,8/10,"Probably one of the most ""out of the buble"" MCU movies to date, touch in subjects that other movies just forget the existence, and bring an amazing beautiful look into african culture, Black Panther it's defintelly the super hero that black community needs, and the hate that the movie recieves with the ""1/10"" scores shows it, it's definitelly not a perfect movie but is far far way from bad enought to receive ""1/10"", it's just plain and simple hate."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,1/10,"Listen, just as so many of you guys i'm a huge fan of the MCU. I've seen them all multiple times. This is why i don't get why this movie gets so many good reviews. 
It lacks of story, the acting in some parts of the movie is terrible, the cgi is one of the worst of all the Marvel movies, and there are so many unnecessary scenes and dialogues that i wish i never saw this movie. 
Im really really disappointed of this movie. And more and more i really doubt that IMDB voting/rating... somethings just wrong."
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,1/10,This movie is overrated. Its very boring. I fell asleep because of how boring it was. Dont waste your time on this trash movie
BLACK PANTHER,5 October 2018,2/10,"As the title says, this is nothing more than a PC piece of SJW libtard crap. It DOES have a few instances of humor, but they are few and far between. Not worth anyone's time, and the only reason I bothered to finish the entire movie was because I was watching all Marvel movies in chronological order, if that is not your goal, don't bother."
BLACK PANTHER,27 June 2018,3/10,"What a disappointment this was. The story was bizarre and the acting terrible to begin with. The attempt to mix a disney like lion king story with aliens was a bit odd but it's part of the marvel universe so I guess it's not a big surprise. But trying to also include some sort of more serious racial inequality message in the same movie was out of place and more than a bit hypocritical - it seemed like all of the main characters were American or British so it didn't exactly promote Africans, even though the story was about an African people. Just a weird movie all around."
BLACK PANTHER,6 September 2018,8/10,"There are a bunch of haters out here in the world. Really, this movie ia different. It has a whole different feel than any other comic book movie. The colors, the outfits, the diversity, the whole conceptualization os different. I think this is a fabulous movie. Writing could have been a little better amd could have been shortened down but other than that, great movie."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2020,,A monocultural utopia ! Two thumbs up! - Dave Duke.
BLACK PANTHER,29 October 2018,1/10,I can't even write a review for this movie the writing is horrible clechay action scenes and a horrible political message what else can I say the writing is beyond horrible
BLACK PANTHER,17 August 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is one of my favorite Marvel movies and I consider it one of the best. With a vast collection of superheroes in the growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was only a matter of time before this movie was made and it was done in the best possible way.I'm a big fan of African culture and loved the attention to detail Ryan Coogler and the creative team put into the movie. They researched clothing, art, architecture, and customs of different African communities and combined them to create one seamless city.I'm a big fan of Captain America, Spiderman, and other of the bigger names, but feel that superheroes of different races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations have been underrepresented. Black Panther is a step in the right direction. I love this movie because I like to absorb different cultures that I'm unfamiliar with because they're exciting. As a white person, I don't get a lot of that from movies because different cultures are underrepresented. Overrall, this movie was great and I would like to see more like it."
BLACK PANTHER,14 October 2018,1/10,I knew the hype would have been hard to live up to but it's obvious the good reviews are politically motivated which is a pity because it lots of potential. The movie is just plain terrible. Bad plot bad acting and very little action for a superhero movie.
BLACK PANTHER,2 November 2018,6/10,"At the time, the hype about this boring movie was absolutely everywhere, you'd hear about it in every corner of the street, surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the most terrible action movies, cheap effects, amateur acting coupled with horrible storyline and ending, yet a massive marketing compaign was made to make it profitable and it's a shame they succeeded at that."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2019,9/10,"Black Panther not only works as a superhero movie, but also as a commentary on the current state of the world. Black Panther is able to do almost everything right, with only some of the CGI being not on par with the rest of the film, but other than that the movie is near flawless. Chadwick Boseman returns to the character of T'challa for the first time since Civil War and he builds upon his great performance there to put in another one here. But for me, as great as Chadwick Boseman is, Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger is the best character in a movie filled with great characters. Jordan is able to play Killmonger with ease, and in my opioion is tied with Thanos for the best villian in the MCU to date, and is able to turn in a performance that is on par with the likes of Heath Ledgar as Joker in The Dark Knight. All of the side characters are able to add onto the already amazing quality of this movie, with Ulysses Klaw being particularly great. Andy Serkis plays the character for the second time after first playing him in Age of Ultron, and is able to add a sense of humor and grittiness to the character which makes him one of the most enjoyable to watch, even if his tenure is short lived. Another great part of this movie is the score, with each piece being able to convey the desired emotion of the scene, with the Killmonger theme in particular being outstanding, the tune really being to show how intimidating Killmonger really is. Wakanda is one of the most beautiful locations ever seen on screen, and the movie is able to really sell you on the hidden country. Another great thing about this movie is the astral plane sequence, which is drawing obvious inspiration from gen Lion King, which is actually drawn on a lot in this movie, which is not at all a bad thing. In conclusion, Black Panther is an amazing movie with great characters, setting, score, and story, which allow it to become one of my favorite films of all time, and the best the MCU has to offer."
BLACK PANTHER,18 November 2018,7/10,"I am not a fan of Marvel production and find superhero movies infantile, so it amazes me to see so many comments pointing out how stupid and illogical the premises are in a superhero movie :)I was therefore surprised that I actually enjoyed the film and the entertainment it provided. I thought acting was good for the genre it was in (again, what kind of Shakespearean depth can you expect in an action movie? What are you comparing it with, Iron Man? Please.). I absolutely loved the visuals, the costumes were great. The idea of having a magical yet also cultural narrative to a superhero film makes it that much more like an actual movie. The female warriors and the general male-female dynamic is quite a statement in itself for a movie in this genre as well. I guess those who hate on the film are not able to appreciate these aspects. It's sad to see so many people calling this (and those who reviewed it positively) political. But we live in a post-factual hyper-reality so I guess it's the new norm, unfortunately."
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2019,6/10,I found the film to be a little disappointing but it did have its moments
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,4/10,"Visually it's great, but storyline and characters is really bad."
BLACK PANTHER,19 June 2021,7/10,"So great to watch, but poisened by political propaganda."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2019,10/10,"Now, before I start this review, the one person writing all these 1 star reviews on different accounts need to stop.
Let me just start by saying that this movie is everything you would want from a Marvel Movie. From the plot to the characters and their stories, this is the perfect Marvel movie. Sue me. I don't care. It's amazing.The start of the movie is a flashback to when N'Jobu was alive and planning a heist os some sorts, until he feels the need to hide the guns. Then, members of the Dora Milan's, a army of women from Wakanda knock at his door, while his friend, who is actually Zuri. They open the door, and the lights turn on and off, and then, king T'Chaka is there. Him and N'Jobu, his actual name, are brothers. N'Jobu figures out that Zuri, who N'Jobu doesn't know is also a spy, is from Wakanda. Let me flash forward cuz your probably getting bored.There are a few lines from Erik Killmonger, or N'Jadaka that makes me think about my ancestors, who are black. Near the end, Killmonger says this: ""Bury me in the oceans, like my ancestors who jumped from the ships, cause' they knew, that death... was better than bondage."" That got me thinking that one of my ancestors managed to survive slavery and NOT jump from the ships that is just amazing to me. Another line that still is important to me at least is when Killmonger said this: ""Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country don't gotta be there, I just need him, and someone to get me out I these chains."" The chains part got me thinking about slavery.In conclusion, this movie is amazing because of the African cast, it's racial references, and it's amazing writing. It's not what you would expect from a Marvel movie, which is a very, very good thing to see."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,3/10,"After reading and seeing all the hype, I finally watched the movie. The plot was slow and plodding. Every action is telegraphed at least two scenes ahead. The acting was incredibly wooden, as if they were reading off cue cards. The CGI was good, but it really did not add to removing the tedium of watching this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2019,10/10,"Ok, so, I get that the professional movie review sites had very positive opinions of this movie. Honestly though, this movie deserves the praise. I believe that this is GREAT movie. It's entertaining and the acting is pretty good. You have Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Micheal B. Jordan, and even Danai Gurira for goodness sake. This movie not only has big names but it also has some cool special effects and world building. Also, it's funny and intense during some moments but I especially loved what they did with the planet of Wakanda.In my opinion, this is most interesting Marvel movie I've found myself watching. And, compared to some of the others, it's definitely not all that ""typical""."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2019,10/10,"This was the best Marvel movie ever, and I have seen them all. SO GOOD!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2019,3/10,I usually like the Marvel films but this one just didn't inspire anything in me and when it comes out to buy on digital I will pass.The acting was fine but the story line was boring a predictable.
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2019,10/10,Black Panther is fantastic ! It has everything you could want from a marvel movie and more ! From the awe inpireing visual effects to the character depth and last but least to the perfect comedic timing ! The plot is moving and yet still action packed and the characters are wonderfully portrayed especially that of T'Challa and his sister Shuri the sibling relationship is one of the best portrayals of siblings I've seen !
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2019,10/10,I loved it. It was visually stunning. Shuri is my fav.
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2021,8/10,"By far, the best movie Marvel has made in my opinion. The characters, plot and the locations made this such a good movie. I really like that this movie is all about Black people. Can't wait to see how much more diversity Marvel will bring us in the future."
BLACK PANTHER,12 April 2021,1/10,"This is without a doubt the worst Marvel movie. Between the world and me, this is total garbage and could spell the end for Marvel if they don't find better writers to keep Stan Lee's saga alive.How this won 3 awards is utterly bemusing! A dreadful disjointed plot, action scenes that make little sense even for the world of marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,9/10,"I read the amazing Black Panther comic book in 98 under the Priest run and it was the best comic run I had ever read. Such a great political study of both Wakanda and American ideals. Obviously this film borrows heavily from that run as well as Hudlin and Coates. The fascinating thing about this movie is using it as a ""what if?"" moment. Will a nation prosper if they have unique resources that was kept a secret for year? Wakanda is a nation that did not fall into the perils of colonialism and overreliance of other nations or ""aid"". The character study of TChalla and Killmonger is just as engaging. They are two sides of the same coin as their objective is to create a better world for their people. Though their methods are drastically different. Killmonger is a villain that, as an African American, you understand completely where he is coming from. He is one of Marvel's greatest villain since he provides an interesting challenge for TChalla, not just physically but morally. Coogler did a great job balancing a movie as complex as this with a great action superhero film. The action is nothing to sneeze at since it was breathtaking in most scenes. There ARE some CGI problems here or there but it was still good, especially the casino fight with a great score pacing the scene. The supporting cast is strong, especially Shuri, a different character from the comics but still fascinating. Last, it is good that a movie portrays people of color and a nation in Africa, though fictional, in a more positive light instead of pirates or war lords."
BLACK PANTHER,25 January 2020,6/10,It was pretty good but definitely not worth the hype.
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2020,1/10,Total garbage!no idea why this movie has such good reviews.If I could give it a 0 I would.
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2018,2/10,"It was very bad, yes it was ok CGI effects, but the rest was BAD, waste of time and Money, simple as that"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"Black Panther brings nothing new to the table. It's a copy/paste script, the jokes fell flat, and the ""twists"" were predictable. Michael B Jordan was the only actor who shined, everyone else was serviceable."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2020,9/10,"Finally watched this film after hearing everyone saying ""IT WAS AWESOME"" or ""WAKANDA FOREVER"". Boseman and Jordan both did awesome in their part. The fight was the best one of all! I can see why this movie had AWESOME reviews!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2020,5/10,"More uninspired nothingness from Marvel Studios. This looks like it belongs on television and not a cinema screen. My problem was, without using closed captioning I couldn't understand a single word of dialog. Including Martin Freeman who was unfortunately forced to use an American accent when his British accent would have worked just as well. Its a visually breathtaking movie, and since it does directly tie into the Infinity War saga, it needs to be seen. I just think it could have been better."
BLACK PANTHER,24 July 2020,6/10,"Genuinely a cool movie, not the best narrative, decent acting, although drastically over-hyped.The movie portrays a great message and there were some moments that I found either really funny, touching or cool in that sense of action and good CGI. It lays a solid ground-layer for a movie night with your family, although by carefully constructively criticizing it, you find very big gaps and mistakes layed out all over the movie like a minefield of unintentional demerits.The way the cultural appreciation is acclaimed in this movie is on the other hand, very good, as not just only the people involved creating the movie, but the entire black community and culture, is getting recognition in which is a very good outcome out of a decent movie in my opinion.A robust 6/10 from me."
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2021,8/10,"Look, I get that the movie is not faithful to the comics but I mean come on people. Just because it was overrated doesn't mean you need to hate. It's not exactly perfect but it's not bad. I feel like marvel has received it's own category now a days. People (not critics) almost see marvel movies as bad movies with good fighting and a few awesome fights but it's time people look past that and realize marvel or not, this was an awesome movie."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,"The message in this film is beautiful and so true. We all need to work together and be good to each other. We need to stop fighting each other, it's silly and not needed. Another reason I love this film is the fact it had rhinos in it as they are becoming extinct and are being killed for no reason. This film shows we need to respect nature too. The African vibrance in this film is unbelievable and I love it. Best marvel film ever. True to the heart and 100% real truth. Let's all love one another and lastly amazing acting! An amazing actor has passed but will always be remembered! ü§ò Chadwick your a bossman!"
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,10/10,"Movie had great plot and emotion, with charisma that can be unmatched from any other Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie. Will miss you Chadiwick!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2020,9/10,"I honestly think this is worth the hype. The plot is interesting and cool, it has a cast of loveable people, and it has awesome fighting scenes, and it has great lines like Wakanda Forever!
The only thing it is lacking is humor. I feel like this doesn't have enough humor scenes and it's just not funny.
Other then that, GREAT MOVIE"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"Seriously, I need to convince myself that I actually watched a Marvel movie, because it was so terrible. The plot was so boring,, the characters where so stupid. And the CGI was just horrible. And the times it tries to be funny.. O my. Most of the positive reviews will definitely be fake, because this is nowhere near the quality one would expect from a Marvel title."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2020,8/10,"I greatly enjoyed Black Panther and Chadwick Boseman was perfect casting, bringing strength, gravitas and a quiet dignity to the title role. This movie is fabulous entertaniment and that's what films are about. I just do not understand the negative reviews. Sure, the film wasn't perfect but it was pretty close to it.
The supporting cast was superb and convincing with T'Challa's female bodyguard genuinely looking like they could do some serious damage to an opponent. A few of the action scenes seemed a tad too long but thoroughly enjoyable all the same. A truly great film, one of the best in the genre."
BLACK PANTHER,24 October 2020,7/10,"Good Movie. I think this movie was Chadwick Boseman at his career best. Amazing Graphics.. Just like every Marvel Movie. Nevertheless, boseman was the best suited for the role of Black Panther. Storyline was similar to any Marvel movie. There was humor in between and the fight scenes without the suit looked realistic. I think Black Panther could have more powers because he is a Super Hero who has gained his strength from the past. Wakanda seems to be portrayed as a safe place for fighting Thanos in Avengers. I also believed that there exists a place called Wakanda after watching the movie. However, if there were any sequels to Black Panther, i would not be much interested. The story was predictable and i watched the movie once for the graphics and to know what superpowers Black Panther could have. This movie is a good 1 time watch."
BLACK PANTHER,25 November 2020,10/10,"This very entertaining movie. I like it very much.
I love this movie......"
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2021,4/10,"Good movie, wasn't really that great, don't believe all the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2021,5/10,"It looks good, but it have predictable plot. Even most fantastic plot have to contains logic. How has this fantastic african country achieved some high level of development? Why didn't it try to spread the positive impacts in other countryes? This fantastic country is too fantastic."
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2021,1/10,Movie sucked and I was so bored in the theater. Most overrated movie of all time hands down.
BLACK PANTHER,11 July 2021,6/10,"As a one time watch, it is surely well edited for most parts and the visuals and soundtrack make for a compelling case. But the story is very cliched, the climax extremely boring and unsatisfying.The character of T'Challa was so poorly written with almost no personality at all. He had no reasons to do any of the stuff that he did. He had no character development, and his motives for everything were fuzzy. While the Killmonger had actual reasons and motives for his deeds, an actual backstory and the well established unfaithful, non compromising personality, T'Challa lacked all of them. The only character worth watching was the likeable and relatable Shuri. They tried to sabotage Killmonger's genuine attempt at salvation of the oppressed by making him do stupid, evil things. Who will tell the writers that comically evil villains with no morals are a thing of the past, and that villains can simply think differently without being evil.Andy Serkis did an amazing job even with the limited role he had. Chadwick Boseman was left with nothing to work on by the writers. The story was predictable recycled crap. And what's up with them mentioning the refugee crisis in Wakanda? It's like they made the film and then thought how to make it politically relevant. There are numerous other writing inconsistencies and lazily written subplots.Overall nothing special, but definitely unique in terms of visuals of Wakanda. Watch and forget."
BLACK PANTHER,20 July 2021,4/10,"Watched for a long time from the plot remained in the memories, there was only a fight with aliens to which the whole film was taken painfully for a long time. The acting is normal. Although I didn't like the actor for the main role, he was too thin. The Wakandans are licked off from the usual tribe of aborigines, despite the nano technology, they still have it. I skipped scenes with them on rewind, it's not interesting. I watched the film just so that the thread of events in the Marvel films would not be lost."
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,1/10,"I may be the only person alive who will admit to watching the movie and forgetting what it was about 20 minutes later. I had trouble getting past the theoretical impossibilities abundant in the movie. Special FX for the sake of dazzling the audience? What about substance? I can say, ""I just didn't get it and since enduring a second viewing is out of the question I guess I never will."""
BLACK PANTHER,16 November 2021,8/10,Really don't understand why this movie is so controversial in BLM opinion.It doesn't matter for me if the actors are black white or a combination of them. Also I Couldn't find any hidden message so the actors were great also great technology and action movieüëå
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2021,5/10,An entertaining movie I could never deny that but it was the typical comic book movie definitely did not live up to the hype I heard about it prior.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Wow. There's just not much to criticize here. I think the people who will be most disappointed are the people going in expecting a standard action-packed superhero movie where a costumed hero battles a costumed villain for the better part of two hours with a little dialog and drama interspersed so as not to get tedious and a forced and unnecessary romance subplot no one actually cares about. This is kind of the opposite.It's an almost Shakespearean drama with fresh takes on everything that has made this genre feel tiresome. Beautiful world-building, artistic vision, mind-blowing sets, elaborate and gorgeous costuming, a dozen brilliant acting performances, a nuanced villain with a grounded real-world perspective and motivation, an extended cast that actually matters, a historical background that provides context without the endless flashbacks and hamfisted exposition, and a real sense of danger and importance surrounding the events.There are a few predictable tropes that play out exactly as expected, but it's mostly fun and highly inventive in other areas. Killmonger is one of the MCU's best villains, and the final battle was like watching a Tron remix of a Capcom fighting game."
BLACK PANTHER,17 September 2018,8/10,"Spoilers are vague.People seem to miss the point of this movie- It's a political drama mixed with an action movie. The parts in Wakanda are ""boring"" and ""don't have any action,"" because it's a peaceful country. The fact that all the action is in other countries for the first 3/4 of the film is intentional. It makes it more dramatic to see violence brought to Wakanda.I will say they could have established Wakanda's isolationist stance better by providing more arguments that the outside world is destructive. I would have also liked to see more action from Kill Monger early on to establish him as a better fighter."
BLACK PANTHER,20 October 2018,6/10,"I liked the character in Civil War and Infinity War, and I thought the cast was good as well. Decent visuals, the fight choreography left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure why Killmonger is thought of by some to be the best Marvel villain EVER, he was angry and an a##hole, big deal. It isn't terrible but the 3 Blade movies were far more entertaining. The hype and praise for this are lost on me. I went in with the same amount of enthusiasm I had for other Marvel movies, but I left feeling underwhelmed. Chadwick Bozeman is great as the titular character, but the movie just didn't scream EPIC like Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"I just can believe how in the world, a movie of this quality can make so much money. hype?? that's understatement for this garbage. it has to be conspiracy theory."
BLACK PANTHER,1 February 2021,4/10,Visually poor. Bad lighting. After 5 minutes we switched off. A movie that loses me in the first 5 minutes and cost $4! How did it ever gets such obsequious reviews. And what corny mythology of and technologically advanced central African hidden nation. Please.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"Let me start by saying I had high expectations about this film based on the trailer and all that was riding on this new addition to MCU. A fan of the Black Panther comic as a kid, I was really looking forward to this movie, and excited to see it!The graphics were incredible! The costumes and choreography during the fight scenes were great! Some of the actors were better than others, but overall, the acting was pretty good. Props and scenery were amazing!So, what's missing? Frankly, the story line, which lacks substance (except for a few socio-political lines), feels a bit rushed, repetitive, and bland. ****SPOILER WARNING****Namely, Black Panther is crowned King and goes through a spiritual ritual to take on the mantle. He then learns he has a cousin. Cousin shows up and wants the throne. They battle it out and cousin wins. Cousin goes through the same spiritual ritual to become king. Meanwhile, Black Panther, is assumed dead. His girlfriend steels a magic herb before they are all burned by King Cousin. Later, girlfriend, sister, and Panther's mother discover he is not dead but in a coma and being cared for by a rival tribe. Mother gives him herb as he goes through the spiritual ritual a second time. He comes out of the coma, takes on King Cousin, and wins back the throne.It's like take, rinse, repeat. Although the movie is over two hours long, it seems like they rushed to get it all in, yet it still lacks substance. One reviewer said the humor was ill-placed, and I would agree. In the middle of a serious moment, quick one-liners were intended to be funny, but for the most part only deserved a slight chuckle, clearly lacking Thor's most recent comic-ridden outing.Plus, the movie focuses a lot on the female warriors, who are supposed to be supporting characters. Instead, they often overshadow the Black Panther, making him look weak and unimportant. Don't get me wrong, I like the female army. They kick butt! However, they often appear stronger than the main character and he gets lost in the background at times.I can overlook most of it because every movie has its flaws. And had the story line been better, this movie would most likely have been 2018's big breakout! Monetarily, I'm sure it will do well. But I have a feeling it will be a one-time-only movie without repeat viewers spending their hard-earned money to get a second look before it goes to Redbox."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"This ""movie"" is just a sum of propagandistic scenes and lines. stupid dialogues stupid acting .. just no point of existance. i bet this movie is a test from goverments to see who is stupid enough to go pay and see this thing. avoid at all costs. watch it only if u are stoned and u wont remember nothing later.."
BLACK PANTHER,14 December 2019,2/10,I really wanted this to be great but the story made no sense whatsoever. Why can't they be more amenable to the lost son? Why are people suddenly so loyal to the new king. What a tedious misguided waste of a great opportunity.
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,1/10,Pretty terrible movie and cannot believe the mission of the bad guys was to kill an entire race of people.
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2019,1/10,"It's sad when people are idolising bad movies, just because they wear their skin colour.In UK the people that were cheering in the cinemas, hadn't seen a single MCU movie.
But guess what? They went to see this one... I wonder why! :P
I even overheard conversations when the post credits rolled like: ""oh they are making a movie called Avengers and Black Panther will return! We have to see this!""
People, this is just sad.There were other black heroes in the past before this one (i.e. Blade, which was amazing).
Please be more open minded.
Intelligent humans -regardless their colour- know that Black Panther was really bad.I like all kinds of GOOD art (music, movies, etc.) whether if its black, white, yellow or purple with blue stripes, I couldn't care less...I hope my comment doesn't get deleted as it has in other movie forums / pages.
This only proves that people are way too sensitive even when someone doesn't actually offends them. This is just a movie critic / review/ opinion. I would like to believe that freedom of speech still exists. Not to be able to express (always with respect) myself?
Well to me, that is real racism."
BLACK PANTHER,6 January 2019,1/10,"Normally I like most, if not all, Marvel movies and tv-series, so I am quite biased - but I found this movies so terrible bad, the acting, and the Disney like setup and story line. Hyped."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,3/10,"Strong candidate for the worst movie of the year.
Horrible casting;
Where the hell did they spend that budget?
And in the end it's a racist movie for morons.
Had to go out after about 80' coudn't stand longer..."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2018,8/10,"When a script is written with passion and heart, you can feel it..a satisfying feeling after finishing the movie..truely a storyline with a soul. I can't help but comparing this with Star Wars Last Jedi. The villain Killmonger is how the character of Kylo Ren should have been written. Even though Killmonger is the villain, he is still one of my favourite characters in the movie. He is a tortured soul that acts out of hatred and ends up on the wrong path, even though he thinks his actions are righteous. I also like the fact that they chose to play the Marvel Studios logo after his introduction in the start. It was a unique and different way to place the logo, compared to other Marvel movies. At first it seemed weird, but after watching the movie you understand the intention. As the camera zoomed away from the kids looking up at the sky, the logo plays, which marked the birth of the future villain Killmonger. That was the turning point, and when rewatching that scene, it just plays out perfectly. Such small details are true movie art, unlike Last Jedi which tries hard, but ultimately turned out pretentious. The rest of the cast are also terrific, and I like the fact that they didn't add any unnecessary humour. Two big thumbs up for this one."
BLACK PANTHER,26 October 2019,4/10,As a child I loved Marvel and in particular The Amazing Spiderman. The Black Panther was a cool dude who entered the stage on several occasions. This movie however had nothing of it unfortunately. Instead it was yet another PC movie coughed out by Hollywood. Why do they have to make everything about politics these days? The original comics had nothing to do with it. Very sad!
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"**SPOILERS**
Black Panther so far is one of the best MCU movies that I've seen to date. The musical score was on point and fit every scene, the set, the colors (One of the reasons why I enjoy GOTG and Thor Ragnorok) I wasn't expecting much humor in BP but I was pleasantly surprised by the small pockets and to me the small jokes and comments fit perfectly. I'm a big fan of a serious storyline mixed with a bit of humor and Ryan did just the right amount. For a movie spanning 2 hours, RG was able give us fascinating characters with well-written arcs out of huge cast and that's not an easy thing to do. 
We learn about T'Challa's rise as a king, wanting to follow his father's footsteps only to find out that his father made huge mistakes and those mistakes have consequences and T'Challa has to change his entire mindset of what it means to be a king.
Nakia's relationship with her homeland and the outside world. Ross had a totally different mindset of what he thought he knew. Eric Kilmonger is simply one of the best developed villains of the MCU. He made you care about him, even though he went about things the evil way. He killed his girl, just like that. But you understood why he was the way he was. 
Okoye with her principles and strict tradition but her eyes were opened that you cannot blindly defend something that is clearly wrong. Unfortunately, her love, W'Kabi was too blinded by the death of his parents to understand that. Even though he disagreed with T'Challa's method, he straight jumped to Kilmonger's side and I thought it was powerful moment when Okoye confronted him on the battlefield. 
Claw was a surprise, I didn't expect that, but he had his purpose and he made a big impression when he was on screen. When they walked through the metal detectors, that had me laughing cause he didn't give an F, lol.
Not a big fan of FW but hey, loved his role and he had been holding on to that guilt of King T'Chaka killing his own brother and leaving the son behind, a long time. When he sacrificed himself, it was for the best.
The Dora Milaje were just bad ass.
Shuri is that little sister that bugs the hell out of you but she's so cute, you can't help but love her, also she's smart as hell and I would love to see her go up against Tony Stark and bring his cockiness down a few notches. That would be fun to see.
Overall, it was entertaining, the music was great, the storyline kept my attention the entire time."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,10/10,"This movie fixes a lot of the old MCU problems. Well developed secondary characters, an excellent villain, very funny and developed setting."
BLACK PANTHER,10 December 2018,10/10,"We needed an uplifting movie like this, considering the times we live in. Another great addition to the Marvel franchise. More!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,10/10,"Just like 'Get Out', Black Panther is an artistic and commercial success for its authenticity! Filmmaking at its highest level. A must see event movie that gets better each time you see it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"Wow, I am really surprised at the hate in the comments. I saw this tonight and enjoyed every second of it. I loved the relationships between the characters, the multiple pressures against T'challa, the motivations of the antagonists, the overall themes. It was just a totally solid film and a hell of a good time."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,"I just want to say to people....DONT see this movie. Period.
Just becouse its a Marvel movie blind fan-boys hype it and give it a high rating.They movie started okey but 3/4 of the movie was just sloppy and bad CGI. It was transformers cgi but x10. So worthless.Dont see it, I dont have much to say really about the movie in general."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,1/10,It's just not what the score is. Lost my time watching it.
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,,"The truth is this movie is fantastic. It is a film that celebrates some of the most sacred building blocks of community and prosperity. Coogler, who is still fresh off the success of his two brilliant previous films (Fruitvale Station, Creed), returns with his most ambitious and rewarding film yet and I can personally guarantee that despite the obvious success he has ahead of him, this movie will forever be a jewel in Coogler's crown. Black Panther does so much to elevate not just what a superhero movie can be, but what it has the potential to say. Indeed, Black Panther's defining moments are not the action sequences (although they are breathtaking to say the least), but are truly the character moments, especially those that contribute to Black Panther's overall narrative which is to keep moving towards a brighter future, despite the darkness that may lie in the sins of the past. Chadwick Boseman dominates as both T'Challa and Black Panther. He manages to both say so much with an expression, and yet also beautifully put to words the complex struggles he faces over the course of the movie. And in complete honesty, Boseman does carry this movie on his shoulders. Luckily he has a phenomenal circle of deeply engaging and complex characters within his inner circle to lighten that weight. Letitia Wright as Shuri is a particular stand out as her wit and humour is guaranteed to make anyone with a beating heart smile. Danai Gurira is incredible as the ruthless Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o manages to accomplish such a gorgeous balance of guiding hand and warrior. But, when it comes down to it, this movie would not be what it is without Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. This is by far the best villain the MCU has ever had (yes even better than Loki). Jordan manages to be both merciless and cold hearted, all while emanating the rage and torture of being a man with nothing to lose, because everything he had has already been taken from him. You will both despise and want more of Killmonger and that is where a good villain should be. Finally, we must discuss the utter magnificence that is Wakanda. Black Panther displays its enthralling African kingdom with so much marvellous detail that it makes you wish it were a real place so you could hop on the next plane there. But beyond it's allure and beauty, Wakanda is a place of culture and tradition. While the movie easily could have skipped past the Wakandan world building, it is clear that those behind the camera were determined to give viewers a taste of a unique culture that also draws on so many ancient African elements, all while effortlessly blending it with colour, technology, and other more futuristic elements. One of my favourite things about this movie is that while it is clearly an MCU movie, it has nothing to do with the MCU besides the involvement of Klaue and the metal Vibranium. So, at no point in this film will you feel as if the movie is trying to build towards some other payoff in a different movie. This is Black Panther's movie and it is solely about his journey and what him and his people are going through. This makes the movie that much more captivating because it immediately allows the viewer to understand that they are watching a great film in general and not just a great MCU film. 
All in all I have to give Black Panther a 10/10 for being more than just a movie, but also a message and a movement."
BLACK PANTHER,15 August 2018,1/10,"I just can't believe positive reviews this movie got. I think I never watched such a bad, stupid and boring movie. It's just unwatchable."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,4/10,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have seen all of their movies within the first week they came out. I have to say this is probably one for the bottom 2 or 3 positions. The Good: The costume design and the premise for the settings is great, the characters are generic yet fun to watch, the tech and visual effects are superbThe Bad: The plot is riddled with plot holes, the plot itself is so generic especially the final accumulation of the film, I understand the need for social messages but the films forces them on you without really making you want to support the message being givenAll in all I would say watch it without expecting too much."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,9/10,"After reading so many reviews on this board and realising how critically blinded some people can really be, (all the haters with no real reason other than 'it's predictable': Like duh, it's a super hero movie not Shakespeare) it made me reflect on the real reason why we watch the hero flicks in the first place - it makes us feel good.If you want a description of the story you can visit wikipedia. This review is meant for the larger audience and why you should watch the film BUT not alone!I got a very rare opportunity to be invited to a private screening of Black Panther with the BlackNet community in Singapore by a very close friend of mine. This is the first time I've been to a screening where the excitement rolled out like Thunder on a bright sunny day: Loud, obvious and utterly fun! You can just feel the buzz of life and anticipation as you approach the theatre. People made an effort to dress up and turned up way before the show time to mingle and talk about theories and expectations about the film. So the film starts and this is my take on watching with the hyped crowd: absolutely brilliant.Yes, it is a classic story about good vs bad.
Yes, both good and bad has similar powers.
Yes, he's a black version of Iron man.
The comedy was on point and the one-liners were delivered by a brilliantly talented cast. Chadwick Boseman delivers an 'uncomfortably perfect' type of the Black Panther where even in his spiritual conflicts, he seems calm and clear headed on what he must do as King. Sure he may be a King but he hides being a man with emotional struggles very well; a little too well. (I find it strange that there didn't seem to be any flaw in his character but sure he's a King right?)
My favourite has to be Michael B Jordan's acting. KillMonger alone may have been a B-rated villain in the comics but it was Michael's portrayal of the Yellow Leopard that really bumped up his presence. More so, his backstory in the MCU is that of a trouble soul and it does reflect on today's current affairs where we see misguided individuals take matters into their own hands.Apart from the story and the casting, major props go to the beautifully designed sets. Wakanda looks amazingly believable and realistic: almost like our lives could be in the next 25-50 years. Costumes were very well designed and the CGI was original - I literally 'wow' seeing Black Panther's suit form around his body the first time.The rest of the cast members were equally fantastic and watching with the community, every punch-line was met with loud applause and unified appreciation. I believed the hype and I enjoyed it with them.As this is the last film before the big cumulation of the Avengers Infinity War, I urge all Marvel fans to watch this! Why you ask? Answer's simple: Vibranium"
BLACK PANTHER,15 April 2018,10/10,"I saw this movie opening weekend and my hopes were not as high as the hype. Honestly, it exceeded my expectations. The visuals were gorgeous and well thought out, as most Marvel movies are. The story line dealt with some very real spoken and unspoken issues across the Black Diaspora and their connections to colonization but it didn't handle those issues in a preachy way. The historical implications of this movie are clear and the determination to celebrate the beauty of Black skin and natural hair in the visuals was uplifting. I'd go see it again. I left the theater with my heart full and a bit changed."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Not only was Black Panther a film technically well-made - from the research, storytelling, visual effects, and, especially, the soundtrack - but Black Panther also made an impact. Despite some reviews calling it quite too ambitious (a fact that I did not see at all), it understood its role within the MCU and, quite obviously, society, which left moviegoers exiting the theaters with an agreeable praise. Personally, the best opinion that I have of Black Panther is that it had a plethora of great balance. It invited us into a world filled with African tradition while adding sci-fi nuances; I felt like I learned about classic African culture while simultaneously discovering advanced technology unlike anything I've seen before. The story was well-paced and did not, for one second, waste the potential of any of the characters. There were many players introduced into this complex story, but they all had a voice to play - just as we do - in a world crumbling due to political tensions (something quite prominent in this film haha) and a kingdom divided by a tradition and progress. In fact, I think the abundance of characters each holding onto what's important to them in such contentious times is what simplified the story. Each person eventually came to an internal understanding of their roles within Wakanda, which helped center the story back to King T'Challa. In turn, this leaves more gravitas on his controversial decisions as a new king.Killmonger (especially) is a character that lingers in my brain because he really embodies the victimized portrayal of ""the villain is the hero in his own story"". Despite being extremely belligerent and confrontational, he was a villain who is more centered than the average politician and has more purpose than many current world leaders. His arguments held truth, and I am 99% sure that the only reason that his ideals weren't executed was because he was too aggressive and not diplomatic enough. Killmonger makes a GREAT antihero to the untried King T'Challa because he made the newly crowned, untried, and demure T'Challa open his eyes to lives of the other 2 billion black people in the world. Consequently, this resolved T'Challa's inner strength and made him more politically adept; ironically, I'll even argue that Killmonger MADE his own foil by bringing out a diplomatic and resolute King T'Challa to Killmonger's brute and hostile nature. Killmonger left us with many thought-provoking statements about oppression, the role of blacks all over the world, and our duty as people (or kings) to help each other without being an overbearing character or compromising T'Challa's already burdened storyline on being a new king.In its own right, the film fits perfectly into our current societal climate and the Marvel Cinematic Universe - into this already complex sci-fi/magical world on the screen and the even more complicated world of reality.I could go on with the many, many well-executed aspects of this film. But just by watching the film, you don't need an overly long list or review to get the idea that because of the story, technical details, and a justified but respectful message, Black Panther definitely opens the identity of - and thus gives more voice to - modern black society."
BLACK PANTHER,1 February 2020,1/10,"The movie is boring, slow and way too emotional. Overall unconvincing acting over the whole line."
BLACK PANTHER,31 January 2019,2/10,"As VFX guy I kinda enjoyed it, but there was nothing for my soul. It felt like it is written just for FX guys to get job. I would probably enjoy this movie more without sound as some background video for some music."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,2/10,"I'm not a big reviewer but this movie needs it. After the hype my expectations was big. But this movie is the worst Marvel movie ever! It's a mess...The story of a Lion king, a James Bond, and some meaningless stupidity. 
It's a total waste of time! Conclusion: the Vibranium is good for everything except sidewalks!!!!They extremely advanced, they have Invisible Sonic Ships, but the walking in the dust! And the animal fences are made from sticks... ridiculous!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 April 2018,7/10,"The Black Panther (2018) is a film about superheroes. Whether it is different from other American films in the genre in terms of plot and tropes? I am not sure. In fact, it is full of clich√©s. I expected that the creators' will revert the Eurocentric worldview and the resulting power hierarchy, which it fails to do. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience to see positive and strong black heroes. In a generation that we all come to associate superheroes, from Jesus to Superman and Wonderwoman with white people, this is a big deal. The allows to imagine a world in which Europe or America is not seen as almost a divinely ordained centre of the world and the avant-garde of human civilization. Indirectly, it hints that all the races came from Africa, that Africa is actually the locomotive of human civilisation in historical retrospect. The film is, on another level, a brutal, yet superficial criticism of Euro-American imperialism, with all its nasty components from heritage stealing and colonising to coup-manufacturing and invasions. In an ironic fantasy world, the young King of Wakanda is fighting to death to prevent the distribution of state of art arms and technology to the world? Does anyone see the parallel? Yes, America is the biggest arm-dealer of the world with the most advanced military technology. Besides falling into the tropes of Western motives, such as seeking the treasure, having a CIA guy always onsite and so on, I think the film does a good job to make us think and critic the Eurocentric worldview and decolonise our minds. Of course, one has to understand the struggle of the Black Americans and centuries long racism and discrimination to understand the film. Watching the film, I recall being in the Museum of African-American Heritage in Washington DC with my black friend from Malawi, where I was feeling joy and anger at the same time. All in all the film failed me. I was hoping that the script writers and directors will bring the American revolutionary cousin (Killmonger) to unite the Wakandans, to ridicule the CIA guy and perhaps kick him out of Wakanda. Alas not. He is there to be demonised. Why are they portraying a CIA guy as an almost innocent lunatic with a baby-face? And a black revolutionary as a gangster and ultimately a monster who is there to destroy the world and disrupt the peace that the CIA is so eager to preserve? And, yes, Killmonger is right to ask: why the technologically advanced Wakandans are doing nothing for other people including Africans who suffer from poverty, instead they are content in their comfortable fantasy world.? It is not a caricature of the modern world. It is painfully realistic. The gap between rich and poor countries and rich and poor individuals has never been so greater, yet our Hollywood superhero is doing nothing to that end. He is happy with the state of affairs. He failed us just as Barack Obama failed every one of us sucking up to the power structure, doing nothing to stop American imperialism and overseas warfare."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"The best thing about this movie is it has villians in it that are relatable. How many superhero movies have such poor writing that they have to use heros against each other. This movie is different, original, and the cinematography is magnificent."
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2021,10/10,"Sadly due to everyone giving a miserable review regarding a good movie my review went from 8/10 to 10/10 ! Is this world filled with this much hate that a movie is 1/10 for overhype? Is the movie without a fair share of character development problems? No and it's not a perfect movie , However it's nowhere near as bad as a 1/10! I have watched movies that deserve 1/10 and this isn't one of them."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,This is a great movie from story line to cinematography. Finally a movie shedding a positive light on black people. It is great to have representation now but as Chadwick said if a white kid can look up to black panther as a hero then there is hope for us all. (Paraphrased)
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,10/10,This was the best marvel movie yet! Powerfull and meaningfull! A must see
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,2/10,"I watched this on the premise it will enrich and tie in with the MCU as I'm going to watch A:IW soon. What a waste of time. The characters are the definition of shallowness, poorly acted and not developed. The plot is ""MCU superhero script #6"". The visuals are great, which is now a standard for MCU movies, but they do not save the film. Nothing does. If Andy Serkis' character didn't die in the middle of the film, it would be more fun, as his character was the only thing interesting. One star for Andy Serkis. Martin Freeman is acting himself again. Chadwick Boseman feels like ""I'll just say these lines and go home"". Watch it for the sake of completeness, if you really need to, but you've been warned, as it adds nothing to the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,1/10,"I gave 1 score because 7.5 is just too much. Realistic score would be 6/10.
Watch it if really don't know what else to do with your life and you watched all of the other movies. Since you didn't watch, look for something else."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"Nothing new, bad movie to start with and bad movie to finish it."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,5/10,"I dragged my feet to see this movie after reading reviews and comments about the hype, video glitches and political undertone. However my lovely wife really want us to go. Well with me being pretty much in line with what us real people comment in IMDB I still didnt want to blow $40 on a movie night for a movie that may be a fail. So i watched it via a different venue. And I am glad I did. The first thing I want to say and my wife agrees is that the BS hype about how good this movie is was so bloated that it is clearly FAKE news. Good grief! Is that why it made so much money because so many went there thinking it was all that? First off, I didn't sense any covert political overtone, and wasn't bothered by it. The synergy between modern technology and the tribe culture was totally lacking. I mean the garbs and the wall decor just didn't go together well with the aircraft, building layout etc at all. The car chase scene was terribly weak, not sure what was missing...more collisions and/or explosions, I dont know. As far as the acting, no particular actor really jumped out at me, though I did like Letitia Wright, she brought in the much needed bits of humor. Not until the last few mins when Michael Jordan shows up at the tribe camp and starts to be the A-hole did the movie become interesting. If I compare this to a action movie like Skyfall there is no comparison. None. Nor does it come close to Thor or the Avengers movies so Marvel did themselves an injustice by putting their mark on this one. I don't know what to call it...a very weak action movie or a boring drama with a bit of action? And to think one of my co-workers said she went 3 times, and another went twice. When i think of seeing a movie two and three times, it would be something like Avatar, King Arthur, or any of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. I am just so glad that I didnt have to spend a dime to sit through this one. It fills the billet for a B movie to me. Shame on the media and critics for propping this flick up with HUGE pillars. Shame shame shame."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,5/10,"Not as good as 'Pink Panther' - not a bad movie, I just prefered the quirky humor of Chief Inspector Clouseau."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,9/10,"There is nothing entirely new about Black Panther compared to other super hero's movies. A sibling rivalry or a carbon copy villain are features from Green Lantern, the Hulk and X-men. So if you are looking for an entirely new take on the hero movie look elsewhere. If you are a fan of the MCU or the characters and comics it is based on than this movie is one of the best interactions in the universe so far. Black panther may focus on the life and struggles of King Techalla but the abundance of interesting and important supporting characters in this film is what makes it shine. While other films in the past have had interesting supporting rolls like captain americas squad of GI's or Thor's Lady skif and the warriors three, in these stories to me it always seemed like these characters were ether expendable or just not on the same level as the main character and the story could be completed without them. But in black panther the people of wakanda and the various tribal leaders are all quite important to the story and their interactions as well as the relationship between tchalla and his mother and sister add a depth to the film most superhero movies can't attain"
BLACK PANTHER,7 October 2019,3/10,Looking forward to watching and finished with disappointment.
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2019,1/10,The movie has been way over hyped. The acting was way over the top for the most part. I felt like I was watching a Spike Lee film with all the racial agenda. It felt like a black power movie more than a Marvel film. It was a once and done film but truth be told this is not a must watch to follow the Avengers saga. If you do not watch this film it will have no affect on your understanding of the Avengers movies.
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,10/10,"Representation matters.
The movie was amazing from the soundtrack straight to the action and narration."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,10/10,"I am actually from the continent. Moved here a few years ago.this movie wa sbwyond amazing to me. Often times people make movies based on the continent and get it wrong, it makes me so agitated and confused while watching. This one ticked every box. I was so worried about them getting the culture and mannerisms right and boy did they deliver!!!!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,10/10,"Wow! I find it very interesting that most of the reviews that are posted 90% of the reviewers did not even see the movie. As a long time fan of the Black Panther, in my opinion Marvel got it right. It a sad testament of today's thinking that people are so malicious and limited minded that they have to resort to tactics to give bad reviews based on fear and ignorance. Watch the movie for yourself and decide for yourself whether you like or dislike the film. I understand people who just did not care for this genre, fine I get that, but if you are doing this because of some predisposed thinking then go back to you ignorant holes where you come from! It seems to me any film or literature that shows any people of color in a positive light some people out there take it as a threat to their way of life. Think for yourselves people and maybe we all could get a lot done in this world."
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,6/10,Expected alot more from this given all the hype not one of marvels best
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Unlike other recent Marvel movies this wasn't a joke fest. It had a great story line and introduced the character very well. The story also stand alone great so you don't need to be a Marvel fan and have seen the other MCU movies. The action was top notch like we would expect from Marvel and the acting is great too. The bad guy is being said to be a best bad guy in a comic movie. I don't know about that but he was good. Joker, doc oc, Loki and Ronin have been my favorite bad guys."
BLACK PANTHER,3 August 2018,2/10,"Poor quality in directing , acting and accent is terrible, no story , such a waste of time"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,I was excited for this movie ever since it's announcement and the final result did not disappoint! The characters and their individual emotional investment were all so bold and the actors eloquently presented this wonderful superhero tale. I cannot wait until I can see it again!.
BLACK PANTHER,12 April 2019,2/10,"There was the potential there for a very good movie, but the story line had so many holes in it, the acting was hit and miss and there was nothing holding it together.Considering all the hype, it was a tremendous disappointment based on the story alone."
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,4/10,"After all of the box
Office hype, I expected this movie to be great ...... average at best. Maybe not even"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,Pretty much that. Around 80% of the good stuff is on the trailer :/
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,10/10,Great cast great music amazing visuals and mind Blowing Scores from Ludwig G√∂ransson. The Movie felt a bit slow at the beginning but it was all for a good reason. This is one of those movies where you don't want to miss any scenes. Because almost all the scenes from the movie are filled with VFX if not all of them. Chadwick's performance was outstanding. And so was the rest of the cast. One thing we marvel fans always look up to while watching a Marvel movie is the ENDING CREDITS. Oh my god! This one has by far the best ending credits Marvel has ever made. Just too good! This is a movie worth watching more than once.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,4/10,"That's why you do not believe in the critics, if they say you excellent! it is because it is very bad"
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,5/10,"An average film. 
Predictable plot and not the best action movie of the year as so many people have led us to believe. 
The action was average with no one performance really standing out for any awards. The Special effects were good but that's about it.I was looking forward to this film but ended up dissatisfied and disappointed. So many better films I could have spent my money on."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,5/10,"First things first, the culture and music of Black Panther was fantastic. I was wowed with their great way of blending African culture to the modern technology with the signature building and the ""mask"" plane with were genius design and all. The place was well designed and the deep culture was very believable. Moreover, the moment when Killmonger set foot in Wakanda, the music also changed, signifying the intrusion of him by starting mixing hip hop to tribal rhythm. All the technology was awesome and the black cast was top notch. Every tribes seems to have their own signature technology too. Micheal B Jordan was awesome as a villain and the scene with Killmonger and his dad was gold. However, ....In before the next part, I am sorry guys, I really wanted to like Black Panther, after so many good reviews and hype from you guys, but I just could not. I probably get tons of downvotes and salt for this too.The plot is just weird, it seems alright but part of me feels like I'm watching a cut version without some further scene to explain the plot for me.Some stuffs:Ok, King T'Chaka:The former BP was forced to kill his younger brother because of his radicalization. N'jobu, his brother, was informing Ulysses Klaue, a criminal, about Wakanda and told him where can he attacked to get the Vibranium.After killing his brother, he then proceed to leave, without any checking the room for notes, documents or information about Wakanda or his brother's colleagues. Furthermore, he also left the body behind for the cops to find and expose his kingdom to the world. ?The museum heist:Wow, a stealth heist, with great beginning, surprise, poisoning, hostages.... BANG. Everyone dies!!!What? So why don't you storm in there, steal the Vibranium, then leave on an ambulance, seems still okay to me. Why planned a heist like that ended up in a robbery.The Korean casino.So the US wanted the most valuable metal in the world, Vibranium, and they had to buy it from a shady criminal, what should they do? Oh, send 1 single man to buy it, without guards, without planning, without extract points, in a fishy casino is SK.After the casino:It seems that Klaue miraculously survived a horrible accident with barely any injury. Cool, now let's capture him and hold him in the least secured room in the police station with nothing behind the wall and hope that he does not brings any friend with him that may rescue him. So it seems all Wakandans were just extra careless when it comes to putting Klaue behind bars.Killmonger, aka Erik, aka N'Jadaka, who was N'jobu's son was a highly trained professional soldier, an undercover agent, a war veteran who was perfect in every way.Is this not another Mary Sue/Marty Stu thing?An important character with a tragic past now excel in every aspect in his life, overcome great odd and carry a mission for redemption of his past and takes vengeance to those who wronged him?I have not lived in US yet, but it seems to me, a son of a criminal, now dead, with mom seems to be not in the picture much, can advance so much while hundred thousand of others kids with same fate ended up worse.I am not saying he has no opportunity to do these things, it was just so convenient and easy to set him up like that to make him a badass villan and not very realistic too.Erik, killing Klaue:So Erik killed Klaue to earn some credit from the Wakandan, right? So why he had to struck a deal with Klaue before, seems to be no reason at all. He could just meet Klaue, kill him, come back to Wakanda, and earn some trust.The weird loyalty of Wakandan:"" We will serve whoever sit in that throne, no matter how evil, foolish, dickhead they are"". That is what I see in the political situation in Wakanda. Seriously, it is a miracle that this country has not ended up killing each other in civil war or destroyed themselves with Vibranium.The Heart Shape plant:So this plant gives people super power physically exceeding normal human. Cool. And let's not grow it any where else except this tiny room. In addition, when Killmonger was there, he just seems to be alright with burning the whole things down without thinking about consuming more to be stronger or giving his people this plant so they can rise up themselves.The society:Who get chosen to be outside herding sheep and who will have the right to stay in the technological advanced city. It is just unfair for people outside.W'kabi:Saying he is super loyal to the king 5 mins before he betrayed everything he knows including his long time friend and his lover with a strange dude who was born outside and also conveniently killed his nemesis. HmmmmShuri:The whole kingdom's technology innovation lays in the hands of a 16 years old girl without any other older person/scientist in sight. HmmmT'Challa to Killmonger after the big fight:""I know you tried to kill me, my mom, my sisters (for fun), my friends, turned the country up side down, probably also plotted to overthrow world's governments, ignite social turmoil, and take over other's nations. But I will let you live.""To me, this moment, every character development, conflicts, ideology clash were rendered meaningless. The king did not learn.T'Challa to the world:Yes, Wakanda will open to the world, but please also notice that this nation's government is a totalitarian monarchy which leaders elected by a Mak'Gora or a fighting ritual where one can be beaten to dead. We are not barbarian at all.And also some other things:Most of the fight was in night time, and the characters were mostly black or in black suit. It just hard to concentrate on the fight. Shaky cams were horrible too.A private plane flies from South Korea to Central Africa? NiceShuri was also kinda Mary Sue imoThe ""Sneakers"" was never mentioned again in the movie. Shame.Killmonger's motive was good at first, then turned into weird racial politics with no convincing reason at all.The Rhino seems to be able to identify friends from foes who actually were allies, too.Predictable, but in MCU it is okay.Too much CGII loved Thor: Ragnarok, it was a fun movie with exciting moments and fair storyline, but Black Panther did not achieve the same level as Ragnarok. Maybe I went to the cinema with my high hopes and expectation which was failed to be met. I thought a lot about writing this down because it seems contradict with almost everyone's opinion. On IMDB, the movie was first rated 7.1, the a massive influx of 10 pulled the rating to 7.9 where it is sitting right now. For me, this movie deserved a 6/10 at best."
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,5/10,"This movie taught me a good lesson. the lesson is never ever to fall for a movie hype. Even if it is a blockbuster super duper hit, Even if it is from mighty marvel.
Thanks, goodbye and goodnight!Movie story: 1/10

BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I am very happy that director Ryan Coogler does not hide his politics in this movie. ""Black Panther"" celebrates African culture, Pan-Africanism, and Black Power with stunning visuals and excellent fight scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing African-American women portrayed as highly intelligent and strong. Almost anyone who loved the female warriors in ""Wonder Woman"" will really enjoy the fierce African-American female warriors in this film. I also like that the film does not reduce the fictional Wakanda to an African utopia. ""Black Panther"" shows intertribal conflict and violence.Overall, Black Panther is a highly entertaining and somewhat politically ""woke"" film. I do not know if typical Marvel comic books fans will appreciate the movie's very visible political agenda. I do know that the movie has broken box office records and that Hollywood executives worship profits. ""Black Panther"" appears to become a highly profitable venture for Disney. Perhaps this movie's success will prompt Disney to make and distribute more movies that feature African-Americans and other people of color as superheroes. ""Black Panther"" demonstrates that highly political comic book adaptations can be very profitable. I think that is a very good thing."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,5/10,"As a neutral viewer, the story and screenplay very predictable and lacked emotional connect. At least the accent could have been African American. Ragnarok had predictable storyline but caught up with witty screenplay. Disappointed after all that hype."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther...stunning visuals, great action sequences, a more personal storyline was much welcomed in the MCU, some wonderful support characters who steal more than a few scenes...and yet...well....T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman...hmmmm....dare I say, a bit boring as the main character...not even in the top 10 of enjoyable characters in this movie! Definitely worth seeing though!!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther is Not Just Another Superhero Flick with the Typical Marvel Formula for its other Solo Movies, Directed By the Amazing Ryan Coogler Who is Known for his Critically Acclaimed Movies ""Fruitvale Station"" And ""Creed.
The Movie Takes place 1 Week After the Events of Civil War,Where T'Challa is mourning his father's death as he takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a fictional African nation ""hiding in plain sight"". But Things Shake Up When Movie's Main Erik Killmonger Played By Michael B. Jordan Comes into the Narrative Which Slowly Becomes one of the Best things about the Movie. Erik Killmonger's Motivation And intentions is Much More Deep And Complex Than showed in the trailer. One Of The Best Things About This Movie is how Every character from T'Challa , Killmonger to Other Supporting Characters is Really Well Written.
Coogler Doesn't Shy Away away from Breaking the Normal Superhero Theme Mould And Takes the writing into an Interesting Direction And Wins Another Gold For Marvel, Also the Movie Has Stunning Visuals And Badass Action Sequences.
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa Or Black Panther is amazing in his Role And His Chemistry With Letitia Wright Who plays his Sister Shuri is a Delight to Watch. Other Actors Like Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue), Angela Bassett,Lupita Nyong'o,Danai Gurira,Daniel Kaluuya,Martin Freeman,Florence Kasumba Does Jobs but it's Michael B. Jordan Who Steals The Show With his Portrayal Of Erik Killmonger.
A Special Mention to Kendrick Lamar For His Great Soundtrack Which Lights up Every Single Scene Whenever it plays on the Screen."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,5/10,"I really think this is NOT a good movie. However, many people will be able to enjoy this kind of movie.The plot is shallow, no character depth, no emotions. And a lot of plot holes. Characters are stereotyped and cliche in a boring way.Overall, this is a typical no brain entertainment movies for people who want some kind of light-hearted entertainment, no need to think, just watch the colorful fighting movie , have some fun at the cinema and forget all afterward; then they may enjoy this movie.The high-tech African community in this movie is so American cliche. Many reviews pointed out this. That's why I don't think Wakanda is cool.Personally, I don't like this movie at all. I even become to hate it because of the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,15 July 2018,1/10,"Boring movie - I was inclined to stop watching after 10 minutes and had a second go but not sure if I made it half through. No storyline and flat dialogues. 
Black people with bad English accent and dressing like native Africans performing rituals. I personally didn't find this flattering to put it mildly.
How did this movie get good critics and awards?"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"I've been excited to see Black Panther for a while but had no idea just how much I'd enjoy it. It's hard to decide which details to praise first. This film was strong but graceful. The fight scenes were intense. In every scene, the visuals had my full attention. Everything from the color schemes of the outfits to the contrast between the real Wakanda and what the outside world sees, was so well thought out. Hairstyles were so intricate on some characters but the women who didn't have hair wore their baldness so beautifully. Seeing the deep strength of the female characters sent a surge of energy through me. It was nice for once to see women on an equal plain to the men and not to be silenced when speaking boldly. The mixture of high tech/ modern gadgets and tribal outfits/rituals seemed to send a message that holding on to traditions while moving forward is important for strength and survival of a nation. I've been very careful to avoid spoilers but it's been pretty hard considering the many details that stood out to me. Whether you're a comic book/superhero fan or not, I would recommend this film to just about anyone who loves a powerful story with a subtle laugh every so often."
BLACK PANTHER,25 September 2019,5/10,"Very average and quite boring. The setting in Africa is colorfull, but clearly a unrealistic fantasy version of the continent. The acting is done well, but the fake accents are anoying, the story is bland, the action even blander and the CGI ending is well, terrible. If this was a movie with a standard Hollywood cast, the critics would't praise this at much as they did now. Too bad they did, because of the reviews I thought I was in for a treat and all I got was a bore."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,1/10,"Don't bother Wasting your time watching this overhyped piece of crap.
I have a nice fence in the garden if you want to come around and watch that dry instead. I don't normally write reviews but this was so bad it needed one.Dull, boring, badly written,"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,After a lot of advertising this movie i think this will be something like Iron man or like Superman but this is so boring and bad work.
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2019,1/10,Worst Marvel movie in my opinion. Absolute garbage.
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,10/10,Obsessed. This is worth the hype. I think that this film is a must see and totally great for any audience irrespective of age. I am a true fan and might even see it again!
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,1/10,"aA smartly executed business gimmick (which is now $500million) to serve a blend of the undisputed favourite, DC's Bruce Wayne on top of yesteryears' critically acclaimed academy award winners 12 Years A Slave and Moonlight, which compassionately dealt with the prejudice against the community. 
Yet, Black Panther fails to give me a high.
The movie makers weren't sure whether they wanted to cash in over the geo-political happenings around the world or to honestly bring us entertainment. Unfortunately, it still manages to be self proclaimed best marvel, in fact the best superhero movie, as far as the B.O. numbers are going to due hype created by professional and politically influenced critics.Its neither the first black superhero movie (wait! wasn't Hancock a superhero?)
nor the first movie with an entire black cast(what about Straight Outta Compton?). 
Besides, for covering up the ""blurry stationary flaws"", they say that one shouldn't judge it as it deals with elevating the oppressed. Really?My dear friends! there is no such thing as ""upliftment of the downtrodden"" or ""being champion of the underdog"" in these 2 hours. Instead, if the film is losing something, its the emotions.On contrary to your presumption, here King T'Challa, throughout his spectacle, is obsessed with trying to set up his monarchy over Wakanda. He ensures that no outsider, no matter who he is, ascends the throne. The only moment you see a righteous statesman in him, is when you see him confronting his father for murdering his uncle.
The antagonist, in contrast, depicts an orphan, poor, homeless and unguided kid with a motive, which although disturbing, forces us to relate him with an underdog.If kids are looking out to watch this movie to gain self confidence to deal with social taboos, I suggest them to better see documentaries/videos of modern day achievers like Serena, Usain or Oprah, who tackled the taboos which an average black youth faces every day.
Coming back to the movie, the only praiseworthy thing I felt is the strong portrayal of female characters, which seem no lesser than the protagonist. The only place where they find themselves behind the protagonist, is in the title of the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2018,2/10,"Ten minutes in and I was bored. No character development, plot, etc. Predictable in every way."
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2021,1/10,Instead of picturing real Black Panters who fought for their communities this movie shifts public focus into an imaginary world with overpowered heroes. That won't remind anyone about still imprisoned leaders of real-world Black Panters.
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,8/10,"This film was brilliant, but did it live up to the hype?
I went into black panther expecting little, this is comparable to films such as Ant Man and Dr. Strange, both of which I was pleasantly surprised by, I feel this is because they were unknow, almost like underdog heroes when it comes to the MCU.
For me black panther started off a little slow, granted it was necessary for the story development and did show off some of the power and gadgets they have to offer. The moment Michael B. Jordan made his appearance was where things started to get exciting. Seeing him playing the role of antagonist was amazing, the way that killmonger was played, in my eyes, was perfect, the way he looks, his story of vengeance, his attitude towards Wakanda and how he feels it develop the world. A great rival to the black panther and the Wakandan throne.
Now, having praised the primary villain, I need to comment on Ulysses Klaude. The most useless character in this film... not at all needed. I understand he provided a bit of comic relief, and I'm not going to deny he was slightly entertaining but personally I would have liked to have seen more development of killmonger than Ulysses, thankfully he doesn't last too long.
Having said this, I do think that the casting featuring some of the better young talents featured in black mirror, Danial Kaluuya and Letitia Wright, was outstanding, when they were on the screen they stole the show. Shuri, played by Letitia, provided huge amounts of humour, but also showed how strong she and all the females of Wakanda were, very empowering. 
Martian Freeman, I'm not going to say a lot about him, however I think what they've done here is take a character who for the most part was disliked in Civil War, and made him much more likeable, just developing him a bit more. Even if I still can't get past the terrible accent.
The special effects featured in this, in one word, outstanding. I think that they did a brilliant job of making this visually stimulating city, hidden under a mountain, showing Africa as we know it but having huge developments, sky scrapers and huge technological advancements. Despite there being these huge structures and it almost being like a first world country, they did a remarkable job of portraying the culture over there, from the costume design to the amazing sound track
Having praised the actors and SOME of the characters, I still feel that this film was missing a lot, considering the film was over 2 hours long, not a lot really happened. and the first half was pointless because it was about Ulysses, a side villain, who end up dying anyway. After that pointless side quest the main story starts and just feels far too rushed. Everything happened over the space of about half an hour.
I came out satisfied with this film, you don't go into a MCU film expecting an Oscar nominated film, despite this film being nominated. It was fun, like all Marvel films and fitted into the Cannon quite well. I like Black Panther as a hero and look forward to seeing him in Infinity War. like a lot of films, it sometimes takes time to appreciate aspects you don't see at the time of watching, engrossed in the story. Like the amazing colours, music and effects it brings, not to forget how amazing the characters were. Sure, it lacked a bit of substance, but I can get over that by knowing how as far as visuals are concerned it was a masterpiece. If anything, id argue that this is underhyped, some people just can't reflect and see this for the artwork that is it.
At the end of the day id give Black Panther 8/10."
BLACK PANTHER,1 February 2021,6/10,"I wasn't really familiar with the Black Panther character prior to seeing this movie, so I didn't really have high expectations for excitement for it. The reviews were over the top for this movie, mostly it seems, because of the black lead, black director, etc. I don't care what color anybody is, I just want to be entertained. Black Panther did not keep me entertained. Some interesting story lines and characters, but overall, I didn't enjoy it. CGI, especially the fight scenes, wasn't great. I would place it somewhere in the middle of the pack of all the Marvel films."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"Unfortunately, February is where big budget mediocre/poor movies dwell. Black Panther fits this description. If this movie had not received the ridiculous build-up, it would have died quickly at the theaters. They had an interesting concept to work with, but I cannot remember when I have seen such uninspired, even boring, fight scenes. Nothing original other than location. One of the most predictable movies you will ever see. Watch the first 20 mins and you will know the rest of the story to the end. The one real bright spot of the film was Letitia Wrights portrayal of Shuri. She is a delight to view on screen. Hopefully, like Captain America, the first Black Panther will be considered a throw away, and they will get better in additional installments."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,1/10,"If there was ever an over hyped movie, this was IT
I started watching it with great expectations but could not get pass 40 minutes into it.
I kept thinking ""it gets better"". Nah!I think human centipede 2 could have been a better choice to waste my time,,,"
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2019,10/10,The sence that shows Victoria Falls give the movie more action
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,8/10,"For being on the right side of history, for once. the cast were FLAWLESS and the costume department killed it, yass queen. even the soundtrack was fire."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2018,9/10,"There are a lot of mixed opinions on this movie. I enjoyed it on the big screen - enough to see it twice, which is rare, so it seems appropriate to mention why.First, what is not new or surprising:
it is based on a comic book character;it is in the Marvel universe;it has a comic book cast and plot [read: big plot holes].It you went to see this, looking for the next Avengers blockbuster special effects, then you are early - that is coming out later this year. And so you would be somewhat disappointed: no aliens, no space ships, very human antagonist, yet all the normal comic book plot holes are there to see...On the other hand, approached with an open mind, this was an interesting insight in to a very different world. You learn about the back story and character of the Black Panther, his weaknesses, his strengths and his commitment to his people. You see a messy aspect of his family history resolved. And then, too, you are exposed to a completely new culture - even though the Marvel view of African culture is as sanitised as civilian life in the big US cities, it is very much in that mold, with richness and depth and traditions on display or alluded to throughout.Yes, there are plot gaps, some personalities are under developed, odd storylines start and stop a little randomly; the lighter tone and mix of humour is not for everyone either. So, that cost it a star in my eyes.The film is visually stunning, approachable by families, brings considerable talent to the screen and is a thoroughly enjoyable step up from a pure action flick."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,10/10,"Sounds like a lot of disappointed DC fan reviews. They did have an article where DC fans were going to try to kill the reviews. This IS the movie that kills DC. Character development was there, action was there love story but not main focus. M.B. Jordan did an awesome job and the casting was perfect. Marvel has definitely mastered the fight scenes. My biggest concern was Disney was going to push for it to be to kiddy. Marvel/Disney awesome job. It's why your over a billion $!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,4/10,"So this film for me is as if the lion king was written in the perspective of scar. It's almost like the script of the lion king was a jigsaw and the writers just mashed the prices together. That's the story... Don't get me started on the acting! So all these people are from the same (albeit made up) country, you wouldn't know this from the broadness of the accents. Are we in South Africa? Or Ethiopia? Or Jamaica?! I made the mistake of believing the critics, this is no where near a 10/10 film. But if you know that before you watch you might just enjoy it"
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2019,5/10,"It's entertaining but has the same plot as majority of superhero movies. Becomes hero, loses powers, then overcomes to become hero again. I understand the importance of this film as it is one of the only colored superhero's to be on the big screen but sadly it does not reach any new highs story, character or visually."
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,,"I made the mistake of buying this trash based on what a lot of people who had seen the movie in theaters had said. Do yourself a favor and read a few reviews on here before you pay for this movie, these critics aren't lying.Storyline = Trash
Acting = Trash
Characters = Trash
Special effects = Trash 
Pretty colors = good jobIf you choose to waist your time on this movie, please don't waist your money, wait for Netflix to show it.Black Panther, stick with the Avengers, you aren't a solo act."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,10/10,"This movie has it all when it comes to a cool superhero movie! Its diverse, its action-packed, it is very funny and at the same time manages to be serious when it needs to be. I loved Boseman, Jordan and all the other actors involved in this franchise, but my true love from this movie was the soundtrack that Kendrick Lamar put together as well as the original score. If this movie does not get any recognition next year, something is wrong! :)"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a property that Marvel should have used a long time ago. He's a great character with an interesting back story.Finally he's firmly established in the MCU.I'll keep this brief. The story was GREAT, the acting AMAZING, the action FANTASTIC, the movie was MOVING.This film deserves all the praise it is receiving. For Wakanda!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,5/10,"Here's why ""Black Panther"" is incredible:1) It's a cultural movement and it is about time. 
There is understandably a lot of hype because it is a mainstream-marketed superhero movie that features an mainly black cast. This shows that Hollywood finally acknowledges that they should cater to everyone on the market and is a indicator of the significant changes society has gone through and the representation in this movie is an absolute gem to witness.2) It seeks out stereotypes and breaks them. 
In lieu with being a cultural movement, it is a Hollywood movie that finally presents African countries in a positive light while also dispelling myths of tribes being backwards, as well as some mystic being ""all-knowing"" because they're so in touch with nature. Letitia Wright's character, Shuri, is the biggest breaker of stereotypes here, but a special shout-out to making Forest Whitaker's character, Zuri, more than your standard ""mystic man"" as well.3) The costume and set design was literal art. 
Kudos to the costume department for thinking through the symbolism of every tribe and person represented and for having their vision for each character (even background or minor ones) shine through.4) Shuri, General Okoye and Killmonger. 
They stole the show. King who? Black Panther who? All of the actors were actually pretty good, but Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan were exceptionally good. Actually, every single character felt decidedly more interesting to follow than T'Challa. I now wish I had gone to see a ""Nakia: Super Warrior Liberator Spy"" movie rather than Black Panther.
Now here's why Black Panther is an average movie at best and counting its cultural significance as a positive:1) Its protagonist is literally the driest and most bland character in the movie. 
Despite Chadwick Boseman being a good actor, he wasn't given much to work with. I don't remember T'Challa's struggle nor his character progression in this movie, because he was written with only one apparent struggle but nothing that seemed deep enough that a day's worth of contemplation for T'Challa couldn't fix. In the movie, T'Challa's character is mostly used as a tool to clash against Michael B. Jordan's incredible work as Killmonger. It does not do well to have a superhero movie where we can't even remember the struggle of the title character.2) The story is bad.
The story in this movie is so bland, predictable and it doesn't even offer any kind of resolution. The movie has so many world issues it wants to address, but never quite manages to do anything besides skim the very surface of and not even that goes well. It tries to highlight that Killmonger seeks revenge on the whole world for slavery and imperialism; but then never really addresses its complexities, the effect it has had on history nor does it explore the morale behind Killmonger's vision ever again (you get a cop-out to this issue if you stay for the after-credits scene or watch Infinity War). It tries to address that Wakanda is a prosperous nation with its own privileges and yet the nation doesn't help its own neighbors; the movie then also never addresses this issue again, except for offering said cop-out in the after-credits scene. It tries to address the issue of many African tribes being hung up on tradition as a hindrance; then also never addresses this issue again. Everything is left hanging in the air and there is never really a resolve. This is a superhero movie, we expect a resolution of some sort, even if that resolution has a negative impact.3) It's not even a good superhero movie.
While I appreciate my drawn-out and serious dramas, I went in expecting a superhero movie. I felt like I showed up, prepared for entertainment and was rewarded with... a kind of cool scene action scene at the end? Sadly, it wasn't even when our protagonist was fighting the antagonist in the inevitable last standoff, it was when our beloved General Okoye was on the battlefield. With the exception of Shuri and General Okoye not much of this movie felt remotely superhero-like. I would not have held this against a movie normally, but if I'm expecting a superhero movie, I actually want to see some really cool action scenes. It's like they promised me James Bond and I got some dweeby half-limp noodle CIA operative (Wait, Martin Freeman's character, is that you?).4) The CGI.
It's just bad. They overused it and whenever Chadwick Boseman was presented as Black Panther, I had a slight PSTD flashback of watching Legolas jump on stones in mid-air in The Hobbit.5) The writing is horrible.
Except for a few one-liners (you get a pun or two besides what is shown in the trailer) the writing feels stunted and weird. It just feels very off, even with the added filter of me understanding that I am a European and thus ""out of the loop"" in terms of how the cadence of jokes or tonal use of African languages (I think it was Xhosa?) usually is delivered. The dialogue is what makes this movie forgettable: There is sensation of a real struggle between any characters except for in Killmonger's case. They could have played on the struggle between General Okoye's duty to her country opposed to her love for Daniel Kaluuya's character, W'Kabi. They could have highlighted Shuri's frustrations of elders looking down on her nontraditional way of life, they could have shown more of the struggle that Winston Duke's character, M'Baku and his tribe has gone through. There were so many missed opportunities and while many things can be derived by context and implicit meaning, the language used between the characters never felt right. This resulted in a general feeling of indifference and I would have felt no inclination to be on Wakanda's side, had it not been for Shuri and General Okoye (and even Lupita Nyong'o's character, Nakia, has me feeling a bit skeptical).Overall, I understand the hype and the significance of this movie, but it is not a good superhero movie. The cast, crew (except for a select few: I'm looking at you, CGI-folks) and score has done an amazing job but somehow the writers have done them dirty and it has resulted in an overall forgettable movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2020,9/10,"This movie tells a story of T'Challa and his struggle of becoming a king. The performances are all amazing, especially from Michael B. Jordan as Erik. He did a fantastic job. Chadwick Boseman is also very good as T'Challa.The visual are impressive as always and director Ryan Coogler did an amazing job at directing. The city of Wakanda is beautiful and this movie makes me interested in the culture of Wakanda.The motivation of the villain is clear, he's not just a bad guy who wants to take over the world or that kind of typical, bland villain. We actually understand his motivation and why he is doing what he is doing. We understand where he came from and that's what makes a great villain.The action sequences are all of course amazing and beautifully shot. This is a must see, don't miss this movie guys!I would definitely recommend this to all of of you out there, especially if you are a marvel fans. Wait until the end! There are 2 after credits scenes and they are worth it."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,1/10,"Amazing how companies have learned to market their crappy products and/or services. Over time, these companies have learned to rig the marketing system. Take Amazon, for example where you might see a product rated 4.5-5 stars with 3000+ reviews; How can you questions the quality & performance of that product. I'll tell you how: You order it and see it for yourself. This is exactly the same situation here. After seeing exceptional reviews & ratings for Black Panther, I had to see the movie. Boy, It was a huge disappointment to see the low production & direction quality of the movie. I'll second another reviewers point: ""..just a bunch of senseless fighting and meaningless story line.""Do not waste your time and money watching this movie (and I don't mean just in the theater...I mean watch it at all on DVD or other formats)."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"'Black Panther' is an excellent film from beginning to end. Superb storytelling, acting, and visuals."
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2018,1/10,"Worst movie of the year. No band. Not believable, even in comic Lanh. Come on Marvel !"
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,1/10,"Having attempted to watch this once before and failed, I tried again due to its nod at the Oscars thinking maybe I hadn't given it a fair chance.It really was a disappointment end to end, bar some of the visuals it was certainly one of the worst Marvel films I've seen, and I think it's fair to say none of which were Oscar worthy in the best picture category (other categories maybe). It's a big shame that other genuine brilliant movies would have missed out on their chance of an award due to this.If it's taught me anything, it's that the Oscars are no longer relevant and should be ignored. Perhaps also many of the major film review sites as the ratings must be artificial, hopefully that gets exposed at some point as it would be questionable ethically if not also false advertising..."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,2/10,"Nothing special, Meh... What is the big deal, I don't understand.. Is it the accent?? Is it the story (can't be!!)??"
BLACK PANTHER,19 September 2018,1/10,We where so hyped about the black panter.....after seeing the movie we wher so disappointed
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2021,9/10,"Sure it's bland, mediocre, over-hyped, and lacking any real depth. But that's the same for all of the Phase 3 and 4 Marvel films.
What sold it to me was the majority African cast and more women in important roles. Both of which have been lacking in action films for a long time.
Add to that the beautiful panoramas and the view of a Utopian African society and I'm all for it.So yeah, it is as mediocre as every other superhero film but it's mediocre with a different demographic. I'm all for an update to the regular cast look."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Nothing new, just same comic book formula with great special effects and poor story/acting"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,7/10,"To be honest the hype got to me a little when walking into this movie and after watching it, I can say it doesn't totally live up to it. Don't get me wrong it's a well made movie but just like some Marvel movies in the past it doesn't do anything new. Sure it shows off African culture but other than that it is still the same film we've seen over and over again. What I do like about this movie is how character driven it is as opposed to just being filled with action scene after action scene. The characters are pretty good for the most part however I did feel that Black Panther himself was probably the most boring which is a shame because he was so great in Civil War. All the actors do a good job and I never felt like anyone stood out in terms of bad performances except for Michael B. Jordan who seemed to phone it in some times. A lot of the problems in this movie are due to inconsistencies. For the sake of not spoiling anything an example I would use are the special effects which range from good to downright terrible. In the end Black Panther is a character driven film with beautiful scenery, good characters, and great acting but the story isn't anything new and there are some major inconsistencies."
BLACK PANTHER,23 July 2018,10/10,Possibly the best marvel movie made with its innovative soundtrack and solid acting all around. The villain is possibly the best yet in marvel and one of the best in all superhero movies. Also sets up more to come with characters seeded deep into its story that will have a lot more to do with sequels.
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,10/10,"I don't see why people are whining in this review section. All these recent reviews are more like ""Dude, most people are saying this is best. So, lets put some shit here and tare down the ratings"". All reviews by such people are just made up. Yes, I am a marvel fan but no I am not biased. Every movie with a son mourning for father's death scene will not make it a lion king and the plot is not way related to lion king. As ever marvel did a fantastic job with the characters but I would jab it for the awkward accent of wakanda (still kinda acceptable). Other than that, I don't find any thing that provoke me to call this a disgusting movie.
In short, Black panther is a great movie to watch with great performances of both cast and crew. Actually I never give 10 but just to outweigh these comments by people with digestion problem, I had to. Else i would give it an 8. I accept its not the best movie of Marvel franchise but still it wasn't half bad and on par with the good movies of MCU"
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,3/10,Over hyped movie that had poor CGI and a predictable ending
BLACK PANTHER,28 July 2019,1/10,"I've watched this movie when it came out and I remember dozing off in the theater a couple of times. The plot is just moronic, the dialog is boring, the CGI is bad, and the action is weak and sparse.
This movie was so immensely praised by critics and hyped about everywhere, but the product that came out in the end is trash.
I was initially really looking forward to this movie since Black Panther looked awesome in Civil War but now he's just a boring character that makes me sigh whenever he appears in other Marvel films.
This movie is just such a let down after seeing all the previous instalments.
0/10 will never watch again."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,4/10,"Honestly, just a terrible movie. Overly generic plot and terrible acting. This is a landmark failure for MCU. Michael B Jordan doesn't have what it takes to be a villain at all. The movie makes use of what is basically BLM propaganda as the villain's agenda and I feel this has been done to try and evade harsh critical reviews, what a shame! Andy Serkis was just too brilliant, sadly the movie doesn't revolve around him. Countless cringe worthy moments as a result of poor dialogue writing. The romantic sub plot just doesn't work. Winston Duke (M'Baku) has a few memorable moments but the movie on the whole is entirely a forgettable experience. 4 stars only for visual effects and a select few actors who performed well."
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2020,,"Michael B Jordan is the Manakin Skywalker of this generation! He doesn't express himself, he just says his lines. So flat. Become the character!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Black panther was EXCELLENT and AMAZING, a movie that has somehow managed to capture and display so many of the rarely touched on thoughts, ideas, desires and needs of all people, from ancient times to our present, especially those of us who are of color. This movie portrays and expresses some things that are very rarely seen or heard of in any movies that we presently see on tv or in theaters. Black men in power successfully leading others, respected intelligent and creative Black women, Black people working together to achieve things, sharing technology, key phrases that are prophetic to those who understand the changes that are occurring right now in our world. This movie itself is a multi-layered anomaly that terrifies some who understand the power of movies and music to influence real world societies. YES, it is exceptionally entertaining and definitely stirs the pots of racial biases, cracking and reforming the molds of what we are used to seeing and hearing on our screens. This movie is blazing a whole new path to the future and opening minds of the money makers to new ideas being possible and profitable. This is why ""the haters"" are doing everything they can including falsely rating the movie poorly, to stop people from seeing this movie. THIS MOVIE IS JUST THAT GOOD. GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF, and enjoy a glimpse into the future expansion of movies and music to come. Of course Black Panther isn't to be avoided or feared... unless... you're one of the bad guys... if so... your fear will be your downfall... BLACK PANTHER IS HERE ... The concepts, the ideas and the movie. Long live Wikanda."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,4/10,"No spoilers here, but I didn¬¥t like at all, have some good action scenes with pratical effects and CGI in the half part of the movie, but is sooooo boring and have too many clich√© moments. This movie is brave in paper, but very bad executed... (sorry for my english)"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"After the spate of horrible DC movie (except for Wonder Woman) it was a pure breath of fresh air. This movie had everything. Great action sequences, beautiful scenery, great character development. It would be nice if DC could make something close to this."
BLACK PANTHER,22 July 2018,4/10,"I'm glad so many people had a good time with this movie. As with almost every Marvel movie there certainly were some killer action scenes, some laughs and some interesting characters. 
But for me nothing here felt special in any way which I had hoped for going into this. Even worse so, most of the typical Marvel-characteristics didn't work as well as in some of their previous entries, making them actually pretty decent: music, humour, CGI. 
As for the music, the original score is fine but the incorporation of the Kendrick Lamar curated soundtrack didn't work at all for me. Most of the tracks were pretty awful so they should have been left out of the movie. Martin Freeman and Letitia Wright were the only ones with comedic timing. And the CGI was laughably bad at times, especially towards the end. Wondering why Marvel didn't put as much effort as usual into this. After the glowing reviews I had hoped for a somewhat grittier, less Marvel-like, energetic movie (maybe a la Logan, but in Cooglers style?) but got yet another generic, predictable, formulaic and overlong Marvel episode."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,Great action packed film full of dialogue. Sci Fi drama.
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,2/10,"It's sad that in this day and age I have to put that i'm Black, but I thought this film is quite racist towards white people, I went to see this film twice to try and see if I'd misinterpreted it. But there's so much racism in it. My wife felt scared as a white woman because of how the film seemed to glorify the death of white people. A super hero film should not use race in its content."
BLACK PANTHER,21 June 2018,1/10,"Black Panther is the worst and most overrated superhero movie ever.The story is trash, the acting horrible.. !"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther will frighten many people. The depth and acknowledgement of native African and African-American social and cultural history will be viewed by some with fear and skepticism. As a 'conscious' middle-aged African-American male, the theme, the scope and the subject matter (father/son relationships, disconnected from lineage, home(land) and history, etc.) will immediately resonate with those of us in the 'community' who can relate to these issues. For many, these images, in this film, may seem wasteful and monotonous. But for those of us in the African-American community (especially here in the U.S.), these representations are displays of our totality as humane human beings whose emotional turmoil is finally being addressed. Having such a majestic, intellectually and visually stunning big-budget, big-screen major Hollywood movie production with an overwhelmingly dominant African-American cast - who exist in positions of power, control and authority, and not in servile or secondary roles - has the potential to skewer the perception of the uninitiated or the uninformed because Black Panther is a type of production that has never-before been seen in this way and on this scale. While there may be some who miss nuanced references common within the African-American diaspora (expressions, relationships, tone, presence) that are reflective in our interactions with each other - outside of mainstream engagement, the political pronouncements will probably engender the most backlash and confusion. From the Dora Milaje, to the descriptions of black and brown people as kings, queens, scientists, thinkers, world leaders and leaders of men and women, such representations of regal strength and character present a stark departure from that which is ubiquitous in the landscape of film, television, print, radio and mass/social media proliferation."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,10/10,"A movie that contains every elements of the technology. And, MARVEL did it again by implementing every aspects of technology that a person dreams to have in one's own city.
WAKANDA FOR EVER"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2019,4/10,"As most other reviewers have said something about the lackluster plot I wont say anything about that. But what I will say is this;The fight scenes were very disappointing. Where other marvel movies have had fast pace, action packed and well written action scenes, Black Panther did not have those at all. It almost looks like the actors and choreographers just did not have enough time to go through the fight scenes as they should've, and decided to make the moves slower and easier to perform.For me, being a person who really likes a well written action scene ( for example I love the John Wick style of action scene) this was a really big letdown."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,5/10,"Seeing all the hype surrounding the movie, and a 97% RT score, i had my hopes up for this movie. but this was such a disappointment. This movie had a really good potential but they wasted it with such a dull and generic superhero recipe. Actors delivered good performances although it wasn't enough to save the movie. I went into the cinema really hyped and at one point i honestly couldn't keep my eyes open and i am someone who doesn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. what a wasted opportunity. did marvel even try for this movie? Critics are out of their mind with this one. i don't have a clue on what aspect they are praising the movie so much. All through the movie , i really really tried to like this movie , but i couldn't. If you are not biased, i'm sure you'll share my opinion too. Please Don't mess up Infinity war, marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2019,1/10,This movie was far overhyped by everybody praising its glory. My entire family hated the movie. The plot was 2-dimensional and very easy to predict. The horribly thick accents belonged in Cool Running not a Marvel movie. Even the special effects were unspectacular. I loved the performance of the Black Panther character in Civil War. There was a depth of character in that movie that was sorely lacking in this one. So many horrible things to say... It's the only Marvel movie that I have not bought nor will I ever.
BLACK PANTHER,24 August 2019,1/10,I really can't really believe how bad a movie can be. This is good (!) example of bad directing and bad acting. Don't spend your valuable time for this.
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2018,9/10,"I have no idea why there are so many poor reviews of this film, it was exciting, entertaining and fit so well into the Marvel universe. I loved the characters and the back story of Black Panther and how he came about, everyone is being ridiculous as the production values alone deserve a 9/10."
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,2/10,"The whitest story ever told in black veneer. Basically black Thor, just replace the god factor with a god-like techno-culture. As for the actual super-heroism? a gender-switched Cat Woman. There's very strong competition between direction, story and acting on which is the absolute worst. It's a tough one but I'm going to go with script. It's up there with the worst super-hero movies in the company of Elektra and such. Don't waste your time."
BLACK PANTHER,10 August 2018,3/10,"Black Panther is one of the worst films Marvel Entertainment have ever released. This was a film made around a cool character in Captain America 3: Civil War, and it was made for two reasons: A.) To pander to SJW-BLM types, B.) To explain the country of Wakanda for Infinity War. It met aim A.) very well...didn't meet B.) very well however. To expand on why it didn't; allow me to explain. Black Panther barely explores the nation of Wakanda, it briefly mentions how the became a technological powerhouse, yet doesn't explain why the properties of vibranium were so potent and how they discovered this. Character's like Tony Stark would have studied vibranium based off of Caps. shield. This is silly, and only proceeds to establish the priorities of the writers; that being to create characters that can pander to the audience. This was effectively the first 5 minutes of the film. Just to give you perspective on how utterly incompetent it is. Later on in the film we're told about how the Black Panther gets his power. It's is granted through a special plant...a plant that only one person is allowed to use...which is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. It's stupid for two main reasons: A.) Why would you not grant all of your soldiers the special flower-power? They would effectively become an unstoppable fighting force. Wakanda Warrior (Teechalla or something like that) is useless without it; illustrating how powerful it can make a mere weakling. B.) If the answer to A.) is along the lines of ""Giving too many people the flower-power would decrease the significance of the Black Panther"" you would be correct. It is clearly done for plot reasons, as without the flower power; Wakanda Warrior would be useless. However, my question would then be; Why, if Wakandan Scientists have shown an innate ability to manipulate resources that possess unique properties, have the Wakanda scientists been unable to either: Strengthen the potency of the Flower-power, thus giving the Black Panther even greater abilities over the foot soldiers, or make a weakened version; thus also maintaining the Black Panther's superiority. Either of those make far greater sense than simply restricting it to one member of society. This incompetence then also brings into question whether or not Wakandan people are actually intelligent, or if it was just done for plot reasons...do you see my point yet? Thus far the film has explained a version of Wakanda that does not exist in Infinity War, it is a nation of Plot Armour, Lazy writing, and unintelligent scientists (or writers). This trend continues to occur with the rest of the film, failing to explain how advancements in vibranium led to shield cloaks. The film is simply ridiculous, and the only thing it did successfully was pander to it's audience. Congratulations I guess. Don't watch it, don't support it in any way; else you are simply telling the writers to make more poorly written films like this in future instalments. What a waste of my time.."
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2019,10/10,The acting and the story its super nice! I watch it over and over. I'm wondering why in the hell haters is brining it down!
BLACK PANTHER,8 April 2018,10/10,"I tell you what IMDB if you cant see the bigoted comments i will put you on blog blast. I enjoyed seeing Black characters p,ay black roles rather then some one who is white with a fake tan trying to be black or African. Wakanda for life."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"It is clearly not the best marvel movie but still a watchable one. I'll put down into small points listing the pros and cons of the film.1. Accent issues - it was quite hard to understand what the characters were saying. 
2. Acting - some characters were just funny when they said a dialogue. It could have been better for sure. Well, not as in all the characters were funny. Some of them did their part quite well. 
3. Impact - What I felt was the film did not have the right impact on the audience as they do in every marvel movie. This movie just felt unfinished. 
4. Story line - Well that is one thing I loved about the movie so much. The story was really great. It was far better than a lot of other superhero movies. If you are a marvel fan, you should watch this one to get to know Wakhanda and where the Black Panther comes from. Overall it was alright! Not a bad one. People definitely had a lot more expectations and it has just been overhyped that way. Don't listen to people who have been saying it is worst marvel movie or the best one. I would just say it was a fine movie. Not the worst but not the best too. Get some popcorn and enjoy your time without expecting too much from it."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,8/10,"For a one of a kind experience and push for 95% mostly black actors. It blew me away and it really showing the talent, drive and popularity for young and upcoming actors.The story was intriguing, but seemed to be mirroring Pochantos and The Avatar. That being said, still interesting concepts of modern day animation with a on your edge of the sear experience. Saw it twice, wouldn't mind a sequel, but that's about it. All in all a fantastic movie, orginally wasn't going to see it, yet I did with a friend and was blown away.Reviewed 4.29.18

BLACK PANTHER,22 April 2018,5/10,"Black Panther is a fairly entertaining superhero movie, but horribly lacks in many areas. It's about as good as Iron Man 3, or as good as Batman Begins to a person who doesn't really care for Batman.It seems like the writers took bits at pieces from Batman, James Bond, and Iron Man, and made an over-budget knock-off that always keeps you wondering ""now where did they steal this bit from?""It gets really cheesy at many points. All they need to do next is over-use the camera special effects and replace the actors for Indian people, and this would be a Bollywood flick. There is a scene where Black Panther is at a basketball court in the inner city. I was just praying that he wasn't going to pull a Catwoman and show off his moves to the local teens.As a big comic fan, one this that really annoyed me is how inconsistent Black Panther's powers are. In one scene, he moves at bulletspeed, has super-strength, and is as agile as perfectly programmed TASbot. And then in other scenes, he's a total noob."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,1/10,"Longest toy commercial I've ever seen.Started off okay, got worse throughout and was complete nonsense by the last thirty minutes."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Was so refreshing and beautiful to see black men and women in positions of power fighting for what they believe in. Much more accurate reflection of the real world than other Marvel movies. Characters are so well-written and three-dimensional. I was on everyone's side at different points. I've never seen a superhero movie like this where the protagonist and the antagonist were both equally right and wrong. The plot and message are so powerful. Some amazing lines that I can't believe are in a Marvel movie. Cinematography is breathtaking. Wakanda is excellent both visually and thematically!! Definitely the best Marvel movie, one of the best movies I've ever seen period."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,4/10,"It could be a good movie if the producers were more focused on the storyline than just sharing their political opinions on it.
I think he's a great character but I didn't feel the real action or a real problem as a ""superhero"".
The film was just ok, but it could be a lot better.
Btw I loved the visuals :)"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,YOU LOVED TO HATE THE VILLAN AND MICHAEL B JORDAN WAS NO DIFFERENT HE WAS FINE AND AMAZING!!! EVERYONE WAS FANTASTIC
BLACK PANTHER,16 July 2018,2/10,I'm watching the movie right now AND I'm on-line. Need I say more?!?
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,3/10,"Great film if you forget the first hour or so which without question everyone in our group said was like watching an old Tarzan film. No action, poor dialog and not very good acting. The film picked up for the last hour but by then quite a few families were long gone. If you watched the adverts for the film then you had seen the best bits."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,10/10,"Good hero story, cast, performance,... not too much political issues, but with a good message about doing what is right... what is difficult to see in other movies (filled with egocentric messages)...."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,5/10,"BP is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in some time. After stealing the show in Civil War I was hyped for T'Challa's standalone feature. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. The plotting was sloppy, the action scenes uninspired, the CGI frequently dodgy, the humor forced and unfunny (like the M'baka's vegetarian line - dead silence) It felt epic and small at the same time. I wanted to know more about Wakanda, but it was nothing more than window dressing. I wanted some details of their daily lives, but all we see are people milling about in some kind of market place and every African trope you can think of. If a white guy directed this, they'd be calling for his head. It seems as though the only things Cooglar knows about Africa are what he's seen in the Lion King and Coming to America. Even though they're supposed to be super advanced, they have spears and armoured Rhinos! Really? And they determine rule by combat. Seems like intelligence would be more important than physical strength in such a society. There's a guy with the disc in his lip, women with rings on their neck, stuff straight out of National Geographic. If they are a secret society, why even bother with typical African tropes, it could have been anything. 
What I found the most off putting was just how lazy the script was. Many of the subplots were pointless, like the trip to Busan. During the car chase, the women are driving a car made of Vibranium. Bullets do nothing, but Klaw's hand weapon blows it to bits, even though he said vibranium makes his claw look like a pea shooter or something. T'challa drinks some kind of natural steroid during the combat to determine king, but both times he gets his ass kicked. What? The romantic subplot was tacked on and pointless. Vibranium can apparently enable one to do anything. It's supposed to be the strongest metal that can absorb impact but it can also cure wounds, be turned into thread, affect flora, turn tribespeople into experts in all technology, etc.
The plot was just so ridiculously stupid. The bad guy wants to send like five little spaceship things to give vibranium melee weapons to ""war dogs"" all over the world to enslave everyone. I'm not even going to touch on the insane racism of this since it was the villains plan, but how is that even a threat? It would only result in a few terrorist incidents and an eventual war for Wakanda. So dumb. 
Another problem was that we just had Spiderman that featured Ironman, Thor that featured Hulk, and this got...Martin Freeman? Sure they introduced a lot of characters but they were all African Stereotypes and one Mary Sue (Shuri). None of them were very relatable. 
The only thing the movie had going for it was the acting. They did the best with what they were given. Even T'challa was pretty dull. He was the boring boy scout people give Superman shit for. He had way more presence in Civil War, he was a slightly arrogant bad-ass in that. It gave him an edge. Here he's a vanilla boyscout that sometimes ""freezes"" and gets his ass kicked. 
For the record I consider Ironman, Avengers, Winter Soldier, and Ragnorok as best Marvel and Ant-Man, Age of Ultron, Thor 2, Ironman 3 and sadly Black Panther as worst. People shouldn't be celebrating that it merely exists, they should be mad they were given such a lazy, mediocre product. I am."
BLACK PANTHER,11 August 2018,1/10,Turned it off after 15 minutes. The dialogue and green screen action shots were atrocious. Seriously some...hell any practical effects would be cheaper for the filmmakers and have more visual impact. All of this would be for nothing though without a story. And that is what Black Panther lacks the most. It was just stupid.
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,10/10,"This review is purely for Chadwicks performance, it really made me feel a type of way at the time of watching. RIP"
BLACK PANTHER,28 September 2018,1/10,I don't understand how ppl can even watch this. I have netflix and literally put this movie on to help me fall asleep... swear to god .... btw I like Chadwick if fast and furious Tokyo Drift and that terrible green lantern movie had a child this movie is it
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,4/10,"I just don't know many times they said the word ""vibranium"" in the movie. The movie should have been named as ""vibranium"". You feel hear that word more than hundred times in the movie. The movie was despite many lapses were OK. They could have made better origin story, as I didn't see anything of genius level. Everything was as expected. Andy Serkis as Klaw in the movie was looking brilliant and flawless. Though his role was small and he made his mark. The antagonist in the movie also acted well and he was looking menacing. Main hero was also good, and he did his part well. Dialogues were fine but more was expected as you don't expect humour to come out. I just can't believe what the critics loved so much about the movie. Every marvel movie besides last Thor feels like same. I just can't believe how many times they are saving the world or galaxy. These superheroes movies are feeling quite redundant now."
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,9/10,"The one of the best movies of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The characters are good, music and sounds are just amazing."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,4/10,"So poorly done. The effects are awful. The way it is filmed is awful, cartoonish. Really disappointed. Clearly the same effort/money was not put into this"
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,2/10,"People made this film up to be the best marvel film of all time, some of the cgi in this film was ATROCIOUS, sound track was mixed and horrible, and the concept of the film was over all stupid.""so like we have this resource called vibranium, it never runs out and it fuels our entire society""it wasn't worth going to the theater to see african tribal people spear fighting over popcorn. The only reason it has 2 stars is because it had a connection to the rest of the marvel universe which is well established, and filmography wasn't bad. but of course filmography is good, its a MARVEL movie"
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther has everything you want in a great action film and beyond that, it provides social parallels to issues Black people deal with on a daily basis. If you think this is a bad film and you cannot appreciate to artistry of Ryan, Chadwick, Michael, Lupita, Forrest, and so many more, then maybe movies just aren't your thing. Black Panther is definitely top 3 in the current MCU. Take negative reviews with a grain of salt seeing as some people have a tough time enjoying motion pictures that only have 2 white people in them."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"I have seen a lot of reviews on here about how the plot is lackluster and the acting is bad. I do not think that either of these things is true.While I do see how some would see the plot, specifically Erik Killmonger's motives, as being heavy-handed; I think the statement about colonialism is powerful. Killmonger's suggestions, up until his final verdict about how to deal with his anti-colonialism, are all very valid even if they are shrouded in anger. He has a right to be angry, and as an audience you realize this.T'Challa on the other hand is affected deeply by Killmonger's words and actions, and while he does not see his violent resolve as a helpful means of reparations, he still empathizes. By the end of the movie I feel as if T'Challa is different morally and changed very dramatically in a plethora of ways. To go further, the entirety of Wakanda is changed forever. They open themselves to the world in an attempt to help others who are underprivileged or disadvantaged. All of the characters, lead or otherwise, change throughout the movie. It is refreshing to actively see change based on experience, especially in a solo MCU movie. And, it adds a new perspective to T'Challa specifically.Basically, Black Panther was entertaining, the fight scenes were good, character development was good too. That being said, some CGI felt unfinished and some writing not edited well enough. This movie is not perfect, and it had its thematic and cinematic (visual) faults, but it was refreshing to see such great representation without it feeling forced or butchered. Worth the watch."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,1/10,Boring movie filled with political pandering. The only bright spot of this terrible movie was Andy Serkis and he didn't have near enough screen time. This would be a good movie to watch if you are having trouble falling asleep.
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2018,10/10,Just amazing. I loved this movie so much. Especially the world building of Wakanda!!Great villains and overall just fantastic characters and mythos. Black panther is definitely the king of Marvel
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,5/10,"Sometimes felt like a Star Wars movie? But it's on earth. Very advanced technology. But it does show traditional African tribes and features that are realistic. 
In terms of marvel movies, not all of them are great hits, and personally I didn't think it was amazing. There was a battle sequence that was quite good. I liked some of the characters, like T'Challa, but he does seem very stoic, as other people have been saying, lacking in emotional expression a bit. I liked Danai's character."
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,7/10,"Honestly, a huge disappointment. All this hype surrounding the movie and what I came to see was utterly cheesy and cringe-worthy dialogues, build-up of the villain in an amazing way only to be let down afterwards by stupid script and silly dialogues. Failed attempt of making puns, and even moments of seriousness and the emotional scenes involved such stupid dialogues that the audience in the theater laughed at it instead.
You can either make Superhero movies which really touch you emotionally and focus on making a good film, that'll last with the viewers for years, be it The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Logan. Or you can make movies that involve great action and on point puns, that'll be forgotten soon, but those movies are good nonetheless, like Deadpool, Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies will be forgotten fast, but definitely run in the cinemas longer than any other ones. Combining the two is a difficult task, making a movie that satisfies the needs of an audience that critically watches movies and actually considers the actors real, for those two hours, and don't just go to the cinema to stuff their faces with popcorn while watching a fight between the cliched protagonist and the antagonist, be it as unreal as it may.They've tried to combine those two categories of film making and have failed miserably. I don't care whether it grossed out at 1.3billion or whatever. The point is remains that it's a bad movie. An unfinished movie. Immature acting, Cringe worthy dialogues and bad directing.
 *DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.*"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,6/10,"Ryan Coogler, relative new comer, and director of 2015's Creed, does an incredible job of realising this complex character first introduced in the third Captain America movie, Civil War, Black Panther was an integral part of the storyline and captured audience's attention with a flair for spectacular action stunts. Black panther stands triumphantly as it's own story, understood to be taking place in the grander scheme, but telling a story firmly rooted in it's own world, and not leaning too hard into being an infinity War lead-up. Compared to plethora of MCU films, and even to the current deluge of films in the super-hero genre, with releases this year from Fox, Sony, and others, Black Panther is a fun solid start to 2018's year of the superhero.The film has spectacular action sequences, a beautifully moving and creative score, design work evoking African culture while melding with fictional advanced technology. However, the film is not without its faults. The plot is predictable when it's not all over the place. The script fails to endear us to characters in the way the score is begging us to feel. Many characters' motivations are constantly undefined. And the 3D conversion is nauseating (and that's coming from someone who ALWAYS chooses the watch a movie in 3D if available).There is a moment in the Avengers where Thor says of Thanos' intentions that his interest in Earth stems from the fact that Earth has demonstrated they are ready for a higher form of war, and Black Panther asks the audience to accept a higher form of superhero film, and while I applauded it for its attempt, and for the moments where it succeeds, that just makes the moments where it falters all the more disappointing and unforgivable.You can't ask an audience to come along on a more intellectual movie and then hand them a B grade superhero flick. I don't fault critics for being so overwhelmingly positive about this movie, it's a good movie with a positive message, and I'm rating it positively too, it's just not the movie we needed, it's not the Messiah that it's being hailed as.Wonder woman needed to be good so that we can get other female led superhero films. Black panther needed to be good because we need better minority representation in films, in genre films specifically. Not just in characters, but in story. And in that regard, it will undoubtedly succeed in making sure studio executives believe investing in movies like Black Panther is a good idea and will bring audiences to the theatres in droves. In that way the movie has most definitely succeed."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,1/10,"This is the most horrible movie I have seen in decades. Trash... The accents, the story line, some of the effects, The Third Finger given by a culture that would not have used the gesture... just plain awful. And they wonder why people pirate movies... so they don't have to pay $10.00 plus another $10.00 for snacks to sit through crap like this!"
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2019,8/10,"This movie does an incredible thing, in that it takes a fusion of African, European, and American cultures and does so in an exquisite way. With a strong yet predictable plot, good acting, and thunderous action this movie checks all of the boxes that you want from an action movie and adds a few extra on top."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,1/10,Think the director is a relative of the producers or the producers just wanted to waste their money with a novice director. Short film makers do a better job. Wasted 2 hours of my life watching this piece of junk.
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,9/10,"Let me just start by saying that I'm usually too lazy to write reviews for a good movie. I usually only would go to the trouble of writing a review when I think something is bad and I want to vent. I think there are many people who are like me so perhaps that's the reason why I'm seeing so many poor reviews here. I'm writing this now because I feel like I just have to put this thought out there because there is user behavior bias to the review system, and people should be aware. I scrolled through some of the poor reviews and found that many of them think the movie is too flat or that the actors are not good. I mean, this is a Marvel movie, so don't go expecting the Titanic. If you like this line of story, you'll like it, if not, then don't watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Visually beautiful, emotionally beautiful, great concept and dialogue. Now the costumes, narrative and acting omg! Deserves an award doesn't matter what your skin colour is, this is a must watch for all. Don't mind the critique they had to dig very hard to find something bad about this film, anything can be critiqued nowadays even if something so good like this, because we all have feelings and opinions that get in the way of being honest & appreciative, but even still this is a must watch thanks, Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,Doesn't matter. Really enjoyed the movie with my beloved family. Thank you.
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,10/10,Wow don't under stand why everyone e didn't give this a 10!!! It's an amazing story with awesome writers and awesome actors! this was put so well we saw it twice never gets old... i think some white people need to get off there high horse or something
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"What you get from this movie is part action, part soap opera (with humor) and a great filler leading up to Avengers: Infinity War... Believe it or not, this movie is just as good as Winter Soldier and Civil War... Regardless of the film's shortcomings, it's still enjoyable and worthwhile to watch. The movie did a good job paying homage to African diaspora culture & spirituality... It also turns the focus on Afro-futurism... Yes, the movie does make social critiques, which is what good movies, as a form of art does-share reflections on how far we've come as a society and how much more work needs to get done...The movie is in no way racist... It's actually a good strategic move for Marvel opening up the MCU to diverse worlds and characters... The acting is very good with Michael B. Jordan playing a menacing anti-hero... I know a lot of folks are surprised to see a predominantly black cast bring forth such strong performances but get over and use this movie as a springboard to learn more about other cultures besides the Eurocentric dominated media...The Black Panther soundtrack is on fireeeeeeeeeeeee... Yup."

BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,10/10,"This is a movie that brims with rich culture, spectacular story, drama and action. I really loved every second of it. The villain is probably the most well characterised character ever put on a Marvel film. King T'Challa's quest to find out the truth of being a king is a very beautiful portrayal of the hardships of being a leader and the legacy that you carry with you. The feminism is on point here. Seldom do we see many women involved in an action scene in many dumb movies. This is not the case here. You get to see Okoye take down a car with a spear in an awesome manner, and so much more... even women soldiers fight in the end with the tribes. This movie is populated with feminism, racial equality and most importantly, a story that brims with heart and moral choices that decide one's fate. This is a super-hero movie that you've never seen. Sets a new standard for super-hero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,25 September 2018,3/10,"This movie was built up to be the best of the year in Marvel series. Far from it. Was disappointed in the acting and the predictability. I like Black Panther the character, but not in this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,,"Kiddie Mickey Mouse Disney has ruined the original good stories from Marvel Comics that DESERVE TO BE ADAPTED INTO MOVIES MORE CORRECTLY.This kiddie disney style humor mixing with sophisticated Marvel Comic stories is the worst thing DIsney can put a Marvel Comic Book fan through. I'm not talking about the newbie Marvel fans that don't read comic books. Older fans paid there dues buy purchasing comic books and actually reading them. All we get from Disney are kiddie mickey mouse Marvel movies for the kiddies.DISNEY AND MARVEL DON""T MIX! 1/10 starts BOO! DISNEY BOOOOO!Not watching or reading anymore Mickey Mouse Marvel movies or new comic books. Going back to DC Comic Book reads."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,3/10,"After all the hype Black Panther got, I was expecting a more interesting storyline, but I found the storyline to be very generic. On the brighat side, the movie did try to convey deeper messages in a creative manner. For example, at the start of the movie, they clearly addressed the history of slavery and the civil rights movement in the US. They also portrayed strong female characters, which I think was great. On the other hand, the jokes they had in the movie felt so out of place and they were too cringey. I feel like the jokes might have been more acceptable if the movie was comedy, or if the storyline and characters weren't too serious. The jokes just felt out of context and irrelavent.I feel like if the movie was from the villain's perspective, it would be more interesting because then you would see how he discovered more about his father and how he came about to be this ""villain"". I honestly believe that his perspective wouldn't be boring like the king's perspective. I also hated how they made one of the kidnappers say ""wallahi I will kill you"" as this portrays Muslims negatively like most media sources nowadays. I found it extremely repulsive and so offensive to many people.I could go on about what I didn't like, but there are too many things."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Trust me when I saw a must see, this is a must see and I don't do reviews."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Pros: Chadwick Boseman, Micheal B Jordan, BGM, Story, Action Sequences
Cons: A bit political and a bit draggy
Overview its a pow pow for your money!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,6/10,"In a movie market where superheroes are dominating the scene, it is of little surprise that Disney's Marvel keeps producing new backstories to beloved superheroes. As someone that frequently continues to see the movies while they are still on the big screen, I am a fan of new heroes getting their share at they're own background story in order to further develop the Marvel franchise as a whole. I tend to enjoy single hero movies a bit more than the collaborations, as they tend to have more depth than the action packed, multi superhero movies; I am actually a huge fan of Captain America: The First Avenger. That being said, I was not the biggest fan of this movie. It had some jaw dropping visuals and some interesting sci fi tech that will hopefully be utilized heavily in Infinity War, but it did not have much beyond that. The overarching story line is not terrible, but it isn't great. The what was thought to be the main villain is killed about half way through and has very little depth. The man that kills him happens to be a kid that witnessed the aftermath of the King killing his brother and spent his whole life seeking revenge. Cliche much? One of the best parts of superhero stories is that their counterpart villain is just as interesting as the hero itself, the main villain in this story was relatively boring and came as a ""shock"" that was not really much of a shock. Most of this stories ""twists"" were easily predictable and hit on a ton of cliches. While this makes for a shallow, relatively boring story, it does not make for a bad movie in whole. Overall, it was simply average. It is not the worst Marvel movie I have seen, but it is certainly not the best. Hopefully Infinity War is leaps and bounds greater than this. Would recommend seeing after it comes out of theaters, probably will add it to my collection. Average."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,10/10,"This movie is a truly beautiful and inspiring piece of work. I myself am a black female who found this movie unbelievably enjoyable and fun, but for some reason many people write hate reviews although it's something that is fun and a piece of inspiration. This movie has caused a lot of talk and hype making it hard to know what to expect when you go watch for the first time, all I can say is make sure you sit there with an open mind. No need to worry about what I write or anyone else does, just go in excited for another great marvel success."
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2018,10/10,"A lot of people here complaining about poor characters and plot, but this is by far the deepest Marvel movie to date. It seems like they couldn't get past the cast being mostly black and the movie being largely set in Africa.For once, the big bad in this movie has a point. He's not just evil for some silly reason, and in the end he isn't simply defeated. This complexity is something most superhero movies lack, and some excellent acting all round really makes this a fun and thought provoking movie.The visuals are excellent. Marvel seems to have listened to complaints about other movies looking a little flat and dull and really fixed those problems here.Black Panther is the stand out movie in the Marvel cinematic universe. Just when it felt like it was getting tired and running out of ideas, Black Panther proved there was still a lot left to see."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,1/10,"Interesting movie but as the film is being ""bragged"" by the critical quotatist, the film should be punished by the public not to use these issues to be relevant."
BLACK PANTHER,1 January 2019,6/10,"Well, I am not big fan of the super-hero movies like my siblings. When we were watching this movie, i thought to sleep.Acording to my siblings, they were dissapointed and i think like that, so this movie should be really awfull."
BLACK PANTHER,8 October 2018,3/10,"I thought the characters ruined the movie. Their dumb grunting and mean mugging, acting like they were all hard and superior just made me cringe. I found it watchable, but I wouldnt say entertaining, cause I couldnt stand the ridiculous acting. Besides Chadwick. He's the only one I liked."
BLACK PANTHER,22 April 2018,1/10,"Besides having only the faintest vestiges of a plot, which are about as subtle as a Mickey Mouse comic, the acting, if it can be called that, is wooden and utterly unconvincing. While the CGI images of scenery and city are quite magnificent, the action shots are so confusing, blurred and rushed through that they make no sense most of the time. This film is really recommended for five year olds with ADHD."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,Black Panther is absolutely a must see movie. It's worth seeing repeatedly
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,5/10,"In my opinion the story line is a lil bit messed up. about wrong or right. just like civil war. the cinematography could be better. they try to make it look fabulous by moving the camera a lot just like those fight scene in kingsman but end up showing less details. but it just the camera work, the graphic, scenery is amazing."
BLACK PANTHER,27 December 2019,4/10,"Very nice effects and clothes but it is too slow. The plot is predictable, I was expecting to be more entertaining and less boring."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"I have enjoyed previous Marvel movies but this is a total waste of time, bad acting, terrible dialogue, why does Forest Whittaker have this awful South African accent? Some reviewers say over hyped all I can say is someone has paid a lot of people to give rave reviews. We walked out after 30 minutes and should have left whilst titles were running. Save your money."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"Not so good as a drama thriller. Seemed to push that Walls, no immigration, lack of diversity is good thing. then push itself as a agent of change."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,3/10,"Okay, okay. Don't flame me. I love Black Panther when he first appeared, I love him in Civil War. But in this movie, I don't like his character at all. I could understand him when he's brooding and quiet after his father's death, he's grieving and sad - now that he's crowned and all - he's not? Feels like a flaw in the character here.The script is poor. At some point, I'm a little bit annoyed at the vine jokes they put in the movie, but that's not the point. It's more like... The villain is not so villainous after all. He just wants revenge, a typical background for a villain. How great.What I think is nice is Klaue. He's unpredictable, he's a little off here and there. But he could be a better villain than Killmonger, to be honest.The good point of the movie is, well, because Marvel is pretty good with designs and graphics. I like the cultural aspects they put in architecture, and the mixture of slight cyberpunk and traditions. It's beautiful.I don't have comments for cast, because well, they're pretty much good actors. I'd praise Michael B Jordan if he could be given a better Killmonger, but aaaa too bad - they cut him off too."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"BLACK PANTHER is the best SOLO movie in MARVEL!, KILLMONGER is One of the best villians of MARVEL! This movie has drama, sad moments, AMAZING moments, intense moments, GREAT VISUAL EFFECTS!. the CAST is AMAZING! ALL OF THEM! SHURI, NAKIA AND OKOYE, THEY'RE BADASS!! 1 HOUR OF THE MOVIE. IS GOOD , LITTLE BORING, BUT AFTER OF THE 1 HOUR ALL IS FUNNY, AND MOSTLY IMPORTANT, AMAZING!WAKANDA IS AMAZING!, WAKANDAS DESIGN IS INCREDIBLE!

BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"If anyone on here says that the movie is too politicized, then they are lying and have not watched the movie. Too many people are on here just to give the movie a bad rating because of the name of the film, the fact that is stars a predominant black cast and because they are extremely insecure. There are virtually no politics in the film, and it's just a very well acted, very well directed and awesome superhero film. You have two Academy award winners in this film, four of the actors have been nominated for an Oscar and two of them have an MFA from Yale. They are an insanely gifted cast and brilliant actors, and they did not disappoint here. It has beautiful scenery, a great storyline and high octane action sequences. A+"
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2019,4/10,"I didnt think there could be a worse movie than this, but then I watched Aquaman and....yea, here we are"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2019,2/10,"Tony Stalk once told Capt America ""everything special about you came from a bottle"". As Tony learned there was a lot more to Captain than that. Now if Stark would have told BP ""everything special about you came from a glowing turnip"", I think that is an insult he could have gotten away with. The BP character was likeable, but there was nothing in the plot that made me really care about him. The obvious goal was to make BP into a character of Tony Stark level importance. Instead the film only hit Hawkeye level of importance. Aside from lacking character development, the plot just seemed slow and predictable. BP is easily my least favorite Marvel movie.
A reason to see this movie? Just to better understand how BP and Wakanda fit into the Marvel movie universe. Ultimately, BP was a missed opportunity.
Another thing I learned - Michael B Jordan is a jinx to superhero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,8/10,"A fast-paced, terrific watch featuring many well-renowned and budding actors alike. While it might not have been the first black superhero film as many had pointed out, ""Black Panther"" brings Sub-Saharan-African culture into the spotlight by combining many elements of pan-African tradition (such as speaking Xhosa and English interchangeably) with American-style superhero story."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,8/10,"First would like to note that I rarely leave reviews, but seriously felt that I had to with this one.First off I went into the cinema only a week late from my original planned date to watch what was undoubtedly (personally) my most anticipated flick of 2018; within which time I had heard a lot of different and also divided reviews from separate people. I had eventually settled on the suggestion that you'll enjoy the movie more, or less, depending on how much the character of 'Black Panther' and setting in the fascinating fictional city of 'Wakanda' appeal to you prior to your first viewing of the movie. I was comfortable with this as, being a massive fan of Marvel comics, I reassured the certainty that T'Challa is my favourite superhero of all time. Because of this it is easy to say that I may very well be biased to the character, however I entered my screening of Black Panther with fairly mediocre expectations of the movie after what I had heard, and it is safe to say that I was absolutely mind blown.The score, to begin with, is very fitting to the setting which really immerses you into the story. It had an African theme to it, which suits the movie being set near to Kenya and Ethiopia, accompanied by a classic MCU soundtrack to satisfy the whole sci-fi and comic-book action side of it. Unfortunately Toto's ""Africa"" was not featured, however I did love the end credits tune 'All The Stars' by Kendrick Lamar and SZA which easily connected to the whole Oakland setting and perspective of Erik Killmonger (who is safely now my favourite MCU villain). Killmonger totally kicked ass and stole the show for me, and I adored the tie-in with him being the cousin of T'Challa (Black Panther) himself.The CGI and special effects were fantastic and clearly had a lot of effort put into them, akin with the stunts performed throughout the movie; all of which packed a punch with certain scenes that seriously took my breath away. Shuri is such a sweetheart and is easily my favourite character, having some of the funniest scenes in the entire flick and the storyline really is fantastic and very true to the Black Panther comics.Moreover, the ending of the movie genuinely brought a tear to my eye; something which not many TV Shows or movies have done before. I realized upon Black Panther's sacrifice of his own cousin, Erik Killmonger, he was reflecting upon his fathers advice that ""it is hard for a good man to be king"". This tied in beautifully with the way T'Chaka killed Erik's father in the prologue; but I also loved T'Challa's sense of forgiveness towards Erik upon taking him to witness the sunsets of Wakanda, in order to fulfill his dream created by his father, as the last image he saw before he died. In that scene where T'Challa and Erik sit together and watch the sunset, it was easy to identify the sense of family between them, which I like to think they felt themselves, as cousins, too.I am easily going to give Black Panther a 9/10, making it my highest ranked Marvel movie ever. You should definitely spend some money on watching this movie, especially if you are a fan of the Marvel universe, and more in particular, Black Panther as a character."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is amazing and extremely entertaining. I have NO agenda, political or otherwise. I am an avid movie goer, 10 to 15 times a month, and I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Can't wait to see again. Politics never crossed my mind. Actually, if you think this movie is below standard, most likely THOSE comments are politically-inspired. Again, extremely good cinema!! Thank you Marvel!"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"What a movie. Going into the movie, my expectations were really high, and surprisingly, I cam out with not only reaching my expectations, but surpassing them. I went with my friends and after the movie I couldn't stop talking about, for one, how great the movie was, and how cool Michael B. Jordan's character was, Erik Killmonger. Just everything about his character gave me goosebumps-every time i saw him on the screen. Unfortunately, I was not able to watch the movie in IMax, but after watching it one time in standard, I would very much want to experience the ""IMax experience"" for this movie. If you are debating on watching this, you very much should watch this movie and mark my words when I say you will love it!"
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,10/10,"The last time a movie surprised and impressed me this much was The Matrix. The opening scene of Trinity's escape was everything! I've probably seen 350+ movies since then, including the latest Star Wars, just about everything the Wachowskis have done and some brilliant martial arts movies out of Hong Kong. Many of those movies have been great and I'd rate a few of them a 10 (Inception and Get Out come to mind), but, Black Panther was a real surprise. With a mostly black cast, and with all the historical significance of that, and with it being a Marvel outing, I was excited and hoped it would be good; but I wasn't expecting great. Black Panther is stylish and witty. The action scenes aren't gratuitous, pointless and just testosterone-fueled. Women kick ass and help to drive the story/action. It wasn't just T'Challa's story. The villain, women of Wakanda and others got their moments to shine. Probably the brightest star of the movie though is Ryan Coogler. He's now in the league of directors like Christopher Nolan who I'll always pay money to see their work. Coogler clearly has a unique voice and vision and he's impressed the heck out of me.There were one or two things I didn't love (Andy Serkis didn't have enough scenes, for example) but those things don't distract too much from the movie. I've seen it twice and already and I'm sure, like The Matrix, I'm going to see it a few more times before it even comes out on blu-ray/dvd."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,2/10,"This movie was awful. Disgustingly bad in so many ways that I can't explain them all. Generic story-line, very confusing scenes, showing new developments every 5 seconds, trying to keep the watcher entertained. To me it felt like the really bad try of Marvel to counter whitewashing in movies, say ""blackwashing"". I was insulted by how ridiculously it is done, mixing tribal style with african american elements. All actors could have been white anyways as it seemed so unreal, but then again, all the barbarism wouldn't quite fit. In my eyes an abominable illustration of black culture and a down to the core white and terrible movie. 1 star for the neat visuals though."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"Okay to start things of.. pardon my grammar, i'm just a foreign dude who love movies and a big fan of marvel movies.. that's it.
im just here to swing by cause i got a lot of complaint with the movie and why i give it 7/10..
i admit that this movie is a good addition action flick to another marvel films that ever created until now, but i'm just expecting something more as a marvel fan, cause of the trailer that they always drop before the movie.
There are some weaknesses, such as a rather slow start, and some battle scenes that are somewhat forced timings .
there is a scene where t'challa is inaugurated as king and a black panther that should have an extraordinary scene but it looks rather dull and boring like nothing just happened.
nevertheless, the movie has some great moments and cool scenes even if it does not make an impression on my memory.
by the way, andy serkis gives a great performance here, he deserves more attention and I respect himIn conclusion, if you're a marvel lover, you might like this because infinity war is coming and everyone is waiting for it, and this movie is just a great addition to the other marvel action flick.
but if you're not a marvel fan, this movie has some decent action but not perfect.."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,2/10,"There is a 16 year old girl who literally has an IQ of every other character combined! 
Why is Black Panther the hero? Why does Iron Man lead the Avengers? You could just recruit this chick to fix every single problem on Earth! She's smart, probably has an IQ around 1000 (not even exaggerating, the stuff she builds is just insane), she is an elite warrior who fights better than Wakanda's soldiers and elite Royal guards, she knows how to fix everything, she is smarter than characters who have spent their entire lives dedicated to science, she can drive better than a Formula 1 racer, yeah and she invented 90% of the stuff in Wakanda at just the age of 16 (I wonder how that works? Wakanda is supposedly thousands of years old after all.) Oh and she is arrogant and has a terrible sense of humor. Just one of the many issues in this movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,1/10,A masterpiece of cringe. IMDB users have rated this an 8? WTF?
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Such a great movie--the characters are so wonderfully realized, and there are fantastic role models all around."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,10/10,Go see the movie and judge for yourself. I saw it twice. It's another great addition to the MCU.
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,7/10,Good but in a league below the cream of the MCU films.
BLACK PANTHER,13 June 2018,1/10,"This has to be one of the most boring, bland, utterly exhausting films I have ever watched, and I have watched some rubbish.
 
The only interesting thing about this movie is the high scores and good reviews its getting. I can only assume that the fear of being called raciest out ways the duty to review truthfully. which in itself is raciest.My flatmates didn't want to criticize this move, so when I asked them they dodged the question and said ""well the special effects are good"". The Matrix had good special effects. Inception had good special effects. The special effects are as boring as the rest of this really rubbish film."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,,"Topics discussed: 
1 - Topic: Boko Haram - Criminal organization in Nigeria. In the movie truck drivers in Nigeria taking women as hostages at the beginning of the movie.
3 - Topic: Tourism in Africa. The nature scenes throughout the movie.
4 - The contrast of Wakamba, as a powerful African nation, and the reality of the underdeveloped African nation. This contrast creates an awareness of the harsh reality of Africa.
5 - The less fortunate countries, in this case countries in Africa, do have people with skills, resources and voice to contribute to the world, if us - the more fortunate people - help them. I got this issue from my reflection on the U.N conference scene at the end."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,10/10,"One of best story lines of a marvel movie, fight at the end could of been better but all around great movie"
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,5/10,"Killmonger's political idea is very na√Øve and T'Challa doesn't know how to refute that. Wakanda just signed SOKOVIA ACCORD weeks ago to restrict Avengers from ignoring other countries' border and flipping their wills fighting around. The old king T'Chaka even said: ""Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."" BUT, when it comes to Black Panther, he just invaded Korean territorial air space, ignored international law, local law and collateral damage. Wow, I mean, Wakanda is more America even than America.As a country with that kind of top notch high tech and special computer technology, their streets still look like Mumbai in India, or Sakaar planet in Thor 3. Most of people walk on the dusty soil road with bare feet.If a country is really that advanced, it should be shown in every aspects, including common people's life.Also, the political system in Wakanda is extremely fragile and dangerous. There is no proper mechanism to restrict king's power, and the selecting system is unbearably primitive. I understand it's comic setting, but MCU films always make some adaptations, why can't they make it a ritual ceremony instead? Let the elder council elect the symbolic king."
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2020,1/10,"Bunch of CGI - Check
Bad acting - Check
Boring - Check
Stupid storyline - Check
Cheesy - CheckOverrated - You have no idea...Unbelievable how this could get hyped up the way it has. I think the population is becoming dumber. Dumber and Dumber is like The Godfather compared to this pile of nonsense."
BLACK PANTHER,13 June 2019,5/10,"Cinematographie was great, Soundtrack, not that much, it doesn't deserve the oscar, the story and the plot is probably for kids not men!!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,Each character was well written and brought to life in a stunning way by the actors and actresses who played them. Plenty of action with a great story line that pulled me in from the start. It was different from previous MCU movies and that was a good thing. This is a movie worth seeing.
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,5/10,"Basic hero story, predictable twists, terrible CGI (for a 200 million dollar Marvel movie), drawled out plot, disappointment climax, mostly boring action, and small character development.However, there were some good action scenes, enjoyable side characters, and one of Marvel's best villains (which isn't saying much)."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"So, let's begin. As a black man, I'm proud to see a film that took on the challenge of a complex character, with a black director, black cast and black soundtrack production(excluding Surkis' mixtape). It was unprecedented but more importantly...... about time. Now granted at the end of the day this is a comic book movie. As a first go run for BP, i won't whine like other reviewers who claim that this was nothing major. Captain America: The First Avenger was nothing to shout about BUT it, just as BP, was a build up movie. It gave us history of a character and a country that looked something out of Star Wars. I also liked that the movie attempted to highlight social issues. Wakanda has had advanced technology for centuries but chose to do nothing about slavery, euro/asian colonization of Africa, apartheid, rape of Africa's resources...the list goes on. It just touches the surface of it and surprisingly, Killmonger and N'jobu did an amazing job bringing that to light. Also, I don't know if Coogler meant to do this on purpose but the way the world views Wakanda feels similar to what I've experienced as far as racism. Klaw views Wakandans as ""savages who don't deserve vibranum"". The asian lady in Korea who looked at Nakia the same way I'm sure Soon Ja Du looked at Latasha Harlins before murdering her in 1992 which was a precursor for the LA Riots. The way the female SHIELD agent looked at TChalla and Okoye with disgust outside of the interrogation room. Or even the UN delegate's disrespectful tone towards T'Challa by saying ""wtf assistance could your sh*thole country possibly offer the world"". These subtle tones of racism just had me going ""yep, me too"" in the theater.But even if you couldn't relate to the movie you have to admit it's still good. Not the best comic book movie ever made but definitely top 5. I've seen it twice already and might go a 3rd. Can't wait to see what they do for BP 2. They've introduced too many other interesting characters for there not to be other films. Hopefully Coogler will be directing that as well."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,10/10,Watching it sitting in the center of the theatre really brought me to Wakanda. I felt like I was part of it all. Especially in an IMAX theatre the sound was brilliant. The story wasn't as predictable as some say. The visuals were stunning. The culture was so beautifully interpreted. The fight scenes were intense. The comedy was great. I wanna see it again because I actually felt like I went there. I rate this movie realistically 9/10. If it were based on my intuition I'd say 10/10. The movie is a masterpiece.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,3/10,"I am a huge of fan of all superhero:comics movies series ,everything that has to do with marvel and DC,and 2017 was a great year for superhero movies but 2018 started with a disapointment.This is movie is just to predictable,its full of cliches , its just a ordinary movie with nothing special really.It was way overhyped and then only ""special"" thing about it was that it had a black cast.Really really disapointed"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"The start was slow and to much explanations, the action is at the end of the movie, but it's not a bad movie, just needed to see more of the black panther action."
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2018,9/10,"This is one of the best marvel movie,it's emotional,good plot am definitely happy to watch this movie again."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,8/10,"Black panther is a unique movie. It had the potential to be a hard leftist black power movie and it is refreshing and inspiring that it did not take that approach and instead gave us a story about black people becoming empowered not through violence and hatred but through peace and sharing culture. The politics are not shoved down your throat. Simply existing in the plot is not force feeding. The politics are integral to telling this story correctly in order to make black panther a great hero and role model for the black community. The performances are all great and anything but wooden. After watching tommy wiseau ""act"" one will never complain about performances ever again. Eric killmonger is a great villain and is very sympathetic and likeable and chadwick boseman plays a stoic yet noble black panther who we grow to care about through the narrative. Shuri was quite funny and reminded me of my own sister. Humor is subjective and some of the jokes definitely Wont land for everyone but that's the nature of comedy. Nothing on this planet is universally funny. I fail to understand where all the 1 star reviews come from. Is it overrated? Perhaps a little bit but this is nowhere near the level of batman and Robin or the dreaded catwoman movie. The narrative is a little bit derivative but killmonger's story makes it quite enjoyable. Is it the best marvel movie? Probably not but it's certainly far from the worst."
BLACK PANTHER,25 May 2018,8/10,Best standalone movie of MCU. Phenomenon Black Panther.
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,5/10,Too much hype. Not a Marvel -class movie. Unappealing !
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,6/10,"Black Panther presents wonderful world building and perfectly played characters and has a cultural significance that's impossible to ignore. However, the plot is wracked by common Marvel-brand movie problems and for some reason the CGI is incredibly lacking. The love interest plot could be removed to no detriment of the movie and tension is sorely lacking. There is no concern or worry regarding the characters throughout the whole story and the resolution feels basic. The characters push it along well, however, and still make eh viewing very enjoyable.The reason for a 6/10 is that I believe 5 is average, and everything above that should be earned. Black Panther's issues are the type it never had to have and were so obvious that minor adjustment could have fixed them. It seems as if the movie was rushed and a bit of the humour is painfully dated. I would still recommend this movie, particularly if you enjoy the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Such great hype,imagery and effects, loved the trailers. Pity that every action scene is in the trailer, and the rest is just lame story lines, about the prince from somewanda (Wakanda). I kept waiting for Eddie Murphy to walk out and crack jokes. It has the prince and queen and staged like Eddies film and same ""set like"" feel for the royal ascension. The constant drums in the soundtrack felt like The Lion King. 
I would have walked out, but I paid Gold Class and wanted to finish my snacks. 
Probably some great social underlying story, but when the bad guy ""wanted to see the sunset"", I struggled not to laugh out loud.
Bitterly Disapointing, worst Marvel film ever. (And I even enjoyed Wonder Woman, and Justice League)"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"I just went to this ""lesson"" today and fell asleep about 30 minutes into it. Woke up to see the token white actors in the casino scene and then had to listen to all the whining about how the whole world has kept the black people enslaved and wronged. What a waste of time. I was the one wishing I'd be thrown into the sea in chains to escape this racist drivel!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,7/10,Good start and excellent finish...slight dip in pitch during the middle
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"Great depiction of the Black African human being. 
True and Meaningful Message.
A Look and Hope for the future.
Favorite Marvel movie; (this coming from a non-marvel fan)
Good job to all cast and crew working in all departments!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Never seen such a baaaaaad movie. Wrost of all the marvel films, by far. Please do yourself a favor and throw your money in the garbage instead of spending it on this cancer."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,"Forget the hype, this is a truly awful film. Plot obvious, script desperate, acting hammy, musical score pathetic. It has no redeeming features. I was embarrased to watch it. Its bad superhero film, meets bad Bond movie, meets bad ""Out of Africa, meets bad Coming to America, meets bad disaster movie. An epic of sorts I suppose."
BLACK PANTHER,8 April 2018,10/10,I just took my younger siblings to see this movie and we all had a great time. I thought the effects were good and the acting was good as well.
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,10/10,The movie is a start of a revolution in the movies industry
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,10/10,"Great cast, new and interesting story line.
I love the way the blow my mind. However, supporting roles done better than the lead. Great sound track, Kendrick Lamar nailed again, awesome special effects. I can't not ask for more, and so excited to see them again in the next The Avengers movie."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,7/10,This actually was pretty good. I went in assuming I would think this move was just alright but really enjoyed the graphics and it has many funny moments with dry humor and I loved that!
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,5/10,"The story has so many leaks in it I don't know where to start. Like how do you hide a whole city in the 21St century? I was very impressed by the visuals which have risen to the standard imposed by the budget of the movie. The sounding wasn't that great, it seemed a bit unrealistic, even fake at certain times and out of tune with what was going on in the movie. But the story just didn't cut it for me. There was allot of action, you know the typical American production where everything blows up, cars flying up in the air and crashing with their wheels spinning. And amazing flying machines hunting eachother like in a video game. But it makes one wonder, what do wakandas really do? Or what do they do for fun? And one would expect that the advanced people of Wakanda would be sufficiently educated as not to kill eachother in a medieval style fight. So overall a decent movie, with a leaky leadership battle storyline and allot of overtones about black emancipation. Was there room for improvement, did I expect more out of it considering the hype around it? Definitely"
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,10/10,"I have never done a review before. There are tons of fake bad reviews for this movie and I don't know why. Were they just angry racists posts? The cinematography, music and acting was amazing. There were amazing fight scenes in this movie without super powers at times. The only that bothered me was Martin Freeman's American accent"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"Im a big marvel fan, have enjoyed all the film's until this one came along.Thought this was meant to be an action/ entertaining film, sat there and sat there waiting for some action, waited and waited, Nothing until the last 30 mins of any note, worst film of 2018 for me so far and i watch alot of films, wanted to walk out many times but was with my grandson, terrible acting, terrible film"
BLACK PANTHER,14 August 2018,3/10,"Both my wife and I, who have ""Wonder Woman"" as one of our favorite movies, struggled thru this mess last night. We were really going to shut it off after giving it a chance for 20 minutes. We held out hope, but it was a dud! Here's my impressions of the good and bad:
Good: The outifts were very colorful, and the African art looked nice. 
Bad: 1) an advanced society that has a monarchy, has fight-challenges, and with knives and spears? 2) how does a society become so advanced when cut-off from the world? the people there are an order-of-magnitude more intelligent than others? they sure didn't act it. 3) I understand what they were trying to do with the Africanized-English accents, but it made it hard to understand the dialogue at many points, 4) because the dialogue was not clear, the plot and subplots were lost on me. All I know is that they were all related and some relaties killed each other and there was revenge ... I really didn't feel anything for these characters, so I didn't rerun the scenes on the DVD, 5) no memorable special effects, 6) no cool, great music theme. Listen to the Wonder Woman theme music and you'll hear a great tune.
I wasted my time with this, when I could have been finishing up Season 14 of Survivor on Amazon Prime."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,6/10,"Marvel-Disney has been dominating the superhero cinematic universe for nearly 10 years and each time they release a movie, expectations are high. But, some of their movies have been overrated and BLACK PANTHER is no exception to it.It's fun and has a good change of setting(Africa) but it does not really offer much. Cgi was bad at various points,killmonger is very far from the standards of the JOKER and, despite a quite promising start , the movie falls into cliche marvel movies and gives us a sense of deja-vu culminating in a traditional marvel ending where the audience already know how it is going to end.On the overall, BLACK PANTHER is entertaining and quite fun especially with its catchy soundtrack but its highly overrated and offers nothing new to the superhero genre.Like many others i was intrigued by the passion and high anticipation surrounding this movie but in the end, i was left indifferent to it and would even say dissapointed. I'll give it 6/10 ."
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,10/10,Lives up to hype. Soundtrack was impressive and Michael Jordan's performance as Erik Killmonger stood out.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,3/10,"I was incredibly hyped for this movie and thought the movie was mostly great until they subtle racial motivations became thrown in your face by the killmonger character.The saving grace of this movie was the excellent acting by everyone involved.
They actually made strong female characters without having to make the male characters pathetic by comparison. the dormalaj (female guard) stole the show in my opinion and made wonder woman look second rate, they did so while not making the male counterparts look pathetic....take a note star wars.however the movie was nearly ruined by the racial agenda. While there was racism toward white people in pushing that white people of today are somehow evil and accounted for the deeds of their ancestors, it was far more racist toward black people.They made the black characters killmonger, his father, black panthers love interest and a few others very very racist toward black people. They kept referring to all black people as one people and brothers and sisters. That they were enslaved and oppressed. All black people are not the same, every black person is their one person and has their own beliefs and experiences. To lump all the black people of the world together simply because they have the same skin color is quite racist. Would you lump south koreans in with people of thailand? no because even though they share similarities, they are in fact very different people. Would you lump white Russians in with White americans or Austrailians? No because they are entirely different people. Skin color is the most common character distinction in people but it is also the most insignificant.Not to mention wakanda was shown to exist in the heart of africa, slaves were never or extremely rarely taken from inner countries they were mostly taken from coastal countries. further to that point, by enlarge slaves were sold to sailors by african tribes. It was common practice for warring tribes to take slaves as spoils of war and they would sell them to ships that would come by on the trade routes. Slaves were taken by force at times by colonizers but this was not needed most of the time as tribes warred and took slaves to use as commodities not only with white sailors but also with other african tribes. At least for the most part the character of black panther stays away from this and tries to distinguish that black people all over the world are not his people, his people are those of wakanda.it was just terrible writing. People go to see fantasy movies to get away from the real world and it is just terrible to see identity politics in a fantasy movie."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2018,6/10,"Black panther was a pretty good movie, cool special effects, great action,shows black representation 
though it was a bit rushed, and not enough character development for some characters like the pilot white guy( sorry can't remember his name) the background is beautiful though goes great with the music.The main villain in the movie is a decent villain and his backstory is pretty deep and sad.But the whole plot is ok not the best but still ok overall I give a 8/10 great
pros: great special effect, good action,black representation, nice villain with good backstory,shows African culture,great music with backgroundcons:too rushed,lack of character development"
BLACK PANTHER,31 July 2019,4/10,Why all the hype? And how come the score still remains above 5?
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,9/10,"It had a unique story line yo it n the accents are so real. Dope movie,kept me on toes from the beginning to the end."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,8/10,"I am not a film critic but me as a normal viewer, that this was great!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,Nice movie action was fantastic but comedy is not present in enormous amount....
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2018,2/10,"For a superhero action movie, there was very little action to be seen in this one. Rather, you can look forward to a political drama with a very awkward kiss at the end between two people who have absolutely no chemistry. Very disappointing"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Okay so I love Marvel movies and I was really excited for this one as the trailer looked awesome and because the hype seemed good.However I was sadly disappointed. I had an empty feeling when I came out of the cinema as I felt it could have been so much better. This is my unbiased opinion. I really wanted it to be good and awesome and different.There were good points. I liked Chadwick Boseman as the black Panther and there were great visuals and colours throughout the movie. However I wanted a bit more from T'Challa and the plot was pretty weak and many of the characters were under developed. I feel with many other Marvel movies they try to at least make the characters and concepts somewhat plausible but this one fell short.I mean ok I can accept that they got their power from vibranium which came from a meteor but like it didn't give any feeling of how they utilised it to the extent they had and Shuri just seemed so wooden. She looks like 16 or not much older and is supposed to be super intelligent tech woman with all this out of this world stuff, but she did not come across as a believable character in her field of expertise. She just came across like a teen who tried too hard to be funny. I mean at least with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner you get a feel for why they are so clever.Also the villain was bland and I was hoping for more street action outside Wakanda and many of the Wakanda people seemed flaky, like W'kabi. Some of the African accents were a bit off too.If you like most Marvel movies you will still probably enjoy it but don't expect it to be as good as the hype makes it out to be."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,2/10,"Just another CGI laden mess of a Chidren's Action Movie. I don't reallly care for these Superhero Movies as they depend on action CGI rather then a plot.
I did notice that other reviewers are calling this a ""cultural event""..""most significant movie ever made""...""the greatest movie ever""...REALLY?
First, this is a fantasy film. Wakanda is a fictional place...it does not exist. There were never any Space Kings or Space Queens...this is not the first Black Superhero Movie...and definitely not the best. Previous Black Superheroes..include Storm from the X-men...Blade (really good movie)..and what about Michonne from the Walking Dead? Any girl that weighs less then 100 pounds and can swing a Katana like it was a feather must have superhero powers. I would only recommend this for children and if they were bored and had nothing else to do."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,3/10,"This is a Movie you can watch when its on Tv but don't waste your Money.
Highly disappointing"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,10/10,The fact that a young black child will wake up tomorrow and wana be a super hero like Tchalla only makes me proud of the whole organization. The Best Marvel Movie I have watched my entire life.
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,"Had big expectations before entering to the cinemas but undrerstood it was all overhyped by black peoples
.Can't beleive people can be cheated like this!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2018,7/10,"Waste of time. sht jokes, sht acting, sht story, all just bullsht. only got hyped cause of all black cast.. 1 of the worst marvel movies ever."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Excellent film. Best super hero story in a long time. Marvel still needs to work on the CGI, but the layers of the film are too brilliant to worry about cosmetic indifferences."
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,9/10,"I'm a general Marvel fan, but even this blew my expectations away! I had my doubts as I saw the insanely-high Metacritic rating, but all of my fears were proven wrong when I attended a special screening of it. The action, cinematography and effects are great as usual, but it also has something many Marvel critics beg for: a right mix of humor, story, dark tone, and character. It doesn't rely on huge doses of humor as an excuse to cover it's story (like Thor Ragnarok, as much as I liked that), but instead gives each and every character a chance to grow and mature for us to care about. The story also has many interesting themes and twists, as does the social commentary about race. My only complaint was a few wonky CGI moments and an underwhelming villain, but otherwise Black Panther had enough to offer for anyone of any age to enjoy. Finally, an action movie with substance! 9.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,3/10,"This coming Oscars season, Marvel Studios so called ""critically acclaimed film"" Black Panther has been nominated for Best Picture. Sure, the film offers somewhat decent visual effects, a funky soundtrack and a stacked cast, but is it worthy of their Oscar nod?Many films over the last few decade have been snubbed of this critical award nomination, such as:
The Matrix, Cast Away, Kill Bill, The Dark Knight, Gran Torino, Foxcatcher, Gone Girl, Blade Runner 2049Each of these films encompass amazing scenes, cinematography, script, performances, and were all reviewed with critical success. Yet, none were even considered as a nomination for Best Picture, something many people still disagree with to this day, but black panther. Black Panther! Black panther gets a nomination?The Dark Knight, often regarded as the best superhero live-action film of all time, with one of the few performances where someone was awarded an Oscar for their performance as a superhero character, was not nominated for best picture. Fair enough, it is a comic book movie. But, The Dark Knight is barely even considered a superhero film, rather, a drama, revolving around concepts of good and evil, and realistic themes, such as terrorism, justice and trust. It makes you consider, what made Black Panther so great to get this nomination?Sure, Marvel has had an array of successful films, both critically and at the box office. However, is Black Panther ""the film"", that allows Marvel studios to obtain its first nomination for best picture?In my opinion, Black Panther was an overrated picture. Heavily dominated by the African-American demographic of America, it was listed as the highest domestic box office statistics of all time. This is heavily due to the culture impact it had on the African-American community, however, quality over quantity.I am not the only one who agrees that the only reason that Black Panther was nominated was due to this cultural wave. More often than not, the academy does not tend to go for big Hollywood, blockbuster films, who score big at the box office. Rather, they lean towards more independent, indie based films, which don't perform largely at the box office which don't tend to have large budgets.Black Panther is the epitome of this philosophy. It made $1.3 billion USD at the global box office. It's budget was $200 million, typical of a Hollywood action movie. It's storyline and premise was basic, and it's character development was mediocre. For me, I was slightly entertained. It was part of the marvel films universe, and it had some decent action. However, I didn't leave the cinema impressed, or leave thinking that was a different movie that I've seen, or unique in any sort. It followed the same origin movie formula, something that has been occurring a lot lately. The antagonist was not depicted any better. Again, we see a villain who has the same ability, same suit as the protagonist, just with a different colour palate!?I was shocked to see it receive this nomination this year, and even the speculations that it would win. Those who believe these rumours are consumed by the hype and the cultural trend of America. Overall, it was okay, but definitely not Oscar worthy.The story of the film is convoluted, and it lacks any pizzazz that helps to make the film unique. I quite disliked level of acting also, and the overall need to use visual effects.I am a little annoyed that a film like Black Panther gets nominated, yet ,""If beale street could talk"", doesn't get any nomination at all? It just shows how the academy can become so convinced of a film to be nominated, due to the overall outcry from a general audience.In my opinion, the critics got this one extremely wrong. It received a 97% on rotten tomatoes, another biased marvel based review! It was crazed by everyone, and that is what originally made me excited for the film. Upon my arrival however, I came to realise how wrong I was. A ""What are those"" Joke in 2018, really? The comedy was so generic and utterly butchered, that I didn't have much to enjoy in the movie except for Kendrick Lamar's soundtrack.I am disappointed that this is the film that creates ""history"" by receiving a best picture nomination, and I believe the academy gave in to the bait on this one, big time."
BLACK PANTHER,30 April 2019,5/10,"Despite my lame title, it wasn't so much the dissonance between the movie and the spectacular hype surrounding it that was most jarring to me experientially - this would come later, rather it was that so many of the narrative elements were so spiritlessly conceived, assembled and executed, that it even got in the way of the entertainment of the thing.The Vibranium powered hype is easy to understand. Marvel, a hot franchise, decides to do an all black cast Black Panther movie with a largely African setting, and banks on the novelty of the very thing for marketing vitality. The idea is rich in politics and rich in optimism - that quintessential of Hollywood opioids. The critics, already on a decades long MCU high, fall in love with the pre-sell and go in hard for their hit, and all at once what we get is a frenzied race to the bottom, critics working hard to outdo each other in elaborating and praising the addled qualities of their latest trip.But the product is vastly different from the synthesized hype. Few things work and the whole is discord at best. Despite being armed with a massive budget, the makers seem to have been overwhelmed by the central task of populating the film with believable African characters with a back stories rooted in African reality and culture. As an African myself, this was particularly devastating for me. The accents were nothing like anything I have ever encountered. They weren't Fulani, Luo or Zulu, or generic Nigerian, Kenyan or Chadian. Instead they were all over the place, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, often fused within the same character, such that they came to us robbed of all semblance of singularity, the way, say, an Irish accent in a movie identifies a character to the audience as an Irishman and all the cornucopia of meaning and sensibility that comes with that. This to me was perhaps the original sin of the entire enterprise because it's all downhill from here. The actors could not get in to their characters because they were the worst sort of amalgams with no cultural unity, which led to very weak depthless portrayals, and even far more artless dramatic interactions between the characters on screen. The affected mannerisms by the actors played out more like burlesque than anything seriously intended to communicate humanity to the audience.The direction and filmography of the movie seems to have come from a place that was either cognisant of these limitations and therefore endeavored to cover for them with various tricks of the trade, or was complicit in the negligence and it was, again, all they could do to hide this behind special effects, set design and costuming, and hope nobody watching caught the flaws.The movie just doesn't work primarily because the people behind it were either too lazy, overwhelmed, or uninterested with delving into real research on the people and cultures that they were seeking to populate their production with. Instead they seem to have just copy pasted whatever they could put together from quick scans of Google search results and hoped for the best. There are numerous examples of this from the movie, but just one will suffice to show the extent of the travesty. The Jabari tribe, a mountain dwelling, wood carving, isolationist tribe, that worships Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god!), and whose calculated role in the movie seems to be to make the political statement that not everyone is for technological advancement, yet their leader (who sometimes speaks with a generic accent, other times with an Igbo one) makes a challenge for the throne of Wakanda. How farcical is that?Perhaps someone will say that bringing an over critical eye to the movie experience is what's at fault here, that if I had just managed to get past the flaws I would have allowed myself to be entertained, but that to me is not how movies work. Films work, I contend, by directly engaging the audiences sense of empathy. They invite us to believe that the persons on the screen are real persons going through real imaginable experiences with real emotional consequences. We get to see this emotions captured on the faces of the actors, be it a smile, laughter, anger, sadness and everything between. Our minds ability to take flight, or get immersed within this simulation of life depends a great deal on its authenticity. By this I don't mean how realistic it is relative to everyday life (Audiences connect with animations and fantasy movies all the time). Rather, I mean how much our minds feel that the emotions, situations and characters portrayed mirror stimuli that is within our repertoire of familiarity. The more familiar, the more authentic and the more engaging the material is. Black Panther was simply none of this.And that is really the tragic part, because all that that hype on steroids seemed to dwell on were notions on representation, the celebration of a hitherto marginalized people, the idea that finally peoples of African descent could go to the movies and see their lives reflected on the big screen. Instead, what Black Panther proves is that, for truly authentic African stories to be told, it's not the amount of money thrown at the project and the marketing thereof that will make the difference, but the heart and commitment of the storytellers in relation to their subject matter."
BLACK PANTHER,24 March 2019,5/10,"I am sorry, but the only reason why this movie gets the praise that it does is de to the multiculturalism of the movie. The storytelling is poor at best and yes I agree the costumes are good enough for an Oscar, But it's just a intro to wakanda in the mcu. That's it."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"A rugged movie - with bold choice of role crew. Something that's actually needed, in today's worldview. The movie is great. Although something could be done better. But the best thing about the whole movie is actually all the amazing female actors: Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba, Nabiyah Be, Connie Chiume, Zola Williams etc.. We can really talk about black girl power, beauty and power hand in hand. That some things could have been done elsewhere does not really matter. But it will be a little bit of it when it comes to my overall assessment."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"As a White person I was apprehensive going into this film, as I'd heard rumors it would contain some anti-White sentiment. But I was pleasantly surprised to find the film mostly just contains positive and empowering messages of Ethnic Solidarity and National Pride for Black people.The fictional African nation of Wakanda is a racially homogeneous ethno-state, yet its people also still feel solidarity with their fellow Africans throughout the continent. A key part of the plot is the question of will the Wakandans keep their advanced technology for themselves, or will they share it will their fellow Africans, while still retaining their national sovereignty and identity. This, I believe, is a wonderful message that I as a White person could relate to. Its not anti-White, just pro-Black.Malcolm X would have loved this film."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"My Wife and I saw this movie with our boyfriend (open relationship). He's black, and said it's the best film he's seen since House Party. My Wife just loves to see him happy, and if she's happy, I'm happy.Personally, I was a bit taken aback by the ethnocentric themes of the movie. The nation of Wakanda seemed to have virtually no racial-diversity at all that I could see. Is that really such a wise thing to be encouraging these days? I'm not sure.Still, its an important moment for Black America, and Lord knows they deserve it. Mazel tov!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"I absolutely adore this movie! It brings a tear of joy to my eye to see ""ethnostates"" and ""racial homelands"" becoming a mainstream concept again. I'd love for black people to go back to Africa, their home and build great civilisations. I also want the same for my people- as a European I see this film as a unifying force between the Africans and the Europeans of this earth. Truly a message of unity, and a beacon of hope. Can't wait to see more just like this, 10/10."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,6/10,"I got to see this film a few a days back and It was....mind numbingly mediocre just like most other MCU films. Maybe I had too high expectations for it due to the hype but a lot of elements felt way worse than other marvel flicks.The action(both fight scenes and action set pieces) ranged from semi-decent to God awful. The final fight in particular had terrible CGI and wonky physics. The normal fight scenes weren't that good either. They were both shot(sometimes it feels like the cameraman is having a seizure while the combatants are having a slap fight, sample of what you're going to get I guess) and choreographed terribly. It's like they watched the fight style of the Raid films but forgot hire good stuntmen and choreographers.The MCU can do really intense fight scenes like the elevator fight in TWS but nothing in this movie comes even close to that. So anyone expecting badass fights based on BPs scenes in civil war, you're going to be massively disappointed.Edit: sample of the final fight I am talking about as wellThis isn't a work print. This is what you will get in the cinema. I got called a troll for saying it. So you can look at it yourselves.If anybody thought the CGI in wonder woman climax was a turn off , then you're certainly not going to like this and unlike WW the CGI is like this in most CGI heavy scenes in the film.(particularly the car chase yikes).The world building is good if you think Bright and the Star wars prequels had great world building. It just felt artificial for the most part(again partly because of the mediocre CGI), you're not going to get a memorable location like the cantina bar or the Troll market from Hellboy 2 which feels like real places with it's own unique personalities. Wakanda for the most part like Asgard has a few cool establishing shots where we see some interesting designs but they're are not really fleshed out much and again the uneven CGI isn't exactly helping.The villain is above 99% of other marvel villains for he mere fact he has a lasting impact on he hero and for being somewhat sympathetic, though I felt the characterization itself was a bit disjointed. However his dialogue is often absolute cringe, he seems to awkwardly switch on and off his AAVE which just seems forced. I thought his final piece dialogue for example was absolutely forced and cringeworthy. The actor, I think did his best with what he got and he felt more interesting than the rest of the characters in the movie.The music was decent in this movie(though I didn't care for the rap which was mostly centered around Eric but then again I am not huge rap fan, so don't out too much weight on my opinion on this one). Most of it's themes are pretty obvious and blatant as well.This movie definitely isn't going to win any awards for subtlety.Overall, the movie just felt generic.I know movies are subjective but anyone who says this is a masterpiece or groundbreaking in anyway whether it be effects, acting,action or even the plot(I don't think this movie does anything new or anything that's even new for CBMs except for the nearly all black cast I guess) is quite frankly a fanboy or someone who hasn't watched much films.That's all I have to say about this movie. It's solid 5/10 for me but I am guessing if you liked the previous MCU films you'll probably enjoy this as well but for others go in with tempered expectations."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,I really do not understand how anyone can give this movie a bad review. I think a lot of people giving this a negative movie are Marvel haters that facebook took down.This movie was soooo good. Erik Killmonger is Marvel's best villain to date in movies.Go see the black panther ASAP!!
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"This movie is fantastic as a stand alone film and part of the MCU. ***There are a few spoilers ahead***I was worried given all the hype that this film would not deliver on the level of hype it was receiving, but it does. The action is fantastic, the characters are well developed and amazing. The real issues they bring up are amazing and it's only in small doses, so it does not alienate certain movie goers. It does give you a perspective from others point of views, and thought provoking. The conflict between what to do and what not to do(especially between the protagonist and antagonist) is what is most compelling to me. The action scenes are amazing (except for one), and the creative minds behind what technology can all be gained by vibranium is sensational. Like all movies, there are a couple flaws, it got a little slow and it is predictable. That is not the movies fault though as it is within this universe so it has restrictions on where they can take things within one installment. The CGI in the fight scene at the end between T'challa and Kilmonger was a little poor, but did not take away from the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job, there wasn't one bad performance in the film. Overall 10/10!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,2/10,"So over hyped and drenched in slo-mo CG it is hard to remember this is a MCU COMIC! The acting was... well... marginal at best...unless you are looking for attitude at every turn. Marvel needs to really strip out the socio-political tripe from their movies. This isn't the first but this one dripped in it REALLY ruining the MCU story line.
Speaking of the MCU connection... THERE WAS NONE .
This sits as an island of CG phantasm to someone's ego and is NOT the Black Panther I knew well in Lee's fantasy realm of comic stories.
No background ever given to support the absurdist fantasyland, and no REAL story beyond...""We need help - Call this guy"" . THAT was the weakest part... No sustainable story line so it was hard for the characters to ever emotionally develop or connection.... just rubber suit flexing for 2 hours.
Expected so much more. That Guardians of the Galaxy is still rated King of all the MCU productions... not just in attendance and financial success.... but in pure Lee Production and being true to the Legendary MCU characters.
TRY AGAIN please Stan. You can do so much better. And viewers can certainly find a better way to spend two painful hours than cringing at these badly delivered lines.
NEXT from MCU!!....Waiting Stan.... now you owe us all."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"If there is anything that makes you more happier than watching a marvel movie first day-first show, then this film is for you. Just a humble reminder, this review is SPOILER FREE,so read along.
Firstly, you aren't a true marvel fan if you are reading this, but if you are not sure and are confused about the mixed reception this movie is getting, then may be you should consider going through this article.
CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence? The rest of the cast faithfully presented as their respective soles demanded.The writers did an amazing job in telling us a story of Wakanda, and linking it to El dorado. It does gets a bit predictable at times, but you do have a good share of scenes where you involuntarily will go ""Ohhhhhs"" & ""Ahhhhhhs"".
The action scenes are few but brilliantly executed,and the Wakandan empire, the most advance country in marvel cinematic universe does blow your mind with all its science and technology.I can identify why people are not appreciate the movie and the ratings are also not what it deserved. The first one being inadequate action (perhaps?). The trailer packed us all with loads of excitement,but the movie was more of a great plot and drama but a bit less of action. Also, there are obviously going to be comparison between this movie and the last marvel film, Thor-Ragnarok. The third instalment for the Thor series, is considered,by far, the best marvel film ever, and mainly due to its superb comic timing. Black panther too does boast scenes which tickle your funny bone, but we also need to understand that this is the first Black panther stand alone movie, and considering that the movie is fit to be called a blockbuster. Not to forget what marvel movies are famous for, a good Stan Lee cameo and a post credit scene as well, which I not going to reveal.DO NOT READ this paragraph if you haven't watched the movie till now.
The greatest disappointment was that there was no sign of the soul stone. There were a lot of valid arguments and speculations about soul stone to be introduced in this movie, which didn't come true.My conclusion is that no matter what the world thinks,this is a marvel film and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther was a really well made movie which I fairly enjoyed. The general story was really good for a intro arc to the MCU, and had a good balance with humor. Now the villian Killmonger was very well acted by Michael B Jordan and it's very sad to see him die as it felt like the movie didn't show a lot of him in it. The problems I had with this movie were some of the fight scenes in the beginning and one at the end. The ones in the beginning were too fast paced and you had no idea what was going on. The one at the end when Black Panther is fighting Killmonger, at one point they seem very cartoonish and it makes the scene look rigid and not agile (or catlike). Sometimes it was also hard to know what they were saying due to accent but you still got the general idea of what they were trying to say. I was very excited for this movie but I feel like it was over-hyped. There wasn't a lot of action and the director saying that it would be the James Bond of the MCU was not shown in this movie at all. It felt more of a Lion King story where T'Challa must fight for the throne. It did make me close to crying at 2 points in the movie but never did it it make me butt clench in the action scenes. I will still rate this movie a solid 8/10!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"Oof. If you're going to see this movie, don't have high expectations. One of the worst Marvel films I have ever seen. Marvel tried too hard with this movie, and the result is a sad, all-over-the-place film that disappoints viewers. The movie was way too long, to the point where I almost walked out of the theater because it was dragging out so long. The special effects were not great and the movie was totally predictable. Save yourself the time and money, and don't go see this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"Honestly, this is possibly the worst Marvel film that has been done to date. The cinematography and after effects were awful, the worst that Marvel has ever done, nothing looked polished and you can tell there was blue and green screens everywhere which is unlike every other Marvel film.For an Origins story, they didn't tell how this Native tribe became technologically advanced enough to start building things with Vibranium, and we are just meant to believe that a people in this situation can?The fight / car chase scenes were lacking a real punch which you could really get behind, and just a bit meh for a Marvel film - felt more like I was watching a Fox Marvel film than an MCU one.A number of the scenes also seemed to be copied from films like Thor Ragnarock - fight on the bridge, the panning into Wakanda very similar to panning into Asgard/Vallhallah, The CSI Agent is just Phil Colson in a new person, the pursuit scene after blowing up the jail was in Captain America.Overall the first Marvel film I have left the Cinema going meh."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Black panther is totally different from other marvel movies. the storyline is decent , good casting the only problem i had with this movie was that they didn't really give michael B jordan enough screen time and not enough action scene. but the car chase awesome as usual and killmonger and t'challa fight great go watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"The whole setting of the movie was very well planned! Humor passes here and there and definitely adds to the movie! Man , the VFX looked so awesome I felt like they were real! Flaws comes around sometimes during the movie. The plot started out fantastically but the conclusion was a bit unrealistic and was the only major downer. If you conclude yourself to watching this movie, you'll definitely notice whats missing and whats overdone.Overall, I'll definitely recommend this movie to people whos looking for an interesting sci-fi adventure with humor in it! Although I wouldn't prefer to watch several times, the 2h 14m felt like 50 minutes! This MCU movie stands out as a great start for 2018"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"Relatable villain, kickass ensemble, breathtaking effects."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"My feeling after the movie - bored, something I won't watch again.Here is why I didnt like it (during the movie I felt like leaving, and thats a bad sign for someone who goes to the cinema every week): 1. All action scenes are blurred (you get a headache) and mostly dark (you can hardly see anything).2. While the movie is long in length the story feels short. Quite a few scenes are over stretched to add minutes but they dont add any content etc.3. Most actors act very bad. Ok how do you define bad. Well I guess their acting and emotions dont really match the situations 4. There are a few jokes, which feel very very misplaced and very low. I watched it on the big screen, so there many people around, but the laughs were pretty quiet.For me 5.5 out of 10 and I would never watch it again."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,8/10,"Great film. Chadwick and Michael B. killed it. Killmonger is the 3rd best villain behind Loki and Vulture in the MCU for me. BP had the right balance of tech and mysticism.Danai, Letitia, and Winston were my highlights. Their comedy was at the right tone for me. Not slapstick, not over-the-top, not snarky. Just subtle enough to keep you smiling.Must also give a shout out to Ryan Coogler. You have delivered something beautiful. I hope we see an announcement for BP2 just after Infinity War.I'm glad that people have differing opinions on this film because there are flaws. Pretending they're not there is being disingenuous. It's why I didn't give the film a 10/10.I don't like that Klaue was wasted in the way he was. He was expertly teased in Ultron and was brilliant in the first half of BP, but then, he's shot and he's dead? It was almost as criminal with what they did to Crossbones in Civil War.The CGI/fight scenes were blurry and hard to follow in parts.Forest Whitaker has to stop taking roles where he dies.But on the other hand, making out that this film ruined your childhood, hurt society and is simply Disneyfied dross says more about the reviewer than the film.I must admit though, seeing one review comparing Black Panther to Happy Feet made me laugh."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,2/10,"I am very Hugh fan of Marval's since time i saw first X-man Spider-man Iron-man Movies. This movie according to me was complete disaster the director forgot the actually concept of the movie and the universe they are in . It is not a documentary movie where your trying to give social message to people. I understand it was about black community and respect that but. Ryan Coogler forgot and was trying just portray about social understanding and this movie is not at all about social message its all about Avengers,the Superhero whom we love to watch .movie was just emotional drama i fell like i wasted my weekend and my excitement of black panther which i was waiting form very long time and what i was expecting there was nothing such happening in the movie .and Please do-not compare (Erik Killmonger) to (Loki) Killmonger looked like a circus freak to me . Director did not use Micheal Jordan very well it was Directors mistake ... 2-Stars 
It was completely out of Emotions sorry if I hurted anyone's feelings."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"I was very disappointing movie and it is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in many years and definitely the worst Marvel movie. After 15 minutes I felt like leaving and could't finish the movie as I left being extremely bored, bad acting and above all poor CGI making the movie quite unwatchable. 
I think this movie wont have a sequel and if it does for sure I will never even watch the trailer."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is a truly beautiful film. It's sad to see so may bad reviews and ratings but it sure didn't disappoint. At a time like this, it's important to have a film like this out there. Great action, good narrative and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Go check it out."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,10/10,"I've been a Marvel fan all my life, and I've practically grown up watching the films. I went in to Black Panther expecting the usual Marvel humor, and the sometimes basic plot. But this movie blew away my expectations. Not only did everything look spectacular, the story flowed well, the actors all had an amazing performance, the soundtrack itself was great, and it was honestly a refreshing Marvel movie. The humor wasn't cheesy, but also not absent. My biggest compliment for it would be that it did not feel like a superhero movie. This movie was not about T'challa the superhero. It was about T'challa the king. And I loved that."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,3/10,"This is the movie that makes DC look better than Marvel. Accompanied by bad actors, bad dialouges and bad story line."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,2/10,"I liked the character a lot in Civil War, but here... They only talk about how African-American had trouble in the past, and that they should be equal. I thought this movie will be fun, but it actually is a lesson about politics and equality. I'm all for that, but when I go to see a Marvel superhero movie, I expect action and humor... This movie has that for total of 10 minutes."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,If I don't rate it 10/10 they're gonna get me.It's actually quite average. It's decent. It's okay. Watch it. You will no matter what I say so... go ahead. Just know that it's a decent movie that isn't worth your money when there's better things to waste your time on.Oh shoot they're here I went on speaking my honest opinion for too long  AAAAHHHHH!!!
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,8/10,The movie was to the point. It didn't have any of the usual 'Marvel' thing. Thats's why it was so good.Killmonger's character was written very well. His pain and agony to overthrow T'Challa from the Wakandan Empire was neatly sketched. The movie was intense and BG score will brilliant.I would totally rewatch it just for Killmonger!
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"Everything about this film felt effortless. It has to be (for me) one of the less 'forced' Marvel films i have seen. Take Avengers 2 or Iron Man 2, the comedy and action felt forced compared to this film. 
Such a great introduction to a Character with huge potential within Marvel.
The visuals were incredible and the acting was just faultless.
Obviously I hugely respect the cultural aspect of this film, and felt it was extremely fitting for the world we live in today and brought a new culture to Holywood.Top film."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,7/10,"I'm pretty surprised Black Panther holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was enjoyable but to say it ""elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights"" is an overstatement."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,1/10,"Lets be honest here this movie is being massively overrated by so many celebrates because it was released in black history month! I'm fed up with people lying about movies to get more people to watch it.Out of all the Marvel movies Black Panther is very very average! There is no WOW moments in the whole movie. The first hour the movie is trying to tell you a story and I myself found it very very boring and found myself nodding off every now and then, The only part of the movie that was good was the Big fight at the end that lasted say 15mins Would I watch this movie again ? No. I generally found the movie very boring..... I love pretty much all the Marvel movies because you just want more and more well not with this one."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,,"As far as the film goes this is your standard Marvel film in that they are releasing a new Marvel film every two weeks. I don't how many they think we can watch, but anyway for now they are trying to milk it as far and as much a possible.
The message is bad though. This time the Marvel team has decided to tell us that isolation and black people staying home and where their origins are is a good thing. It is unbelievable that an anti-migration anti races mixing message is allowed in 2018. I am white and work with so many black people and there is no problem. So disappointed.
Yeah, I have to agree with some others the Jordan guy cannot act. Seriously"
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"Fantastic film for the hole family,non stop thriller that has alot of culture"
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,5/10,"I was expecting more what with all the hype this film was getting. I have a friend who went to see it 4 times and ranks it as one of his favorite Marvel movies and I just don't get where he's coming from. For the majority of the film I was bored. Nothing really kept me invested and I didn't feel like T'challa (Black Panther) was challenged by the responsibility of being both a king and a superhero.  The most memorable parts of this film were; an above average villein (for a Marvel film), jarringly bad CG (took me out of the experience more than once), and a really stale meme from two or three years ago.  In the end this is yet another painfully average Marvel movie and I have to admit I have grown weary of the formula."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,6/10,"Disconnected story line, lame joke, average acting quality. So so time-killing movie but not something I enjoy."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,5/10,"I was really excited to see this based off reviews and Black panthers appearance in Capt America as he was dope. But, boy was I disappointed. This would have been cool to watch at home. Im not sure how this is being compared to Iron man, deadpool, antman. try again. This felt like some African star wars Odyssey. This did NOT feel like a ""superhero"" movie at all. im sorry to say but if this was an all ""white"" cast, this would not get the praise it received."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,9/10,"*BLACK PANTHER REVIEW* Direction: Ryan Coogler knocks this out of the park, he's 3 for 3 when it comes to directing! He should hopefully be getting more work after this. Story: Black Panther has a good but sometimes predictable story. While the story has some touching moments, it contains some familiar Marvel tropes.Script: The script is excellent, containing good jokes and some powerful emotional dialogue particularly from Killmonger (coming up). It also provides an extremely relevant message, a type that Marvel or any other comic-book film has never done before.Performances: Ooooh, the performances are incredible across the board! Chadwick Boseman does a nice job portraying a half superhero/half king and Lupita Nyong'o's great too. However, the real standouts are Okoye (Danai Gurira), Shuri (Letitia Wright), Klaue (Andy Serkis) and of course KILLMONGER (Michael.B.Jordan)! Danai shows badass fighting skill while still having a heart, Letitia is HILARIOUS as Shuri as well as endearing and has excellent chemistry with Chadwick. Andy made me smile everytime he appeared with his goofy performance. But then Michael comes in. Killmonger is 100% the best villain since Loki, a bad guy with clear motivations who allows you to sympathize with him. Michael somehow portraying him as enraged and charismatic simultaneously and leaves quite the mark on you even after the credits by giving many good points. I could make a whole essay on him if I could honestly, he's that complex...Visuals and Other Aspects: The movie has stunning costume and production design (I LOVE Shuri's lab!). However, there is some bad green screen moments in some parts of the film.All in all, Black Panther, while a little overhyped, is an amazing movie definitely worth seeing in theaters. If you get the chance, SEE THIS MOVIE!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 August 2018,8/10,"Very enjoyable and entertaining movie, well made. One of the best Marvel mivies lately."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,1/10,"Same story of super hero born
Unnecessary visual effects 
Out the current world.
Worst story .i recommend don't watch
Don't believe in the extraordinary ratings by rating agencies"
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,1/10,"Worst story
Unnecessary visual effects
Visual effects out of world"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2018,2/10,"How to chuck themes for a lot of good movies into one
and get one terrible one. 
Ok so, Matrix movies, James Bond, Superman, Spiderman etc, plus political crap, this is the result. 
Walked out half way through, so perhaps it got better. 
So maybe a bit unfair."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,7/10,"Honestly when saw this movie preview before hitting theaters I wasn't at all interested in seeing this. For some reason it did not appeal to me and I love watching these types of movies. I thought I'd watch here at home, you know don't judge a book by its cover but I have to say it was better than I'd thought it would be, not the best. It seemed to lose my interest in the middle of it. Only scene that I really like was the car chase. Good actors in it, but not to make the movie any better."
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,9/10,Good movie wanted it to be longer show more of the city see more of a story
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,1/10,"Absolute rubbish, we had high hopes for this film as the initial ratings looked promising but most fight scenes felt like cheap 1970s Star Trek recreations. 
Bad CGI, terrible plot however the cast and acting saved it slightly."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,4/10,"Black Panther is now the 18th instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last before what was envisioned as the ""End Game"" when the first launched, in Infinity War later this year. Having debuted in 2016's Avengers: Civil War, Chadwick Boseman brought a grace to the future King of Wakanda as well as an interesting opportunity to show a unique setting in the Marvel Universe - Wakanda is an African land that has isolated itself from the wider world for thousands of years to preserve its unique technological advances brought on by a Vibranium meteor crashing there. In the soil atop the meteor a seemingly magic plant grows that gives those that drink it the power of the mystical Black Panther - protector of the realm. Boseman's T'Challa is to take up the crown upon his return following his father's death in Civil War, which the film happens only weeks after.Disney/Marvel have, as do most big budget franchises, a bad history of letting directors follow their visions without constraint or interference. In recent times they did permit Rian Johnson free reign all over Star Wars and James Gunn was able to operate almost in isolation with the second Guardians, with both perhaps displaying why they had been so reluctant. This happened in the wake of the Edgar Wright / Antman situation that disappointed most of everyone, Wright most of all after nearly a decade trying to bring it to the big screen. For the job of helming Black Panther Marvel inlisted Creed director Ryan Coogler which leads to talk about the politics of the film. Briefly. Black Panther is being toted, wrongly, as the first black superhero (Blade, Hancock, Spawn, Steel) and is also the first wilfully racially segregated production in decades by having an all black cast and crew, with very few exceptions. Discussing the aim of the films political messaging is not the objective here, though I will simply say that prohibiting a person from working on a film for being born in the wrong skin should be unacceptable. Yes, it takes place in Africa so there would be an overwhelming majority of black people, though realities racial dispersion doesn't ordinarily prohibit achieving a ""diverse"" on screen group. Any further reading of the political elements will be put aside unless relevant to the film making choices or some other significant role.Coogler brought in his Creed leading star, Michael B. Jordan, to play nemesis Killmonger mirroring T'Challa's calm with a burning rage. Returning to the MCU after a brief cameo in Age of Ultron is Andy Serkis as arms dealer and Vibranium extraordinaire Ulysses Klaue, now complete with a lethal limb. Other notable additions are Dania Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o as one of the Kings key advisors/ generals and love interest respectively, Forrest Whitaker as spiritual leader and former spy, Angela Basset as mother of the king, Sterling K. Brown lining up as leader of a Wakandan tribe and Martin Freeman as the token - I mean - CIA operative Everett Ross. 
Narratively, the opening is choppy, jumping through essentially three different openings back to back. It does occasionally settle in to a pattern only to just as soon forget about it, as such certain elements or plots end up being rushed through when others seemed overlong. This then takes away the punch of certain arcs conclusions, removing the resonance or significance Coogler tried to dictate. There is also a deal of continent hopping through the first half that adds to the choppy feeling before we really touch down in Wakanda. Once there, T'Challa must earn his throne through ritual combat before beginning his first real kingly duties - tracking down Ulysses Klaue, the only man to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. In doing so, he crosses paths with Everett Ross who is also pursuing Klaue. During the pursuit of Klaue, Killmonger begins to assert himself against T'Challa and challenge his right to rule, questioning the isolationism and hording of advanced technology. It is in dealing with these topics the film does occasionally get distracted trying to preach to its audience and score modern day political points, that the actual debate being played out fails to go deeper than the surface. Other conflicts emerge when the film tries to frame historical issues in a negative manner, even having enemies agree about its awfulness, before the ending sets up Wakanda taking the action the film had been decrying. This not done in a ""now I understand history a little better"" but more of a ""it was wrong when they did it, but its okay for us"" fashion. As is tradition with Marvel films we do get an opening action scene which exposed one weakness in Coogler's directing. Much of the action is filmed too close to follow, with the near pitch black of the setting only exacerbating the problem. The later, more grounded action elements fair better, highlighting the more athletic nature of Boseman, as well as displaying some of Coogler's flair for style. Jordan's physicality is equally well performed, no doubt thanks to time spent boxing in recent years, continuing to tell the story in his actions. The biggest flaw with the larger set-piece action scenes is that they are undermined by the low-quality CGI on display, an issue that plagues the film. Larger creations, such as the animals, stick out like a sore thumb, never once creating a sense of tangibility. When we do get to Black Panther leaping around the screen, he looks very rubbery, reminiscent of Neo in the Matrix Reloaded. Even simpler computer enhancements are poor; a scene that only required the generation of a small crowd on a cliffside ends up looking like the creator just copied and pasted the same 4 small groups to pad out the shot. Similarly, some of the rendered backdrops look like the back projections from Goldfinger. This issue is not solely the effects failing but the look of the real elements also, as everything - from rocks, to garments to buildings and people - is pristine. No scene takes place in a setting that you would describe as weathered-looking or worn, with every surface looking polished or whole rooms seeming sterile. These choices end up making the sets the feel very much like sets and the spotless costumes feel like costumes. Compounded with scenes being lit very flat and uniformly, the world never feels real enough to fall in to. Wakanda's place as the battlefield with Thanos was given a skeleton crew dress rehearsal in the final act, as Wakanda's forces combat an insurgency. Hopefully, the all-round computer effects will be at least average, which would be several steps improved than what was on display here. Given that the showdown takes place away from a major metropolitan centre unlike almost all its fellow comic movies, it is possible the strong flat lighting in the open fields made the effect less, well, effective. When the compositing was shaky, the problem was compounded by the pure CG additions, like the war Rhinos. Looking more like they belong in the stampede from the original Jumanji, begs the question where all the money went in the 200-million-dollar budget. At no point do they seem real, which in a sense means the Rhinos are at least consistent with the rest of the effects. Perhaps the effects here were undercooked to allow more work on the Infinity War renderings and effects.Marvel's other significant element is its comedy which Coogler deploys more ably and more sparingly than some of his recent counterparts. Most of the best laughs come from either Serkis's manic performance or Boseman's flat composure as king momentarily lifting. When Boseman appeared in Civil War he was a fresh lively element, here Coogler has him playing it too stoically, turning him in to a blank slate. Beyond flashing his perfect grin, there is little emotion for him to work with, no real intensity to tap in to. Boseman, as does practically every member of the cast, performs solidly with what's given, it's just that what's given to them is often uninspired. Letitia Wright, playing T'Challa's little sister Shuri, plays the role closet to a comedic relief as a stand in Q - creating new tech, weapons and armour. Not all of it lands but there's nothing particularly egregious about it either - minus her one or two racist remarks. Given the highly promoted segregation of the production it is perhaps unsurprising that there are direct, actual racist moments in the films political messaging. These range from claiming that history museums are, essentially, active crime scenes full of stolen possessions (such as 7th century farm equipment) or to a chamber full of African people silencing Martin Freeman as his whiteness prohibits him from speaking. It is played off with a joke, but he never gets to actually speak. If inclusivity is the message you want to broadcast, moments like these run counter to it.Certain character motivations towards to the third act become wafer thin, bordering on illogical. Particularly when T'Challa is accused of a failing without ever explaining his view of what actually happened, causing the accuser to betray his friend of decades in an instant. Another major illogical choice is regarding the means of the Black Panthers powers - on the site of the meteor impact a flower grows which, when ground up and drank, gives the consumer the powers of the Black Panther. The issue comes in that only one person ever drank it at any one time. Surely a war faring people, as the entire world was thousands of years ago, would have dispensed this drink amongst the ranks and conquered the world. Perhaps just dispense it to the Wakanda Guard to ensure the borders are truly impenetrable. The situation is partially resolved by the films end but the with Infinity War seemingly staging a decent time in Wakanda (if not the films finale) the existence of a dispensable superpower potion should logically play in to that. All in all, Black Panther is an averagely written, mostly well directed, well-acted, horribl"
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,8/10,"I think this movie have a good story line. good visual effect and telling the audience about ""wakanda"" before the Avengers infinity war."
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2018,1/10,"Slow pacing.
Don't watch it. 
The fight scenes aren't exciting. 
(I really just wanted to say that the movie was so slow and that kind of movies makes me board)"
BLACK PANTHER,23 May 2018,7/10,"I don't understand why this movie is loved so much, it was mediocre at best for me. Went in with big expectations with the early response it was getting but left the cinema thoroughly disappointed. It was so cliched"
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,1/10,First black superhero movie was a real disappointment indeed. it was more like an ametour cartoon. dialogues were ridiculous. i was humiliating that the producers had not taken it serious enough. it seemed like a cheap excuse which is worse than not excusing.
BLACK PANTHER,3 April 2018,10/10,"I wanted to see for myself what all the hype was all about with both positive and negative reviews. Personally, I am not a fanatic of Marvel but cannot speak enough praise for the directorship, production and cast of this Movie. At first I felt it was a bit slow but I now realise it was necessary narrative in the setting up for the complexity of the story line. I have to commend all the efforts of the cast on bringing to life the characters they portrayed. The cinematics, costumes and soundtrack selection was on point and all contributed to making this epic, history marking movie, a must see in my books."
BLACK PANTHER,4 April 2018,7/10,"I went to go this movie with my friends about 2 weeks ago. We had heard no bad reviews of the movie besides the occasional ""spite"" reviews, so I started to get some high expectations. I decided to just let myself see it through the eyes of just another comic book fan, and in that regard, it definitely succeeded. Cool fights, interesting characters, kinda the works for Marvel.My biggest concern was the obvious political implications surrounding the movie. No one can deny this film definitely sparked controversy in that department, however, to the films credit, it was very legit. Aside from one line that I felt was a little gratuitous, it kept the politics strict to the story. Even the villain had an obviously horrifying plan that was recognized as psychopathic and induced mostly by trauma and the seething resentment he felt towards The Black Panther.Outside of all that, the movie seemed mostly above average. It doesn't have the mass appeal that I thought it would have, and some scenes seem very lackluster. I also hate how they typecast Forest Whitaker!! Ever since his role as Saw Gurera in Rouge One, he seems to have the same demeanor and overall role here. A side character whose importance is only to move the main character towards they're so-called ""destiny"" only to die horribly half-way through the film!! He is a good actor, and I really wanna see someone give him some major role in a film one of these days.Here's my end results for the film:
Story:7
Characters:8
CGI/special effects:7
Dialogue/script:7 (became kind of predictable)
Acting:9 (honestly my favorite thing about the movie)
Action:7"
BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2018,8/10,"It's a good movie with great action scenes e scenario. The story of the film is very predictable, but it's fun."
BLACK PANTHER,7 April 2018,10/10,Very well made movie with a lot of action. Loved it. One of a kind
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,1/10,"Overused storyline, boring sense of justice from the king, overused genius-laid-back character
No charming character
Killed the only charming villain in favour of the boring one
...
No plot twist !!!
Where is my money?!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 April 2018,10/10,"This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."
BLACK PANTHER,21 April 2018,2/10,"I guess many professional reviewers believe that this movie has to be good because the main character is black. So you see all of these rave reviews pandering to the black audience....Well... One dimensional characters and no real story line worth following makes for a crappy movie in my book. I was disappointed, but what do I know I'm just a white guy."
BLACK PANTHER,29 April 2018,7/10,"It is in fact the best action movie shown lately in the big screen, really worth watching, amazing quality, with fantastic acting and very good directing job, congratulations Mr. Ryan Coogler. 
If we could go back in time I would just recommend trying to take a real acting from the main villain Michael B. Jordan, because he's acting is quite poor, he moves like a ""moving head dog for car"", and he forces acting instead of feeling his role, lines and reacting to what's around (just watch the trailer of ""Creed"" and he's acting didn't changed much, he's the same in both, just with different lines. His last scene becomes so lame, embarrassing and unbearable to watch, he just forces a crying scene, feeling pity for himself. Sorry to point this out but if it wasn't for this I would rate it with 9 or 10 stars.Chadwick Boseman performance is perfect, he is the ideal king, humble, full of determination, focused, relaxed, eyes wide open, protective, caring for those around, trustworthy, concern, decisive, straight to the point, a truly hero, a fighter and a shield of the true values. All this qualification is what I see without lines, just expression, just acting quality, he shows all that by simply being, by his presence.
All characters were simply fantastic doing their perfect job delivering their best performance.
Personally I love the accent, it brings a lot of quality to the entire movie, gives also more moments of comedy and laughter. 
All rituals mixed with a more modern dynamic gives a cool lifting atmosphere. The cool greet it's perfect for the film, the kingdom sort of rigid and full of rules becomes soft, happy and lighter.
The idea of giving Winston Duke as M'baku and his boys the sound of dogs it's just brilliant, very original, funny at the same time. His character gives some good nice laughter also, because he's very relaxed and very into his role."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2018,2/10,"Black Panther was not a good movie. I don't care about the political message. I agree with it. Everyone should be treated equally, and we should be helping out other people whenever we have the ability to do so. However, just because the political or social message was good, doesn't mean the movie was good. It simply means the message was. I was actually super excited to see lack panther. However, after watching it, there were a lot of problems with it. 1. The CGI was terrible. It was barely above the level of the amazing Spider-Man series. 2. It contributed barely anything to the MCU plot. Simply that they have have a ton of tech and 3. They did a terrible job of making it realistic. From the ridiculous ""silent shoes"" to the fact that what is essentially Atlantis has been sitting in plain sight, the directors did a bad job of making it realistic. 4. Bad characters. Almost none of the characters were interesting or likable enough to actually care about. With his sister and the villain being the only exceptions. I actually almost wanted the villain to win because he was basically the only one I liked or actually felt for at all. 5. It was outright boring. There was barely any plot till most of the way through the movie, and what little action there was was slow, unrealistic, and uninteresting.6. Black Panther is OP. Essentially if it wasn't for the monorail system, both of them would've been indestructible, and essentially invincible. There is no limit to the power of black panther, so it's not cool to watch. Just like Superman, and debatably vision, they're so powerful, they're not cool. TL;DR: Basically, boiled down, I don't give a crap whether a movie is about a girl or guy or black person or white person or whatever. A movie is good because it's a good movie. Because it has good characters, plot, etc. - not because of it's main character's gender or race, and not because of the social message, no matter how good that message is."
BLACK PANTHER,29 June 2018,2/10,"Wanted to love this. Watched it with my nine year old, who within five minutes said it was boring. So sad, we love Marvel. Have watched Thor Raganrok at least thirty times! We will only be watching this once, boring story and boring film."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,"The only thing that took away a bit of my interest were the costumes, decor, interior design. Colourfull people yes, colourfull clothing yes, acting no, storyline no, complete rubbish. Boring, completely overrated.
That fence retaining the rhino's really, NOT that rhino could have sneezed that fence away...
Somewhere in the middle of the movie some character says -Whassup!- the only ""sentence"" without an accent use. Even the computer generated voice had an accent??
Man oh man, this was a bad movie."
BLACK PANTHER,23 May 2018,10/10,Black Panther was a amazing film with beautiful sets and great cgi. Coogler really brings Wakanda to life in this movie and the actors are amazing.
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2018,9/10,"This movie is primarily for Marvel fans, those who love the Marvel comic book characters and want to see them portrayed in the Marvel movies. It is a comic book fantasy come to the big screen. It is not to be taken seriously, it is only a movie. Members of white supremacist groups and the KKK and their ilk will probably not be devoted fans of Black Panther, they will not embrace each other with the Wakanda salute. As for myself, I am a true fan of Marvel and welcome Black Panther and all the other Marvel comic book characters into the rapidly expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe."
BLACK PANTHER,5 July 2018,10/10,"Loved the costumes for this music, the sounds track, the special effects - and the the main villain: it's so easy to identify with him, his story his background and why he does coming from a specific mindset."
BLACK PANTHER,20 September 2018,4/10,"As others have noted, this film was extraordinarily overrated and hyped by various media outlets. It is a super-hero flick like so many, but it falls below others in that it fails to encourage the audience to become invested in either the hero or even the villain until the final act. Without a clear tension in the plot the film fumbles along through various minor crises with tons of CGI, gunfire, and action until the sudden appearance of a short-lived climatic rise involving characters for whom the audience does not care. Mediocre among the ever-increasing pile of banal superhero films."
BLACK PANTHER,30 June 2018,10/10,This is got to be the best movie I have seen in a long time. the action in it and the special effects are just amazing as well as the cast of characters.
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2018,10/10,"This movie was very touching, inspirational, breathe taking. Look forward to a black panther 2"
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2018,10/10,"Black Panther was a great movie, and the first of its kind. It is rare to see this side of black men. Usually there is a lot of type casting, but here is where we get to see a glimpse of what the world could've been like. Yes, superheros don't exist, but we got to see a country in Africa where almost everyone is living a prosperous life. Watch the movie and form your own opinion."
BLACK PANTHER,27 June 2018,2/10,"After much deliberation, I felt compelled to add my review here. I'm a big fan of all things Marvel - have loved all movies so far and despite my age, watching its animated series on the TV is a guilty pleasure. Having said that, Black Panther just didnt work on any level, for me personally. I thoroughly loved the introduction to the character in ""Civil war"", the way he was showcased and the entire persona just impressed the hell outta me so but naturally, the fact that an MCU movie was gonna be based on it raised my expectations a notch above the rest. I so wanted to like it, but well, after I came out of the multiplex I had no words to express ...the indifference I felt for the Character and the movie as a whole. Disappointed - by the effects, the characters, the action sequences - pretty much every aspect! The fact that its so well liked - is beyond me. Have no clue how it managed to rake up such moolah and likes across, but for me personally - A HUGE LETDOWN !"
BLACK PANTHER,16 September 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is just one of the latest in what has been an impressive string of movies in the Marvel cinematic universe. Even with all of the hype leading up, I did not expect this movie to be nearly as good as other superhero movies that had come out prior such as Thor: Ragnarok, Spider-Man: Homecoming, or Captain America: Civil War. I was dead wrong. Chadwick boseman could not have been a better choice to play the film's main character T'Challa and that goes for the rest of the star-studded cast. Across the board the acting is excellent and it is all driven by a plot that is so good it has you even feeling sympathy for the antagonist in the plot Killmonger. Black panther is the first mainstream movie to ever feature a black protagonist superhero as well as feature a predominantly African American cast. At the start of the film we are given some context as to who these Wakandans are and where they come from including a saying so catchy it had myself yelling it out of the theatre for days ( WAKANDA FOREVA!!!!) The music even sets the mood of whatever the current scene is perfectly to the point where you are totally invested in everything panther. Boseman is both charismatic and resilient in every way in this film and shows incredible mental strength even more than physical. Not to mention the suit is by far the coolest ever made! As I watched this, I could not believe just how blown away I truly was. I came in knowing nothing about this place wakanda and it's universe and characters and came out wishing I was young enough to be them all for Halloween this year. Michael B. Jordan is so good that when he overthrows T'Challa I was actually mad in the theatre. Everything about this movie screams greatness and a classic. Although the film did not have quite as much humor as Thor did, the story was so much emotionally deeper and complete. In reviews I like to at least attempt to point out something I feel could have been done differently, or better, but with Black Panther I truly cannot. It was that good. There will be sequels simply because it is a marvel movie, but if there never was this would go down as an all time classic not only for its quality but also the importance it serves to the African American kids who never have seen a superhero their same skin color. This movie hits on all notes and levels and blew me away and continues to every time I watch it. I've watched it 6 times. Good job Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,23 September 2018,3/10,"To get this out of the way, I review movies based on their quality not their message. And this movie is ungodly average. To get the goods out of the way, suprisingly the villain was alright and had a pretty good story arch and the story overall was entertaning and kept your attention. Now onto the list of bads. First of all, for a marcel movie the CGI sucks. There was not one scene that I saw something in CGI and thought it was real. Somehow the main character, isn't even the most interesting/compelling character in the entire movie. The Black Panther (the character) has no real personality that I could see (Please tell me descriptions of his personality so I can piece that together if possible thanks.). The humor in this movie made my eyes roll to the back of my skull. Black Panther's sister made a ""What are those"" joke and at that time I felt like leavin the thearter and screaming for the next hour.Now a marcel movie isn't made without a good villan right? I mean the villan is fine, but his motives and his plans are so laughably stupid. (SPOILERS PAST THIS PART) The villan Killomonger feels like Africans must get revenge on all Caucasian people because they have been oppressors throughout history, basically he wants to kill all white people using wakandas advanced technology. Okay okay, fort of all, nobody and I mean NOBODY on earth in the MCU would let that happen. Remember the avengers are still a thing, and one black panther knock off vs the avengers(plus other hero's and he'll probably some villains) just seems so idiotic. Plus the villan is an SJW proporganda machine, and it's hilarious.(OKAY MAJOR SPOLIER IN 3 2 1 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) When Killomonger dies at the hand of The black Panther he goes to see the sunset over wakanda and it's a pretty cool scene... until Killomonger opened his bloody mouth. He said, and I quote ""Throw my body in the ocean, so I can join my ancestors who jumped off the boat instead of becoming slaves"" and at the part I died laughing so did my two friends and a couple other people. They ruined my favorite shot in the movie with dumb political commentary. The action is meh. Whenever Black Panther is fighting anyone you never feel tension because he is virtually invincible. Not even kidding he took bullets to his head while in his suit and kept running like it was nothing. While on the subject of action the violence was so toned down for that PG-13 rating. At the end of the movie, Killomonger slits a soilders throught, and while there was a close up on her kneck, there wasn't a single drop of blood. It was honestly hilarious. Any ways I can't believe that people were threatened with violence because of their opinion of this movie. There is nothing special about this movie that could change the world or anything like that. The only chievement is that it was the record for the largest grossing movie directed by a black director whic is pretty awesome. The problem with this movie is that could've been something great. So this a below average movie in my opinion."
BLACK PANTHER,1 August 2018,7/10,Very good film pure escapeism would recomend to anyone
BLACK PANTHER,25 August 2018,,It's all executed terribly. The beautiful and colorful production design is ruined by terrible CGI and bland cinematography. The actors don't seem like they care about the movie and everyone lacks charisma. The main character is just way too boring and bland in this movie. The action is good sometimes and sometimes it's mediocre but there's very few action scenes. There's just a bunch of scenes of boring characters giving out exposition. The script is fine but everything is executed in a boring and unexciting way. This was the first time I fell asleep in a movie in 10 years.
BLACK PANTHER,6 August 2018,6/10,"So, don't kid yourself - every film has some political perspective. But then there are films with a political agenda. As just cool visuals and fight scenes, this film is okay. The problem is that the writers/director don't trust that you are bright enough to get the underlying political message, so they blast it at you. Hmmmmm...from out of nowhere comes the evil , vicious contender to lead the nation by using military force and and adherence to a nationalistic philosophy? Hmmmm...a nation that does not want to let outsiders contaminate the fabric of their society? Then, just as a story, the whole thing is preposterous - they have a gazillion tons of what must be a radioactive rock, but no one has found them because they are covered by trees.The only saving grace of this movie is that they did not find a way to get Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L Jackson or The Rock in it."
BLACK PANTHER,16 August 2018,7/10,"I was scrolling down the user review page this day and noticed lot of hate towards this movie i dont know why they didnt like the movie me personally liked the movie a lot they respected the african culture showed on-screen and rituals and type of stuff they say this is an overrated movie i think that this was a fantastic movie for marvel.They should create more type of these movies.10/10 no,but 7.5/10 is the best you can give to this movie.great work marvel"
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,3/10,"Shallow characters, thuggish behavior and absurd story. Wakanda is supposed to be most advanced nation, but decides on their king based on physical strength, everyone yells and overreacts all the time like in soap opera, praise gods and live in rituals? They straight up assumed that African culture would not change with education and intellectual development. They are allegedly so progressive, but at the same time they praise warrior culture?. Also movie is proudly racists. It talks about fighting for and helping ""our own"" referring to race and mocking ""white boy"". Bottom line is story is absurd in so many ways, but it is also not helped by poor CGI, predictable cliche quotes and bad acting."
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,10/10,"BEST, MARVEL, FILM, EVER....

BLACK PANTHER,10 November 2018,3/10,"Way, WAY overrated. Mediocre at best. One of the worst comic/superhero movies I've seen. I just could not become interested in this movie. Ant man was better, by a mile."
BLACK PANTHER,23 November 2018,10/10,This movie.... I honestly have no words. It's so amazing the way it's promoting people of color and different cultures and I'm just in complete shock! Amazing movie is all I have to say
BLACK PANTHER,6 December 2018,1/10,Don't know why I watched that movie at first place it was complete nonsense there is nothing new to watch in that film
BLACK PANTHER,28 December 2018,2/10,"Besides the clear political undertones of the film, the way the film states that an African nation can be the top of global technology and social ladder, the film fails on a few key areas. Firstly, the acting is good but the basic story is rushed and filled with posturing from a few stars. The lead offers the viewer the best possible example of man in charge, to the point that it feels forced. The ending is clear from the start and the only good bit is how that was set up. The plot twist is very well done. Leading the viewer down one path to take them to the true destination. Very good. Once that's over with, it's cringe worthy and very predicable."
BLACK PANTHER,20 January 2019,5/10,I am a big fan of superhero films and I was told this film was great by a number of people. So going into the cinema to see this I had high hopes but I was left underwelmed the film was ok and if there wasn't so much hype around it maybe I would have enjoyed it more but for me it just seemed a bit stupid I mean the scene at the end wih the rhinos was bizarre and the dialogue was hard to understand throughout. Overall not a bad film but not sure what all the fuss is about.
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2019,1/10,"The movie is worst than Iron Man 2, the story line is like every Bollywood movie"
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,7/10,"Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2019,4/10,"A lot of effect, this is ok, but the movie isn't really good. I think, the worst marvel film i have ever seen..."
BLACK PANTHER,22 April 2019,1/10,"I literally fell asleep after half the movie..
The worse marvel movie ive seen.."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2019,5/10,"It was not a bad movie, but in my opinion it resolved too quickly. We found out main motive of the movie in first 20 minutes(that his father killed his brother and his son wants revenge), I think that that story should have been revealed slowly through the movie. Also fight scene at the end was too clasical( good guys defeated bad guys without a twist)."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,5/10,"The movie was just mediocre. It's ridiculously overrated, and everyone knows why at this point. The movie, just like a decent amount of other marvel movies, is predictable, boring, and bland. Lets start with some good things about the movie. The setup of Wakanda in the movie is just amazing. The detail, the environment, the costume design, and just everything about it is just great. This is the strongest thing about the movie. I also think that Chadwick does a phenomenal job with his acting, and you can feel his pain and anger, which is great. Now for the negatives. The movie is just boring. The pacing is odd, there's many scenes that I feel are just ridiculous, don't make sense, or just seem unnatural. Kilmonger's writing was awful, and made you feel barely any remorse for him, after going what he's been through. instead of seeming like an angry yet innocent person, looking to fix what he feels the wakandans (i dont know what you call them) caused, he comes off as just a forced, weak, and just bland villain. The movie seemed pretty robotic to me at points, which made it feel very unnatural, and ruined my enjoyment. It's just not that good. Lastly, the CGI in the movie was just outright garbage. I don't know what they did, but somehow between the trailers and the movie, the CGI looked worse. Adding that weird glowing purple armor made any fight scene involving T'Challa look like it was from an early 2010s video game. It looked so fake, and just so bad. Some other effects, mainly during the car scene were just bad. Considering the budget of the movie, compared to other movies like Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok, it just looks terrible, and unfinished. The movie is just overrated, bland, and way too long for its own good. There are way better marvel movies, and this is a movie going into the lower end of the marvel movie rankings. It's clear that most critic ratings were politically motivated, because otherwise this movie would not get such high ratings."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2019,10/10,"T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, faces the difficulties and hard decisions of ruling a thriving, but secret country. He must keep the treasures of Wakanda out of the wrong hands, while also fighting a possible challenger for his crown. He has the special abilities of the Black Panther, which gives him extra speed and strength. In addition to all of these challenges that he faces in his country, he is also tasked with deciding whether and how his country should help the other struggling Africans around the world.We are hardly started in ""Black Panther"", and we can already see that this movie stands aside from routine superhero movies. It stands aside from the movies that are churned out every year that focus on the intense action scenes that completely overshadow the entire plot, if there is one. Like DC's ""Man of Steel"", it is the real thing. Boseman insists on T'Challa's good heart, courage and determination, and on the challenges many people face around the world today.The movie starts off with a detailed flashback describing the history of Wakanda. It then comes back to the present and introduces us to the main characters: T'Challa, the future king of Wakanda, Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Nakia, T'Challa's ex-girlfriend. T'Challa is getting ready to be crowned king, and we see another flashback which ties in to a previous movie, ""Captain America: Civil War"". As this is happening, we are introduced to the villain, a young American man, and his partner. We then see the story of how T'Challa saves Wakanda, and in doing so, saves the world.Unlike most other similar movies, ""Black Panther"", gives vivid descriptions of all the characters, providing backstories that explain their actions and make viewers feel sympathetic towards both the hero and the villain. We see how the villain, Erik Killmonger, grew up, and the specific events that made him who he is now. In many other movies, the villain is a huge machine who goes around killing people just to cause chaos, but in this movie, Killmonger is human and does what he thinks is right.The same can be said for T'Challa. We see how he struggles to decide between what is morally right and what will help his people. He leads with his heart and relies on the advice his father gave him before he died. He is not perfect and makes many mistakes, but because of his determination, he makes things work out. He shows that he is a leader that his people can believe in.Also, unlike most other movies, ""Black Panther"" connects the events and problems of this fictional world to the problems of the world we live in today. As The New York Times describes, ""In its emphasis on black imagination, creation, and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of the past that was denied and a future that feels very present."" It is clear that the main problem in the film is not an evil villain looking to destroy the world, but a struggle to fix a world where no one is equal. At the core, it is a movie debating the best way to fix the discrimination that so many people face today, infused with action packed scenes, humor, and drama. On one hand, we have a man who has seen the struggles of the world firsthand, and on the other, we have a king who is desperately trying to learn but cannot possibly understand what everyone is going through. As the movie progresses, opinions change, and even though the solution presented is unrealistic and impossible in our world, it is still understood that we need to find some kind of a solution.""Black Panther"" is a movie unlike any other in its genre, with superior storytelling and a realistic plot, that changes how we think of superhero movies. I would recommend this for anyone who likes Marvel or DC movies, such as ""Wonder Woman"" or ""Spider-man"", and is looking for a new movie to satisfy their action packed tastes. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes movies focusing on real world problems and is looking for something similar, but different. ""Black Panther"" is a movie that anyone can enjoy, from kids to adults, no matter what they like."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2019,10/10,"See a lot of fake negative reviews written by some fake accounts that hate the movie giving it 1 or 2 stars rating just because for once you see a full cast of black people and whites dont like that. Whats even worse for whites is that in the movie the blacks are the tehcnologiccaly advanced people and the only white guy in the move plays the part/role that ussually the black guys have ( if you watched the movie, you know what i am talking about). Obviosult the fake accounts have been made to ""please"" some far right politician that wants to keep things the way thery are ( blacks and minorities are shit, white folks are the best).
Fake acocunts got better because they also pretend to analyze the movie and just give low rating for the actual film when the truth is that its amazing in every aspect and they hate it even more because its even worse for a white racist person to see that a film with black people can be so good so they try to criticize every aspect except the political message( when the truth is that tha's the thing they hate).
ALL I CAN SAY IS WATCH THE MOVIE AND APPRECIATE THE MANY POSITIVE MESSAGES ITS GIVING. ITS NOT JUST ENTERTAINING BUT ALSO EDUCATIVE.IM SORRY RACIST PEOPLE BUT TRUTH HURTS AND WE NOT ALL SO STUPID, WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY YOU HATING THIS MOVIE AND THATS WHY WE LOVE IT EVEN MORE."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2019,1/10,"This was such a confusing film. The first fifteen minutes I couldn't figure out what was going on. Then it morphed into a
Weak imitation of a James Bond movie. I liked the costumes, can't rate the actors because the directing and editing and writing
were horrible. Why did so many critics recommend this movie?"
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2019,1/10,"This movie is so bad I'm not sure where to begin. The acting, the storyline were way below average. I love marvel movies and am a comic book geek and am one of the few that actually read the Black Panther and have in my possession the original Marvel Black Panther comics. It's sad that the whole media manufacturer review process of this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 January 2021,1/10,They ruined my favourite character. No logic in the movie. F their pandering to the PC policy.
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2019,6/10,"Black Panther was released in January of 2018 and is the sixteenth film in the Marvel Comics film series that originated with Captain America: The First Avenger and has progressed through to Avengers: Endgame. I expected Black Panther to be a face paced action packed film with a countless amount of physical actions shots but ended up having a surprisingly slow to start to the film. In comparison to its predecessors in the Marvel series, I expected a great film but was let down and only got about fifty percent of what I had hoped the film would be.
Black Panther was written by Stan Lee, directed by Ryan Coogler, and produced by Kevin Feige being released in the United States by Marvel Studios. Chadwick Boseman played the main character T'Challa or better known as the Black Panther, and his rival Erik Killmonger who was also his cousin was played Michael B. Jordan. Throughout Black Panther, Killmonger and Black Panther had a disturbed complex human relationship because Black Panther's father T'Chaka played by John Kani abandoned Killmonger after his Uncle Zuri played by Forest Whitaker killed Killmonger's father.
The conflict between Black Panther and Killmonger was not immediately recognizable but became the focus of attention when Killmonger returned to Wakanda to challenge King T'Challa for the throne to rule over the five tribes of Wakanda. Another integral character throughout the film was General Okoye played by Danai Gurira who was the leader of the Dora Milaje Tribe who was responsible for the guarding and protection of Wakanda and the royal family.
During the film, it was very prevalent that a decent amount of the action sequences was set during the nighttime or indoors with dark and shadowy backgrounds and the slower paced shots were filmed in a bright and colorful setting. Being that the movie is titled Black Panther, I expected a darker scene setting but the amount of dimly lit scenes detracted from the overall colorfulness that Wakanda presented. Black Panther had a short timespan with the cutting speeds between the shots and utilized the parallel cut to bounce back and forth between the action scenes. This took place during the car chase scene alternating between the lab in Wakanda and the South Korean streets. The parallel cut was utilized during the flying towards the back half of the film. The longest cutting speed during the film was the slow-motion scene when Killmonger was watching the ship disappear with the killers of his father. The slow-motion aspect of the scene was important to show the abandonment of the young Wakandans child by his fellow Wakandans.
Overall Black Panther was a necessary part of the Marvel Film Universe, but it lacked the excitement and action pack sequences of the films in the series. Another downfall of Black Panther was the lack of explanation of how the berries and flowers gave him his powers. I am not a reader of comic books, and this could be why I did not understand the little nuances of the film."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2019,10/10,"Review : "" Black Panther ""
In mid February 2018 there is Marvel Studio's Afro-American superhero movie called Black Panther. The director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Fruitvale Station), along with actor Chadwick Boseman, black panther movie is in their hands to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the spiritual sequel to Captain America: Civil War (2015) and find the mysterious Wakanda.
Black superheroes were never afforded the same deification. During the tail end of black cinema's golden age, Wesley Snipes' early-aughts Blade trilogy flirted with pop immortality, but even that character's legend faded across the years. I sometimes wondered, and still do, if black superheroes were ever meant to endure in the mainstream, the truth of America being what it is, or if the recurring image of black valor was too much of an irritant to the illusion Hollywood needed to project, to protect.After the tragic events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa or Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his isolated and highly advanced nation of Wakanda where he takes his rightful place as king. Together with his younger, incredibly intelligent sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), his ex Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and the loyal Okoye (Danai Gurira), general of the female Dora Milaje, he prepares his kingship.
Hidden from the outside world, Wakanda is an Edenic wellspring of hyper-advanced technology that balances African tradition and history with modernity. The central question of the film is how Wakanda will use this power: will they continue to horde their wealth, or use it to bring justice to oppressed people around the world?
In the opening scene of Marvel's Black Panther, a little boy's voice says: ""Papa, tell me a story...of home"".It's a fitting way to start the film, since the movie is very much about home and the stories we tell about it.
Director Ryan Coogler's film is absolutely amazing. The costume and production design by Ruth Carter and Hannah Beachler, respectively, is gorgeous. The cinematography is stunning, featuring soaring landscapes, waterfall canyons, and city markets. All of these things make Black Panther a well-woven tapestry of sights, sounds, action and adventure that is sure to impress even the most staunch critics of comic book films.
What I loved about Black Panther is that it is so much more than average superhero movies.While there are still many negative issues about racism against blacks, they are taking the right steps by focusing primarily on the African-American problem in the United States. The Black Panther film, on the other hand, portrays African culture positively in the media environment in which it is ignored, and it talks about the importance of preserving culture and traditions in a changing world.we are also confronted by challenging themes about how to act social change.
There are also many strong female characters in this film, from Okoye ,Nakia, , and Shuri to the palace guard, and even some of the elders on the council. Women hold many places of power and influence in Wakandan society. This is a refreshing change from the norm, and Coogler represents these women not just as secondary characters but as strong ,essential,and important figures in this movie.
With its hard-hitting action scenes, superb-pacing, moments of comedy and drama, stunning visuals, and a soundtrack to match, Coogler puts his best foot forward with Black Panther .We cannot say Black Panther is suprising or innovative, being the umpteenth Marvel flick. It is however extremely well executed. Thanks to its original setting, strong acting and subtle, yet important social message, Black Panther will be especially remembered as the ""Afro-American superhero movie at Marvel"" .
Black Panther film is a must-see for any and all fans of superhero films and comic books ,especially fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), as well as anyone looking for strong, kick-ass female characters and a memorable villain."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2019,3/10,"I tried to watch the movie several times but just find it lacking in tension and interesting story or scenes. There is also a lack of good humor as compared with other Marvel movies. Each scene from beginning to at least half way through the movie is scripted with predictable and borrowed events that fall flat in execution. I gave it a 3 because it isn't a terrible movie, just a terrible action movie."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2019,10/10,"One of the greatest problems of the film industry is undoubtedly the lack of racial, sexual and gender diversity. This was evident in several recent moments, especially in the awards season when some campaigns appeared as #OscarSoWhite and #PayMeToo.
In this scenario, the world of comics came to the forefront and Marvel released, in 2018, box office and critical success Black Panther.
With an outnumbered black cast, as well as in the technical categories, as costume designer and in the soundtrack, Black Panther, based on Marvel's superhero comic book universe, brings the fight of the new king of Wakanda, a fictional country tucked away on the African continent, T'Challa, played by actor Chadwick Boseman, to protect his people and, of course, Vibranium technology from villain Ulysses Klaue and Killmonger.
The film also stars the Oscar-winning actress Lupita N'yong as the warrior and romantic interest of the king, Nakia. Interpreting Okoye, captain of the Dora Milaje, army of Wakanda, we have the great Danai Gurira, famous for his participation in TV series, The Walking Dead.
In the film, Ulysses tries to invade Wakanda to steal Vibranium technology, for which he relies on the other villain, Killmonger, masterfully interpreted by Michael B. Jordan, actor of Creed.
The theft of Vibranium - which occurs in the past, outside the screens - is a central point of the plot. The consequences of this act modify the lives of T'Challa and Killmonger and shake out Wakanda.
While seeking to defend his kingdom, T'Challa discovers that he is a cousin of Killmonger and this one challenges him to a fight where the throne of Wakanda is at stake. In the face of this, a civil war can destroy Wakanda and there is still time for the family plot of Killmonger and T'Challa.
The film broke down barriers to being nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, the first film nomination for a superhero movie. And as if that were not enough, he gave the two black women the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction, technical categories never before won by black women. It also took the statuette of the best Original Soundtrack.
Fans of superhero T'Challa await a sequel already confirmed by Marvel. It's more an industry film, but it's a great one. It gave us diversity, equality and excellent action scenes."
BLACK PANTHER,3 June 2019,9/10,"The historic, first of its kind, box office smash, Black Panther, has kept superhero fans at the edge of their seat; with excitement and it is safe to say, it did not disappoint. The 135-minute action-packed masterpiece directed by Ryan Coogler, featured an unparalleled cast led by Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther, and Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, along with many other actors who all played a part to set the bar high for what next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The Black Panther was nothing short of perfection. The movie is based on the Black Panther comic series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966. The comic book hero was first introduced to the cinematic universe in 2016, during the movie Captain America: Civil War. The Black Panther movie is based in the fictional country of Wakanda located in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country of Wakanda has been seen throughout the Marvel universe prior to the release of the film most famously in Iron Man 2. The combination of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) easter eggs and a first-ever black lead cast for a Marvel film, lead to high excitement for superhero fans, and it is safe to say, they were not disappointed.
The movie follows the cookie cutter plot sequence of virtually every Marvel movie with the Black Panther as the protagonist, and possibly the most power-driven and cold killing villain Erik Killmonger as the antagonist. Even with a similar plotline to the rest of the MCU, the Black Panther brings forth a interesting change that makes the movie worth watching.
The movie was packed with mind blowing and clean cut CGI effects that helped drive the futuristic and luxury aspects of Wakanda. These effects were most noticeable as the Wakandan airship flew directly into the sub-saharan tree line and straight into the beautiful city of Wakanda.
The Black Panther features an Oscar award-winning soundtrack that radiates a futuristic yet traditional African sound. The score features many influential figures in the rap scene such as Kendrick Lamar and Travis Scott. Songs like Opps with Vince Staples and Yugen Blakrok, bring out the otherwise hidden emotions in certain shots of the film. This is seen through the intense and fast pace feeling brought out in the car chase scene that takes place in the neon-lit streets of South Korea. Other scenes such as the battle between Killmonger and T'Challa or the resurrection of the Black Panther, will leave you with tears in your eyes and a broken heart. The young and talented director did an unbelievable job illustrating world problems such as poverty and social injustice, through fictional events in Wakanda.
The movie was eye-opening to many and is definitely something everyone should see in their lifetime. After seeing the film it is clear there is room for a sequel and countless opportunities for the hero to appear throughout the MCU. The Black Panther is a superhero movie for the ages that will have a hulk-like impact on the cinema universe and an even bigger impact on black culture in cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2020,9/10,"Chadwick Boseman's performance is incredibly down to earth, the cinematography is on point, Kilmonger is the possibly the best antagonist the franchise has to offer (sorry, Loki fans), and Ryan Coogler is the breath of fresh air the MCU desperately needs."
BLACK PANTHER,28 July 2019,10/10,ONE OF THE BEST MARVEL MOVIES YET!!! BRILLIANTLY MADE AND FULL OF FUN AND ACTION..
BLACK PANTHER,1 May 2018,4/10,"Ok I get it that some were not happy with this film, maybe I didn't analyze it the way most of you have but, I really enjoyed this movie and I am not always a fan of Sci-fi. After all its not ""Gone with The Wind"" here its just a super fictional film that was based on a comic book character. WOW is it that SERIOUS? Someone even mention the acting of the actress who played the Sister of the Black Panther, I thought her humor was spot on and really cool, I wouldn't think she was trying to be funny, She was cute and funny. Oh well, I am looking forward to Part 2 and all the great special affects I hope they bring back the Villian Michael B. Jordan."
BLACK PANTHER,3 September 2019,2/10,"This movie focused ti much on the African proudness and not on the superhero. It makes a man from new york with no fighting trainning than the streets. Fights against the king Who i assume has been trainning all his Life, and beats him and he becomes King un less than a week. Ridiculous what kind of story is that, what image are you giving of the super h√©roe. Black Panther IS a cool character but this is a Bad Movie"
BLACK PANTHER,9 September 2019,10/10,"Everything is perfect in this movie, will recomend to everyone who hasn't watched this yet"
BLACK PANTHER,11 October 2019,1/10,Do not watch this film it does not meet to the standards of the hype made for this film.
BLACK PANTHER,7 November 2019,2/10,"Black Panther was maybe the best part of Civil War along with Spider-Man. He shared incredible fight scenes with Captain America and the Winter Soldier and I can't believe how little effort was put into the fight scenes. Really really disappointing.
I have no idea how this film has such a high rating."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"I was pretty disappointed in this one, I am usually a sucker for superhero flick. 
The gadgets/tech ideas were great, but it was downhill from there. While there were a few good acting performances, most were not which was very distracting from the movie. It was really what ruined the movie for me. It also wasn't a great storyline, I can handle that it was pretty predictable, it is a superhero movie. However, it just seemed basic. Just when you thought it might gaining traction and pull you into it, it would just fall flat.Basically, I rate movies by a couple of things:
Does it pull me in - No
Did it entertain me - sort of, I looked at my watch a couple times... and 
 I didn't have anywhere to go, but generally it did.
Would I buy the movie when it comes out on Blu-ray and would I spend the extra for 4K - no, I might stream as part of my plan, but I would not spend extra money for it....I wish I would have just waited for that option."
BLACK PANTHER,10 January 2020,3/10,"How this film won 3 oscars is beyond me. I've watched every MCU film ten times over maybe even more, but this one will not watch again after viewing once, totally boring. Most of the characters are unlikeable and the performances are dreadful do not waste your time. Very disappointed"
BLACK PANTHER,5 December 2019,7/10,"Really entertaining superhero movie, I was definetly not bored. Action packed and visually appealing with Wakanda as a sort of African Atlantis on earth. The cast speaks with an accent like Kenyan people, very charming. Also surprisingly political incorrect. I waited for Wakanda to realize that it was its duty to be invaded by poor immigrants but that never happened. The villain was filled with anger against whites and wanted revenge for the the slavery etc but he was defeated. The king/hero says immigration only brings problems and that his duty is to his Wakanda people, not the world. Had the Wakanda people been white, this movie would have been infamous and condemned by the libs."
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2021,9/10,I enjoy the way T'Challa was portrayed. He started of with not being much of a leader in the beginning but toward the end he was able to make his own decision.

Black Panther was Marvel's 18th movie, but its release in 2018 made film history. Not only is it ranked the best Marvel movie according to Rotten Tomatoes, beating out Avengers: Endgame (2019), Iron Man (2008) and Thor: Ragnarok (2018) but Black Panther is one of the most successful movies ever with an African- American director and also a predominantly black cast. Other movies with a predominantly black cast include Moonlight (2016), Get Out (2017), and Love & Basketball (2000) but none have received the attention like Black Panther.The film opens with a narration about how the nation of Wakanda came to be and why they have isolated themselves from the rest of the world. Wakanda is a fictional African nation known for its connection and source of vibranium and advanced technology. Many nations are trying to steal these resources from Wakanda so they live under an invisible shield.T'Challa, the main character in Black Panther, lost his father in the movie Captain America: Civil War which means that he is next in line to become king of Wakanda and the new Black Panther. T'Challa now has to protect his people. He battles powerful enemies around the world with help from his people and their allies. The film is packed with fighting, love, honor, and family.The plot deals with very strong and compelling themes including the role of women in the world, self-determination, and being African vs. being an ""outsider"". These themes are woven throughout the film and provoke the audience to think about these issues on a broader scale as they apply to our current society.Black Panther also had an outstanding original soundtrack. All of the music in the film was composed by Ludwig Gogansson. Before the movie, he traveled to Africa to learn and research traditional Tribal music. The pieces that he put together created a very powerful soundtrack that went on to win Best Original Score at the 2018 Academy Awards and a GrammyAwards. Kendrick Lamar also created an album for this movie. His song ""King's Dead"" also won a Grammy. All of the original music written for this movie enhances the audience's experience, and it transports them to feeling like they are surrounded in the culture and at the battle scenes.Another phenomenal part of this movie was the elaborate costume design by Ruth E. Carter and the beautiful make-up designs by Joel Harlow. There was a strict color palette of black, red, and green between the three main characters which often represent African nations. All of the dresses, crowns, and robes she designed were directly inspired by traditional African clothing. Joel Harlow spent hours researching traditional looks from African tribes. After that he had to create five different styles for the five different tribes of Wakanda. Harlow had intense detail on the characters including attaching individual scars all over Michael B. Jordan. Both the makeup and costumes were so important to the movie's impact because it transports the audience to feel as if it truly could have been filmed in a real nation in Africa.The one critique that I have about the film is the actor's accents. I fully understand the purpose was to create a more authentic feel for the setting. However, I believe at times during the story it was distracting and made me lose track of the dialog between characters.Overall, I would 100% recommend this film to anyone who loves a fast paced storyline with relatable characters. Despite Black Panther being a favorite Marvel movie among Superhero fans, I think it's biggest impact besides being highly entertaining is that it forces the viewer to think about gender and race in a new way."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,1/10,"People just WANT to like this film, but it's actually rubbish. Shame."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2020,3/10,"Sorry but the whole family found this really boring. Was such a surprise after the box office records and Oscars.
Glad to find a place where people have put honest reviews as the critics reviews don't make sense.I thought the acting was good and cinematography impressive but I believe the storyline was slow, predictable and lacked depth. The attempted humour was awkward and out of place.I probably felt it was one of the least enjoyable Marvel movies I had seen."
BLACK PANTHER,7 September 2018,6/10,Maybe I've watched too many movies in this genre. But the plot and 'twists' were basically predictable from the few few minutes and the movie had so many cliches it was hard to watch with a straight face.
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,9/10,"I had to see BP twice because the initial watch was a first row fiasco lol! The second time was a charm.
1) Solid story line with backstory of T'Challa, his family, people and power source.
2) The women ROCKED! as scientists, warriors, matriarchs, fashionistas.
3) The good vs evil aspect typical of comic books, wrapped up all loose ends.
4) Visually attention-getting action scenes and fighting
5) Messages aimed at children (help others, respect traditions, do your best etc.) were there but not preachy.
Adding more humor/laughs would have made things more entertaining. Maybe next time?
Peace-"
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2020,3/10,"Incoherent story and characters. Mix idealized African culture with American street culture, a strange James Bond like Q character, tapping out of a hold over a water fall like an American wrestler, and racial justice tidbits thrown in that have nothing to
do with the story, and you have a disaster of a movie. Now let's add in the bad acting, bad special effects, chaotic fight scenes, and lack of character building and I really wished I had spent my 2 hours watching the last episode of West Word, twice."
BLACK PANTHER,15 August 2020,10/10,Movie is good but i think chadwick boseman make it great by playing T'chala the blank panther.
BLACK PANTHER,17 September 2018,1/10,"This has to be the most ridiculous rating on here? Doesn't make any sense at all and i'm still to hear from a real person that rates this.Poor plot, poor acting, poor action, poor CGI, poor me for wasting two hours of my life on this crap. Do your landry, sort your socks, clean your toilet with your toothbrush... All activities that provide more fun than this. Love Marvel but this movie is rubbish."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,9/10,"Great visuals, great acting, great story. I would have liked more action, but I get them developing characters, and the story line that most viewers were not familiar with. I rank it third all time on my comic book films, right behind the original Batman and the first Iron Man"
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2020,10/10,"It was a bloody good film, in fact it was fantastic in all aspects regardless of what that smelly inbred James McLarnon has it say about it as he is tasteless and tacky."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2021,1/10,"Quite possibly the worst Marvel movie in the entire Ifinity War series. No small feat in itself, keeping in mind there are 20+ movies on that list.I was super excited going into the movie (based on how Black Panther was shaped in the Civil War film), but all that went away rather quickly. The Black Panther character felt so wise and intelligent in that feature film; here where he should shine looked nothing like the guy that recognised the destructive force and pointless violence that comes from vengeance.Poorly designed characters, the action seems pointless and the CGI overused (I especially hated the ""hey, you can now hide the helmet whenever you like"", I really don't see the point, towards the end when the two Panthers keep showing their faces briefly as to remid us who is actually who).I really don't see how this won three Oscars, nor how the critic reviews were ao overwhelmingly describing this as a marvel (pun intended). Maybe it's all become very political.All in all, there was massive potential for this story; too bad it feels like what could have been easily a part one and two butchered and patched together to fit in in just under two hours of screen time."
BLACK PANTHER,22 December 2020,10/10,"Honestly, by the comments written, you can tell these are people that had nothing to with their life and decided to make fun of one of the most best movies ever made. This is a great representation for young black people to look up to Chadwick Boseman and you can obviously tell they were just scared of the succession of the movie and tried to bring it down. Chadwick Boseman deserves ALL the hype"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"First and foremost, I normally pass on superhero movies. Most are too corny and childish for this engineer. Therefore I had my reservations about Black Panther. But, I love Africa and wanted to see how well a film set their would be executed. On that aspect alone, I saw the film February 16.I was blown away. It, like most things on the continent, exceeded my expectations. The directing, writing, cinematography, music, art, photography, sets and wardrobe were on a level that few science fiction movies achieve these days. Simply stunning! Jaw dropping!I travel extensively around the world and am quite fascinated by the beautiful culture and nature found on the African continent. The movie was true to it's root, too African cultures and I felt like I was back on the continent. The producers pulled it off -- a legitimate portrayal of the behavior in different cultural groups in Africa. If you are a person who appreciates the beauty of the birthplace of man, of African culture and life itself, you will be on cloud nine at the end. If you don't, you will likely be confused by it and many other things that make life great.Black Panther is Phenomenal! It was even better when I returned for a second watch. I'll likely make a third watch this weekend. All of this is amazing because I rarely watch movies and TV (far too much junk). This is long overdue breath of fresh air and creativity in film production! Long live Black Panther! (Thanks Marvel for restoring my faith in the superhero genre)"
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,1/10,It was honestly horrible. I would have rather watched forest gumbo 50 times in a row. Than this once.
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,10/10,The best movie to watch on the history of movies I highly recommend to watch in free time.
BLACK PANTHER,30 August 2020,10/10,"One of my favourite films.
great storyline, never a dull moment, Chad is fantastic as black panther. Highly recommend üåü üåü ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 10 stars"
BLACK PANTHER,23 October 2020,6/10,"I loved Black Panther back in civil war, he was a good character because he made mistakes, learned from them, and he had consequences. I loved him here too. He was probably the best part of the movie. But I can't say anything about the rest of it. It was really boring in my opinion, and I really tried to like it too. The villain was bland, Shuri was annoying, the villain had awful motives, the movie was overall really disappointing."
BLACK PANTHER,27 December 2020,10/10,"Black Panther is one of my favorite movies of all time, great story line with some of my favorite actors, I found it very funny and engaging throughout!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 September 2020,9/10,"I want to say that i liked this so much! many people say different opinions and it can exist. so my opinion on this film is great. love this crew of actors a lot. if you like actions and interesting plot then you you will like it!
i saw many gripping movies and this is not an exception. there is many fantastic things in the movie but they had an awesome place. bet i don't lie! i will give you an advice: you should watch it with your friends or family because everyone will love it üòç) go and check it out‚úåüèº"
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2020,1/10,Incredibly bad parody of American movie making and African culture.
BLACK PANTHER,9 October 2020,1/10,"The special effects in this movie were so bad, I actually had to stop watching because I began feeling so sick. From what I was able to watch, all the humor felt like it was trying way to hard to connect with a younger audience (that includes me) and so it just came off as cringey.The characters in Troll 2 had more depth than the ones in this movie. Black Panther is a goodie two shoes who faces zero moral conflict. His sister is a teenager who is super moody. The villain was a bad person. See how easy it is to describe these characters. I also find it funny how I can't remember their names despite them being main characters.In short, I have zero idea why this movie was a success and was so popular. If I had to put this in my MCU rankings, I'd put it second to last, above none other than Captain Marvel"
BLACK PANTHER,31 October 2020,10/10,"One of the best movie I ever watched!
Fantastic cast and the pictures were incredible.
I watched the movie a while ago and I still can't get over it!
Rip Chadwick Boseman You will forever be remembered:)"
BLACK PANTHER,6 November 2020,9/10,"From a homegrown South African, this movie got me right in the feels. Absolutely loved it. I felt the movie was a weird combination of the Hobbit, Star Wars and James Bond, but it worked! The characters were great and they got their Xhosa and Afrikaans accents spot on (well done Andy Serkis, many Hollywood actors have got it wrong before)."
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2020,1/10,One of the most overrated movies of the 21st cent.
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2021,7/10,"This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here."
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2021,7/10,"Black Panther was the best since it came out and we watch it every so often just for the visuals and vibe. I love that they had Oakland as the backdrop also, I felt the deep connection to the storyline and message. The King may Perish, but the Kingdom is eternal. Wakanda forever!!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 January 2021,9/10,The further time I watched this I didn't really like it but recently I watched it again and realised its actually an amazing film would recommend you watch it
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2021,7/10,A good one of the marvel films. The actors are good.
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2021,10/10,Maybe the most excellent movie by Marvel. I enjoyed watching it. The message that movie is delivering is so powerful. Everyone preparing for a fight in life should watch.
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2021,10/10,"After the tragic death of Chadwick, had thought about watching his movies and this one comes to my mind. This review is my tribute to Chadwick.This is one of my most favorite films in MCU. This is one of the best films in MCU when it comes to storytelling. The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world, but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process.
Black Panther is a fine stand-alone action drama that deals with the consequences of a modern civilization made possible by widespread colonization."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,5/10,"It's probably the most disappointing superhero movie I ever saw. The acting is subpar, jokes are awful and most of the lines are said in an overexcited, often cringey manner, that honestly made me sink in my chair.
Long story short, it's worst than Green Lantern."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2021,8/10,"Many of people in US are don't like this movie because they don't want digging their shameful history. Many of African American people are still live like slave in prison these days.They just want to say bad things to this movie. We shouldn't listen them, because we aren't American."
BLACK PANTHER,29 May 2021,10/10,It will keep you busy till the end and thriller. It will keep you busy till the end and thriller.
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2019,1/10,"Interesting propaganda for the alt-right, but not groundbreaking. Where Wallace, String?"
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2021,10/10,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM IS AMAZING...REALLY ONLY A 7.3 THIS IS A 10 and if people don't agree fully with me at least a high 9.
BLACK PANTHER,6 July 2021,9/10,Kendrick made the rating go up. The movie was also really good.
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2021,8/10,Chadwick Boseman lade such a message to the community with this movie that we all in some way got affected by. His previous movies and this are all a very inspiring and he is so good at imitating the character or person he should in the film. Black Panther is one of the best Marvel movies because of its content and message! Wakanda Forever!!
BLACK PANTHER,4 September 2021,1/10,"Basic story, how is this rated higher than endgame and infinty war on rotten tomatoes."
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2021,9/10,"Centuries before the reign of King T'Challa, there were five African tribes at war with one another over the strongest metal in the universe. The first warrior ingests this metal giving him super-human powers, which he uses to unite all but one of the tribes who refused to accept peace. This newly formed truce between the four tribes creates the land known as Wakanda. An agreeance is made to isolate the country from the rest of the world and use the vibranium to advance their nation far more ahead of any other civilization and became a technological superpower but hid it from the world making it seem like a third-world country. Following this the storyline flashes back in time to 1992 when the father of T'Challa, King T'Chaka pays a visit to his brother in California where he accuses him of helping an arms dealer gain possession of the vibranium.Present day, T'Challa is to be crowned king following the death of his father. At the crowning ceremony one of the fellow tribes leaders challenges T'Challa for the throne in the ceremonial dual. T'Challa ends up winning up sparing the tribe leader M'Baku with his life saying it would be better to yield than to die in combat. Following this the movie shows nemesis Klaue and an American Erik Stevens, otherwise known as Killmonger, stealing a Wakandan artifact made of vibranium from a museum. After being begged by his family members and lover to bring back Klaue to Wakanda dead or alive for prosecution, because they know that Klaue is going to sell the artifact. After traveling to South Korea in plans to stop the transaction from happening, they discover that the buyer is a CIA agent, Everett Ross. Having their cover being blown a firefight ensues as Klaue attempts to escape but is stopped by T'Challa, and is forced to hand over custody to Agent Ross. In custody Klaue gets broken out by Killmonger while severely hurting Agent Ross, leaving T'Challa no choice to utilize the nations superior medical facilities to save his life.While T'Challa's sister Shuri heals he confronts his mother trying to discover the truth behind the mysterious Killmonger. After learning that his uncle had betrayed the family and had to be killed because of it, the pieces are put together that Killmonger is in fact T'Challa's cousin. Soon after Killmonger returns to Wakanda presenting the body of Klaue and is demanding for a spot at the throne. The ceremonial dual ends with Killmonger throwing T'Challa over the waterfall the battle takes place at, and shortly thereafter takes total control of power and ingests the magical heart-shaped herb that gives him the power of the Black Panther. Once in power he orders that the garden of those herbs to be incinerated and begin to distribute shipments of the nations vibranium around the world. While Killmonger is having a power craze, T'Challa's family and Agent Ross flee to the neighboring tribe to find T'Challa unconscious. T'Challa's mother having being the one to burn the plants had stole one last plant before they were all destroyed and had fed it to T'Challa to revive him. With the power of the Black Panther now with T'Challa he returns to defend his nation and gain his throne back. The dual ensues with T'Challa winning by stabbing Killmonger, where he refuses treatment saying he would rather die a free man then live in prison. Following the demise of Killmonger, T'Challa returns to California to set up an outreach program, as well as face the United Nations to announce the nations true identity as the technological superpower that they are.A big strength in my opinion is that Black Panther is a movie from one of the most notoriously famous movie franchises, Marvel Comics. For Marvel movies they are situated in two separate patterns to watch the movies; you can watch them in order of chronological premier release date or by the sequence of events from the comic books. For Black Panther it had been mentioned in other action hero movies before the actual movie had been released giving viewers a teaser as to what to expect. Black Panther had been mentioned slightly in the renown movies Iron Man 2 and the 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron but did not make an impact with Marvel fans until the 2016 Captain America: Civil War, in which Black Panther made his debut. The importance of this is that Marvel had known that they wanted to create a movie highlighting Black Panther, so they had previewed the background information that is important to know before watching it. The two movies that Black Panther and its ideas were featured in help develop the storyline as it is mysterious as to what this forbidden place is like and what it contains within, and this information is explained within the movie. Being a fan of the Marvel movies that have watched all the movies in either of the two orders, when Black Panther had come out it had excited all the fans as they have been waiting for this. The movie has done so ell and been accepted by so many fans or not, the it has been nominated for roughly one hundred and thirteen different awards spanning the Academy Awards, American Music Awards, Grammy Awards. Golden Globe, Peoples Choice, and so many more.Additionally, another two strengths that this movie produced is the soundtrack towards it and the amount of effort put forth by director to respectfully culturally appropriate the movie. The soundtrack is produced and curated by Kendrick Lamar stands as another crowning aspect of the movie. After a trip to South Africa in 2015, Lamar gained inspiration from the motherland where the movie was taking place in. With the culturally diverse acting staff in mind Kendrick had decided to craft a cross-continent, soundtrack to match the feeling of the movie. The album was produced with a powerhouse group of artist with backgrounds of California slang, a certain South African dialect, American trap-inspired southern rappers, British soul, and pop vocals from Canada. By choosing this diverse of a group of artists allows the album to showcase its unity and diversity tying the movie together nicely. When Ryan Coogler had discovered that he was the director for the movie the California born made it apparent to travel to Africa to gain a grasp as to what he would be depicting onscreen. Traveling to and exploring Kenya and South Africa allowed Coogler to properly translate the culture onscreen. His efforts were seen evidently in the flawlessly executed costume wardrobe for the movie. The aspects of how the soundtrack album and the directors ability to appropriate the African culture and create Marvels first black superhero truly embodies and tie the movie events together perfectly."
BLACK PANTHER,10 October 2021,4/10,"Black Panther is like your average Marvel movie with the most generic plot and bad cinematography. The CGI in this show is extremely, take for example the last fight scene where the CGI is soo evident that it looks like we are watching a low-budget action film. The music score was pretty decent and the acting was pretty average. Overall this is an overly praised movie as the people are just praising the movie not because of the story but about it being the first superhero movie with a black person. Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with that sentiment but to act like this is the best movie representing the black community is pretty dumb as there were better movies like Moonlight and 12 years a slave which wasn't getting as much acknowledgment than Black Panther when it comes to a movie that represents the black community."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,6/10,"When you see the Marvel comic flipping through to start a movie, you get ready for a beast movie. Black Panther did not reach that level. The movie was very slow for a large part of it. They tried to give a lot of background and that's fine, but the problem was they ended up rushing through the good part of the movie because they spent too much time on pointless stuff. You have a nation that was ruled by generations of Kings from the same family this is great. So all the future kings grow up in the same nation. Wakanda is a very advanced, happy nation. The old king dies and the new king fights for his right to the throne against the one challenger and wins. Now the story completely gets turned upside down in what feels like 5 minutes. A young man shows up with a dead body of the man he killed in a bag, with an old sob story, a lip tattoo that is basically a passport that he could've used anytime in his life to get to wakanda, but chose to be a world wide killer instead and then shows up one day and basically becomes the new king in 1 day and launches the country in a civil war. Let's go through those again: a perfect society, a new king everyone knew and loved his entire life, gets removed in 1 day by some kid from Compton and the new king is respected and fought for even when the other king people thought was dead was still alive and never conceded. So they just threw out their laws to follow a new guy who just got there yesterday who was gonna lead them into world war and probably ruin their utopian society. I think the better story, which we've seen a thousand times (Thor for example), would have been two brothers who grew up in the same nation fighting for the crown or even extended Klaw's role in the story and made him the main villain who acquired vibranium and found a way to conquer Wakanda and expel the real king only to have the real king come back and destroy him. That would've made much more sense. The story they had for this movie just didn't hold water. Could've been so much better."
BLACK PANTHER,12 October 2018,3/10,Copying a lot of other movies . Has terrible CGI. Terrible villains and main actor has no presence. This is a money grab trying to get a black fanbase
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,9/10,"Great story well directed, a bit loud but that's how these things are nowadays.
Wonderful cast well into their rolls.
Recommend!"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,3/10,"Take Thor Ragnarok screenwrite, delete all the jokes and fun (literally there is 2 jokes in Pantera), and just inverse everones skin color. It most boring and clueless MCU movie. Action scenec are poorly filmed and choreographed. Main story is just bad. Acting are a wide range from total disaster to surprisingly solid. But the main flaw is that just a liberal game for a good public statement, and it doesn't feel good at all. For a clear picture - i am from a place where were no slaves, no one shipped everyone here. All the black, asian, other caucasian guys here come by they own free will and they are just another humans, no one care about skin color.
Despite it was filmed by a black guy, with a lot of a black guys in it is just feels like some one white producer want to make a public statement ""See, we DO care about! We made MCU movie with only black guys, who constantly killing other black guys who trying to kill every white people"". And it makes it more racially harassing and embarrassing."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,4/10,"A flop in the MCU. The movie was over hyped and didn't step up for me as the rest of the marvel movies. They had a great character and story which in my opinion could have done much better than giving us a poor origin story. However, the last 30 mins of the movie was good and they managed to make us sympathize with the bad guy, which was a nice move."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I've been impatiently waiting for ""Black Panther"" to be released. I was able to watch it today with two of my children and we all enjoyed it. I couldn't give a fat rats clacker about the hype. It was original and provided a very good background story of Black Panther. Thank you for a very enjoyable movie."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,10/10,Great movie. Those who didn't like it may not have understood or capable of relating to a predominately African American Cast with an African American SuperHero as they would other movies such as Superman vs Godzilla or Batman in Steel Magnolias. Believe the hype it's an excellent movie.
BLACK PANTHER,30 January 2019,8/10,"Is it just me or does it seem like a lot of the negative reviews are written by the same person? This movie is on par with other Marvel enterprises. They all follow the same, Save-the-Cat form. If you dig it (and don't have another agenda) you'll like this one."
BLACK PANTHER,27 April 2019,2/10,"Preachy movie in a ridiculous way, awful CGI, stiff acting for the most part, shallow character development.... pretty much what most of the other reviewers said.
Two stars: tribal costumes were awesome, but costumes are not enough to carry a movie."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,8/10,"Beautiful movie dealing with far bigger issues than just hero beating the enemy. None of the characters are as simple as they might appear. Dealing with modern era issues like accepting the mistakes of parents, the mortality of our civilasation, sustainable life. A good movie for a family experience and a tearjerker for those whom care.
(Spoilers ahead)
The issues were with predictability in the plot and the deus ex machina ending - allies whom were not supposed to help. And some fight scenes were dragging. Not the chase scenes - these were awesome. A great Marvel James Bond movie!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"This movie had everything. Action, great special effects, hardy laughs, and helps to start the growth of the MCU to further reaches of the universe. Don't let hate or prejudice dissuade you from seeing an incredible film."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"I love a good black superhero film as much as the next person (Blade was amazing) lately Marvel films have not been as good since the Disney take over but this really takes the case. Too much has been made of it by SJW's claiming that if your white you inherently will give this film a bad review, people accusing me of being racist if I don't like a crap film will not force me to like it. As I have stated I like a wide variety of films starring black actors as a matter of fact lots of my favorite actors are black I could go on about Jamie Foxx's performance as Django as he was simply superb however this review is about this ""movie"" which was not superb in anyway. Everything about it was bland, generic and design to appeal to people who would rather make it a big political issue and start more animosity with white people, personally I think these politics should be kept out of it because a film should be about whether it entertains or not, back to Blade again where this film is just about the politics of you must like this or your racist this never happened with Blade he was universally loved by both Black and White people in effect this has undone a lot of the hard work films such as Blade did by ramming politics down your throat and has in effect been nothing but a racist film towards non blacks. In defense of the people actually involved with this film I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was not there intention and that all the crap with the SJW's comes from there inability to actually engage what little intelligence they have, I would also state that the Black community have also been forced into the middle of this by the SJW's because most Black people don't want to force being black as being and issue it's usually white middle class morons chucking tantrums as they obviously did not get enough cuddles when they were children. Although I did not enjoy this film at all I still wish the cast and crew the best of look and hope that in the future they produce a good film."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"As a marvel fan who began reading comics in the early 1970's, Black Panther was a name I had known for decades but even at this high point was a minor character, but like Captain America, whom I had little interest in, my interest in both characters changed following the movies. With that reason and T'Challa's presence in Civil War, I had very high hopes for this movie... The good: the cast is charismatic and works well together in most cases, even Boseman's delivery as he grapples with his move to king works well. The near break-out character is his sister, who is easily the most animated and gets the best lines in the movie. Vistas of Africa and inside the Wakanda capital are impressive and great eye-candy for a time. A thematic plea that we are all more alike than different and should be better people is present which frankly we all need more, which brings the films worst failing - more on that later. The bad: actors clearly were locked into roles without much input, the feel in most cases was very wooden at times, even Boseman which is a shame as his extra dimensions in Civil War helped put it over the top. The set designs are good, but the CGI is rough by current standards, and in typical Marvel budget much of the fighting is at night, to reduce costs, a real shame as Black Panther looked awesome in full daylight combat in Civil War. The story as many have noted is just rote... but hey, it IS a Marvel movie so...The ugly: for a film that purports to make a statement about moving to one human tribe, it is unconscionable that the two main white characters are portrayed as either evil post-colonial opportunists, or at best a stumbling federal agent who is so out of touch despite his connections to the events of Civil War that he is just dumbstruck and unable to comprehend quickly the state of Wakanda. Two light anti-white racial pejoratives were thrown around, which undermines the movies message of moving forward and not grouping people and making assumptions or unfair associations. At its simplest, Black Panther is a very routine Marvel origin movie, overlayed with a well thought out sociological black diaspora politic analysis it all with a nod towards greater unity and an ascendant Africa, which makes its willingness to allow and in effect condone anti-white stereotyping all the more annoying. See it for the overall message, and be willing to realize that like society in general, it's not quite as advanced as it thinks it is."
BLACK PANTHER,24 July 2018,8/10,"I thought it was really well done. Some of the CGI is a little wonky, but the characters, their chemistry, and the story ultimately make up for it. Definitely worth checking out."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"I went into the movie with reasonable expectations, but feared that the 98% RT score was fabricated. As many user reviews point out, my fear was realized as I truly believe critics fear giving a truthful rating due to the BS backlash they'd receive from the social media warriors of today. The action in the film was cool as was all the tech stuff, but the story was lacking. The villain of the film could have been better too. I think this movie could have benefited by connecting it more to the MCU - perhaps having a secondary hero like Bucky, or any applicable ones from Civil War play a role in this films plot. I understand there was a heavy political message behind the film, which is great, but in terms of a super hero movie, I felt this was the worst BY FAR at least in terms of the MCU."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,10/10,"I loved Black Panther enough to see it three times. I'm just not feeling the alleged ""disappointment."" It almost sounds like the people who gave this movie low ratings, but love other MARVEL classics were expecting something that would give them a #10 rating high. I'm sorry but I have to ask myself if all of these ""Hated Its"" were people who thought they were going to see some badass MFs punch out some other BadAsses--preferably in a rundown hood, using some MF-ing lame Black slang so they could use it next time they were with one of their homies. In other words, are you all White? Angry? Hating life in general? Having deep feelings of inadequacy? Hoping to see at least an hour of the movie devoted to some Black folks kill some other Black folks using some vile, horrendous MO? I can see why you think you were ripped off.Seriously, what exactly were you looking for? Did you want to really experience the RIDE on Wakanda transit? Most theaters have those motion chairs in the lobby. Maybe you should have stayed there. Were you expecting more rap music in the BG over-riding dialogue? 'Cause who needs characters talking, right?Were you offended by the handful of realistic statements referring to ""colonizers"" for example? Jealous of Shuri, the girl genius? Couldn't remember which one was Shuri or and which one was Zuri? Liked Angela Bassett better as Tina Turner? Disappointed?Oh, oh, ooh, I got it! You can't ""pronounce"" them damned African names. That's it, right? And the whole story line caused you to think too much. You are ""disappointed"" because the three Black people you know in real life are daft and would never speak in complete sentences.That was what made it so unrealistic, eh? Did you not understand the Xhosa language spoken for all of three minutes out of two hours and 14 minutes? Maybe the subtitles threw you off because you are an illiterate ignint? No, no, don't tell me! You are pissed off because you actually believe there is truth in the plot line and Africans are hoarding the most precious metal on earth. God save the Queen! And if there is, WTF. No that can't be it.I truly believe you went with parallel universe expectations and instead you actually had to pay attention to a movie with a message as well as real character and plot development, extremely clever lines, A+ acting talent, expert directing, panoramic beauty, and style. What a concept. Just not enough clashing and banging of shields and buzzy weapons fer ya.If you're a pothead, you either enjoyed it immensely (but probably should see it again ) or you just couldn't follow it because you did the Cherry Pie instead of the Purple Kush or worse, you mixed them. Dummy.And Lordy, you didn't recognize the music. Oh God forbid, y'all had to actually LEARN something from a MARVEL movie.ICYMI, there was a message here. You probably need to see it again to un-disappoint yourself. As always, PEACE IN."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,1/10,I hate this movie; What a waste of time and money. The only saving grace was the popcorn... Don't see this!
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,3/10,"No plot, no actors, moderate visuals.
Give me my money back."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,I felt this film would be good but the soulfulness and presentation were really amazing. The CGI was outstanding in most every scene and the storytelling was well done. This movie really sets itself apart. I truly enjoyed it
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,5/10,I am an 8 years member of IMDB with 800 ratings. this is the first time I wrote a review. but it was only because the film was such a disappointment. the plot is astonishingly empty with stupid holes all the time. the characters are simple and na√Øve. actions are nothing original. even the bonus scenes are incredibly boring. can't believe it's a Marvel creation. it makes me wonder if Avengers 3 is worth watching at all. 5 stars are only for the good looking characters. I don't know how much they paid to get this ratings on IMDB but I do know the film critics are definitely not speaking the truth.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"First let me say that from a philosophical standpoint, this was Marvel's best movie hands down. The argument as to whether a nation as powerful as Wakanda has the right to remain an isolationist nation; or the moral obligation to help those other struggling nations around them was very thought provoking. The movie was very well acted with Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger being the standout in the cast.  The action and special affects were top flight.. It had just the right amount of humor so as to add levity to film without turning it into a complete comedy like most Marvel films tend to do. I will likely be going to see this once more at the theater and it will definitely be added to the dvd collection as soon as it drops."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,"The latest Marvel comic-book inspired blockbuster did live up to the inevitable hype despite the wafer-thin storyline. It is a superhero film and therefore should be judged on this merit. The acting performances were all very solid despite the perceived weakness of the plot. The highlights were the comic one-liners delivered expertly by Shuri (Letitia Wright) and M'Baku (Winston Duke) which were peppered delightfully throughout 2h 14 min feature. This film should be normal but it isn't. Therefore, you cannot underestimate the symbolism of having a predominately black cast doing what action heroes do on the big screen. It was a great sight to see. Hopefully, this provides the platform for some of the film's stars to get some more leading roles."
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,1/10,I don't know what hype has been created for this movie but for all who still planning to watch just two words for this movie ... STAY AWAY
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"Great history and introduction to the Black Panther Super Hero! The timing for this movie is perfect and it has messages with hidden golden nugget. Watch this movie again in IMAX 3D to see from another creative angle. ""X"""
BLACK PANTHER,9 February 2019,1/10,"Too much black in this movie... It felt like a ghetto movie, with crimes and slang."
BLACK PANTHER,15 December 2018,1/10,I am finally getting around to watching this movie after it exploded into theatres back in February. I am so glad I didn't pay theatre prices to see this. The screenplay is terrible. The dialogue seems to be written by elementary school students. It's boring and there is no character development. It reminds me of Avatar. Shame on all the critics that have praised this and the organizations that have nominated it for awards.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2019,5/10,Complete waste of time. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
BLACK PANTHER,19 July 2018,1/10,"I believed the hype. Bad move. I will never watch a blacksploytation movie again. 
The plot-stunk
The acting-stunk
The script-stunk
The casting-stunk
The sets-stunk
All in all a pathetic waste of time"
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2019,1/10,This is the most overrated movie i have ever watched my entire life
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"I saw Black Panther during its opening weekend, and I really feel it was worth all the hype. It felt less like a super hero movie and more like a drama with story aplenty. It immerses you from the beginning, plunging you in to life for these characters in Wakanda, and makes you want to root for them from the opening scenes. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as both man about to become king and super hero Black Panther. The supporting cast are incredible and the special effects are awe inspiring. I would have to rate this as my second favorite in the whole Marvel Universe, after the first Guardians of the Galaxy-which tops my list mostly due to the extremely fun to watch cast. Definitely a must see!"
BLACK PANTHER,29 July 2018,9/10,"I simply loved it, such a different approach than the usual blockbuster. Apart from the first scene that in my opinion had to be re-filmed because of the bad acting the film was fantastic, well developed characters and imaginary world.I also loved the fact most of the actors where black finally we have some diversity in the film industry."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,8/10,To start one of the reasons this movie was so good to is due to the cast finally being mostly of a race other than white for a blockbuster this is not seen often. Yes the movie had many different directions but that's what made it different. I felt like they were trying to accommodate everyone in this movie which for some viewers made seem confusing. To end i feel this is more mature feel movie than a kids one.
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,1/10,"This was a political film to give a senseless black hero to appease black people. The result was a cringeworthy film with scenes strait out of all the other superhero films (and Star Wars) and the worst Mock African accents I have ever heard.
It is so embarrassing and an insult to the ethnic race."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2019,1/10,"It is even not good enough in Marvel film,
I'm so disappointed with this"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,"I read this movie is breaking records, but im disapointed after i saw it. New movies are bad. where the world is going?"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"Why did it get such a good review???? Seriously, the graphics were terrible, the humour attempted failed terribly."
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2018,9/10,Very interesting and I can't wait to watch Black Panther 2!
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,1/10,This is a highly overrated and over-hyped movie. Wait for this to come out on Netflix.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"The downfall of comic movies is obvious but I didn't expect they would reach the bottom so early.Boring, terrible action scenes, bad acting. It was so bad it made me register here and post a negative review. Seriously can't figure out why that movie has such a high score. Ridiculous."
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,1/10,Terribly bad and boring. I'm guessing the only reason this is rated so high is because of the blind fanboys and girls.
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,1/10,"I saw this movie ignoring all the reviews either good or bad. The first hour of this movie are incredibly boring and filled with action lacking scenes. The fights were your normal slightly super human fights were people get launched. A lot of time is wasted showing the ""advanced"" technology but still living in what looks like the slums. The bad guy is over-hyped and is later dumped for a new bad guy. Star wars anyone? The movie overall was pretty predictable. I only got excited when kill monger took control but even that was short lived and pretty corny in the end."
BLACK PANTHER,13 September 2018,10/10,I think this may be my favorite Marval stand-alone. Gorgeous women with beautiful accents that can kick some serious butt and build tech that would make Tony Stark jealous. Not to mention Shuri is hilarious! Incredible action scenes and a of course a very sexy Panther! Chadwick Boseman was made for this part!
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,8/10,"Ok I watched this and I have to say I enjoyed it. The acting is not wooden...that's how Africans talk for god's sake, and the accents, again they are africaAf and that's their accents. I thought the special effects and costume were brilliant and what I have come to expect from Marvel.Watch it and don't listen to the idiots that have reviewed it"
BLACK PANTHER,10 September 2018,2/10,"The movie is bad, jokes are bad, acting it's bad I don't know man, after first time I saw Black Panther on screen I was waiting for a solo movie with this guy but they just ruined it..."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,10/10,"I loved Black Panther. Everything about the film was fantastic from the visuals, the acting, the writing, casting, costumes, music etc. Everything worked cohesively. I haven't felt this excited about a superhero film since The Dark Knight (and yes I know that's a DC film). Black Panther had an authenticity and an engaging narrative as well as a complex and three dimensional villain, that I find most superhero films are lacking. Don't listen to all these other bogus ""reviews"". It's a gorgeous, entertaining film that is 100% worth seeing in the theater. More films like this please!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,6/10,For the budget provided for Marvel they could have made a proper movie....
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,6/10,"Just saw it in 3d dolby atmos, curve big screen, nice piece of audiovisual entertainment. The story line and the acting wasn't that great, just ok. I understand this movie is really political in the USA, but I don't really get why this is a black movie, and something for black people to be proud of. The movie is a thin fairytale in the fictitious African kingdom of Wakwanda, so not that weird the cast is African (looking). One of the messages in the film was that Africa was robbed empty by others. There's truth in that and nothing wrong with it being told once in a while. But on the other hand, this can be said about every continent on earth. the last centuries the westerners are the evil do-ers, for example I'm Dutch and the slave trade of the Western Indian Company was repulsive. But before the 17th century western Europe was peripheral, where was plundering and a place where people were made slave and taken away. What I want to say is, I don't really get this playing politics of Hollywood. I find it most of the time quite pretentious, embarrassing, arbitrary and mark missing. Concerning this particular movie, to me it wasn't that (bothering) political. This movie made me think of Avatar, the nice visuals and also somewhat story wise."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"I absolutely loved this movie. 
I really tried to keep an open mind before seeing it. I tuned out all the hype and reviews and judged for myself - I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! The plot, acting and action scenes were all great. 
Great work marvel!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,3/10,"I so wanted to like this film but it was so so poor, I actually fell asleep at some points. The problem was that the film trys to justify how a super nation in the heart of Africa is so technologically advanced than the rest of the world but they are hidden and keep them selves to themselves and why. Yet many of their people still live in mud huts or in the mountains living in caves! Its a small nation with spaceships that can fire lasers yet cannot hit a stationary target from 100m away. That in a fight scene in the middle of an open field, an army suddenly appears from behind a rock (I kid you not) to save the day.Had it been done tongue in cheek rather than trying to make the whole plot believable it could have been watchable. So, if you can stomach watching a power rangers episode with your kids then you can probably stomach Black Panther too."
BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,6/10,"I went to theaters expecting a lot since everyone was praising this movie, but what I got was a live action Lion King which lacks any depth and emotion. Not to say that there aren't emotional moments, but they just fail to hit one right in the feels.
Praiseworthy point is its cultural significance."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,"MCU is like entertainment cafe. When you enter , you expect only entertainment. As they are in progress the story is becoming the part of this cafe.Story in one linear- A price who will is going to be king faces a mission just after throne ceremony. but technically he has failed and returns to his kingdom.
and in that situation some mysterious man enters in to the state and claim for throne. 
So story does not have potential to make a grip. Even movie is lost in the end and as a viewer you know what will be the next but you just wait for finish. regarding performance , except two main male actor most of them do not do favour for the film.
Editing is very good, visual effects are not as expect in MCU. Music is the key of the movie which carry the story.
So I gave it 6 out of 10. (B1-Boring, B2-Better, B3-Best)"
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2020,2/10,"Not sure where the good rates are coming from. The story is boring and slow, it is a combination of all the Marvel stories happening in Africa."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,10/10,Don't listen to the racist ignorant losers out there. This is a great movie.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,It was boring and it had everything to do with the writing of the movie. I thought 1st Thor was horrible aswell but 2 better 3 was really good I really wanted the black panther to be awesome because I like the black panther but it fell very short. Three people were snoring one in front and two behind me.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"If you are you've done the due diligence to understand African culture you'll have no problem getting this.
This movie is the only Marvel movie deeply rooted in more fact than fiction. The Villain has an agenda very closely connected to the modern world and real historical events. His weaknesses and pain are very relatable and the conclusion actually happened in 1994 South Africa with Nelson Mandela, It is that realization that made me love it more, when fiction and imagination turn out to be as realistic as possible. 
The score is too incredible for words, the African drums come in at the perfect moment all the time and the resonance tugs at the strings of your consciousness and raises your heart rate to an intense but enjoyable level.Visually it is stunning how they got the costumes right and pulled from all African countries. This is the Lion King On Crack."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2020,10/10,It was so refreshing to see a great Superhero movie with a minority cast. I hope studios understand fans don't give a crap about Black and White Super Heroes!!! All we care about is great stories told by great directors and Awesome Actors. I'm a straight white male and I find Black Panther the greatest Superhero on screen. Then take awesome women actors like Birds of Prey and another freaking jackpot. I don't care about black or white. Man or woman just give a great action movie and I'll fork over plenty to watch great movies. Even Crazy Rich Asians were Awesome.!!!! Please more movies like these. I'm so ready for Disney+ new tv shows. We are starving for great tv and movies!
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,10/10,I loved watching a super hero strongly consider the moral repercussions of his actions in this movie. The only other film i can think of that does this inside or outside the MCU is the newest Spiderman.Iron Man and Captain America like to shoot-first-ask-questions-later and feel sad about the unintended destruction they caused while carrying out their mission. The drama in Black Panther is much more interesting because we see he and his family weigh the consequences of the actions they must take.Thor could learn a thing or two about what it means to be king.Great performances. Great costumes. Great production design.
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,1/10,"Not in the mood to write a huge review. Bottom line, it's just another superhero regurgitation - nothing new or special about it. No character buildup - just a bunch of senseless fighting and meaningless story line.I'm pretty sure that they paid like 25000 people to vote this a 10/10 - there is no way that many people actually like it that much. This is a flop."
BLACK PANTHER,25 August 2018,1/10,"The Lion King with real people and some science fiction. I can't believe peope are giving this 10/10.
The plot is so predictable and some of the scenes are so terrible acted that I started laughing."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"Everything about this movie was gorgeous. The sets and costumes, the script and music, the acting and direction. Everything was completely on point. I can't wait to watch it again.All the characters seemed remarkably three dimensional, including a villain who is probably the most actualized villainous character throughout the MCU. Hopefully this is a hint of what's yet to come from this filmmaker. We should be throwing as much money at him as we can so he can keep making magic like this."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,9/10,"I would say it was a good movie, i watched it twice. But Marvel repeated its history of bad quality not putting much needed effort in quality of the movie.
Trailer was very excellent but the movie was not upto the mark.
Marvel should try putting music in Action areas of the movie rather than keeping it empty and sounds of background-they are also important but they make it boring."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is a spectacular film. I would dare to say it is the best theatrical debut of the Marvel Universe thus far. I won't harp on about why I think the movie was great, as you all can see from the many honest reviews on here and on RT. So just get out there and enjoy it!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Here's the thing. The crux of most of this movie is the black experience told from various angles. If all you're interested in is fight sequences and cars blowing up, then this is not the movie for you. If you're interested in watching a story about abandonment, colonialism, nationalism, and other complex topics then this is the movie for you. If you are unfamiliar with the black experience and black culture then yes this movie may go over your head and you may view it as boring. I'm NOT saying this is only for black people, but to understand the essence of a complex movie like this you need to understand black culture and history. I won't even get started on talking about how impactful this movie is for young black people to see themselves as heroes and as the majority and not the minority on the big screen, I'll be typing a whole dissertation lol.The acting is pretty solid. Cinematography & wardrobe were fantastic. I really think the unsung hero is Winston Duke. He's got some great acting chops and a firm grasp on African mannerisms. I hope to see more of him soon. Other than that, it's a pretty solid movie and I'll probably see it again."
BLACK PANTHER,7 July 2018,1/10,"The storyline is poor and predictable, and the acting is not very good. No a good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,2/10,"So Black Panther isn't the skilled fighter from Civil War, he's just a guy in an massively advanced technological suit, who eats some kind of plant to get strength and agility? What is a super hero with no weaknesses? Boring."
BLACK PANTHER,31 March 2019,10/10,Best movie ever! Loved every action packed moment. So happy this character has finally made it to the big screen.
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,2/10,"Having seen this title with friends at the cinema we could not understand what the hype was about. Pretty typical Marvel movie, nothing unique other than the black cast.
The story tried to portray morals, but these were bad morals. The movie copied lots of famous titles like Casino Royale - there is a scene which is almost an identical copy, Avatar and more.Visual affects were decent at times.With regards to the story it tries to portray the advanced society where the main characters live as a modal society for the world to follow. However to any sensible person it's anything but that. It's filled with fighting and ritualistic murder (black on black) and feeds into negative stereotypes of thuggish behaviour. 
I went in with no expectations but still left disappointed. It's a long movie too."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2019,1/10,I'm still trying to understand why some people say this movie is great... it's not even average.
BLACK PANTHER,5 July 2018,2/10,TOTALT overrated movie!!! IMDb is usually right about movie scores. But someone has been tampering with the numbers on this one! The Green Lanthern deserves an Oscar as much as this deserves a 7.5.
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,"First off, Wakanda is a marvel. The people there are living in 2038 in terms of technology but ironically the world thinks it's a third world country. That sets the scene for the entire movie. The story is about how a young king seeks to right the wrongs of his father and his father before him. It's an intriguing story mixed with humor at just the right times. The music is fantastic and the costume is even more so. Great performances all around and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger) totally nailed it. He was amazing. Drinking in the marvel that is Wakanda coupled with the amazing stunts makes the whole movie kinda short. On the whole this is a solid 10 /10 movie and congrats to the whole cast and crew."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,10/10,If Avatar can be nominated for 9 oscars then this movie should be nominated in all categories or the Oscar really are too white. By far the best movie in years!
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,5/10,"Not the actors fault the whole storyline is so terrible.
The only highlight in the movie was Ulysses Klaue...and he died fairly early, shame. A storyline with only him would be fun.PS! Marvel, stop mashing up all the superheroes.
Tell us more stories from each and every one of the superheroes."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,3/10,"Who in this world can say this movie deserves a 10?
You can love a movie like, let's say, Darkman and you know it's not for a 10. Photography, music, script are not as good as you might want, but anyway you love it.
Black Panther is confusing, disordered and full of noise packed in a 2 hours film... Booooring!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 January 2019,5/10,Never will this movie be an Oscar caliber movie. Everything about this movie was recycled plotlines filled with clich√© scenes. This is an insult to the minority community. 7 Nominations for relieving their past guilt on missed worthy films.
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,10/10,"If you go into the theater expecting something other than a Marvel movie... You will be a bit dissapointed. This is a Marvel movie, a very cool and beautiful one at that. Go and see it."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"This is the best movie ever made by marvel. Ryan Coogler's masterful superhero drama is unlike any other, featuring outstanding acting, breathtaking art direction, fascinating royal intrigue, memorable action sequences, and surprising depth. It's that depth -- of character, of storyline, of relevancy -- that makes Black Panther shine, as Boseman's T'Challa takes the mantle of king with enormous uncertainty about whether to share Wakanda's resources with the world. With the exception of his second-in-command W'Kabi (Kaluuya), T'Challa surrounds himself with an inner circle of influential women: Okoye, Nakia, his mother (Bassett), and his genius younger sister, scientist/tech inventor Shuri (Letitia Wright). Each of them contributes much to the story, with Gurira's spear-wielding Okoye the movie's clear scene-stealer, Wright the clever comic relief, and Nyong'o offering a wee bit of romance. Even the central villain, as played by frequent Coogler collaborator Jordan, is well-rounded and humanized, with the actor doing great work opposite the equally nuanced Boseman.There's so much to appreciate in Black Panther, from its pulsing score, which features a soundtrack overseen by award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar, to the mesmerizing cinematography courtesy of DP Rachel Morrison, gorgeous tribal costumes, and vibrant production design. There's not as much laugh-aloud banter as viewers may have come to expect from Marvel movies, but the beats of humor that are here, usually thanks to plucky Shuri or mountain-tribe leader M'Baku (Winston Duke), are extra funny. Ultimately the film's success comes down to the thoughtful, compelling storytelling from director Coogler and writer Joe Robert Cole, as interpreted by a terrific cast of actors. This isn't just another highly entertaining but formulaic superhero story; it's also poignant and powerful and earns its place toward the top of Marvel's films. (Be sure to watch all the way through the credits for a couple of extra tidbits!)"
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2019,3/10,Boring. Just boring. Tried three times to watch this movie... fell asleep all three times
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,8/10,"For those who rated this movie below a five or expected something more, YOU MISSED IT. The movie is a segway to the Infinity Stone Saga. Rightfully the Infinity Stone on Earth is found in the cradle of civilization, Africa. Perhaps the movie could have had a better plot but it is the tech in the movie who is the star. When you see the Infinity War movie notice how much the new tech from Wakanda is used, bringing forth a new level or age of discovery."
BLACK PANTHER,10 July 2018,8/10,Very good movie despite the low reviews below. The movie has a great story and plot. It shows how humanity can use it roots and heart to make the world a better place were we can all live helping other people regardless their race.
BLACK PANTHER,29 June 2019,1/10,"Terrible in every way. Critics are scared to give bad reviews. The acting, the story, the cgi everything sucks in this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,3/10,"I went to find out why it's so popular. I still don't know. The plot made no sense. The special were fine, but, I gather, pretty standard for this type of comic book movie. The different geographic locales added some interest. My takeaway is that it's somehow wrong to put such enormous effort into a dumb and meaningless story."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,6/10,I think Black Panther in Civil War more cool than his solo film. There are no impressive actions scenes and main charachar not cool for a king in this film.
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2018,1/10,"I've never left a review before, but I felt the need to do so for this one. The rating, based on the content of the movie, has been artificially pumped by, what I can only assume, political activists. Now, before I get labeled as racist and bigoted, I am in no way leaning anywhere close to the extremes on the political spectrum. The movie is incredibly bad. Full of cliches, ridiculous situations so as to portray a world in which the roles would be reversed between the western nations and the less fortunate of our planet...terrible script, terrible acting...overall just an incredibly bad movie. I would argue it's the worst movie ever given the funding it had. I cannot say one good thing about this movie, other than the cool cgi and costumes, I guess. Please stop political activism in movies."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,10/10,"This movie was amazing! So many black issues dealt with in an important way from traditional vs. modern, black on black crime, difference between African American and Africans, division vs. unity in the black community, how to be a white ally, and much more. The jokes were funny, if you didn't laugh it's because you are most likely white and took the film too seriously. While the film was serious, it had comedic relief that was real and dealt with how whites have treated and still do treat blacks. If you were white, you're feelings would be hurt if you took it too serious. This film is about black excellence, hope, tradition, changes, Love, sadness, mistakes, slavery, fixing the past, and changing the future. While the world thinks Wakanda is a third world country, it's adtually the most advanced in the world! You hear that, an AFRICAN COUNTRY IS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE WORLD. More advanced than the United States which is majority white. And Africa would have been the most powerful continent in the world if it wasn't for those meddling Spanish and European colonizers. Darn it. Hate all you want, but Black Panther has broken records as the top selling movie and top selling marvel movie. So hate while we still win."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Despite hate groups trying to stage fights to scare people away, or giving low ratings on Rotten tomatoes, the audience ignored them and went to see this movie in droves. Hate could not keep people away.The Kings were regal, the women fierce, the story complex.In American schools, black kids are taught to be embarrassed or ashamed of their African-American ancestry. It takes years to be untaught such racism. This movie lifts them up and shows them as the proud, intelligent and strong people they are. Kids today now have something to make them feel proud of where they came from.One mistake in film: ""It's our time to be on top"" line should have been delivered as, ""Our time to be on top AGAIN,"" or ""Back on Top."" There was a time were they ruled the earth; even an African King was a Pharaoh."
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,9/10,This movie showed Africa in the different light. The director and writers incorporated a wide variety of cultures that can be found across the continent. I greatly appreciate what this film did for individuals of different races/ ethnicities.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"I went into this movie, with a lot of background excitement. Although not in Hong Kong particularly, the buzz of this movie on Twitter was one that was overwhelming to be honest. I think what I liked about the film in the beginning, is the way they connected T'Challa and T'Chaka in a deeper sense, when compared to the brief moment in Civil War. I think they truly gave Black Panther a good and proper origin, however it didn't feel like the one Dr Strange got in his own movie. This origin story, was more like experiencing T'Challa in depth after a brief and fast introduction in CA: Civil War.Why I felt this movie was the most relatable MCU Movie, is because of the customs and the attire. As an Indian, born and brought up in India, some dressing sense and ornaments felt very known to me. For example, T'Challa in one of his scenes wears a clothing item, very similar to the Kurta (Search Google, basically an Indian long garment). Also, some rituals were something that I could easily make sense of.After Loki, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger felt like a really great villain in the MCU. I won't be spoiling his story, but one has to experience him on their own to know what I mean. His scenes are to watch out for, you would be greatly influenced by his character.The women in this movie are a talking point on themselves,but two that caught my eyes were: Danai Gurira's Okoye and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Shuri, in particular, was one of favourite characters in the movie. Interestingly, Okoye and Shuri are two women in charge of defense and technological innovation respectively. I just felt, so happy that they portrayed both the physical and mental capabilities of the women. Saying any further will spoil the movie, so that's it.However, the only reason I will give it a 9, is because the approach towards the climax, for me, felt a bit over-stretched. Otherwise, an all and all amazing movie, with a lot of socio-political facts surrounding it, that will be talked by generations to come by.Hope this review was helpful.Dharya P."
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2019,1/10,"Interesting start, then drowned in dumb person violence. Too bad. Could have been fun, maybe even moving, if they hadn't succumbed to the LCD of movie making."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,4/10,"""Black Panther"" is an action-packed origin story with an interesting character development. However, it is still a Marvel movie : predictable and simplistic. The CGI has gone downhill since Ragnarok.
An enjoyable movie but not revolutionnary."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,3/10,"I love the theme the message the content the strong women etc....but this film fell short on drawing me into a fantastic story, to say the least."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,1/10,"Summary of the movie :
When the side character that you see for 3 minutes in the movie is more interesting than the main characters then you know this movie is bad. Its terrible, save yourself, dont go. Its nothing like a Marvel movie we know. NOT funny, NOT interesting, WEAK plot, TERRIBLE acting, BORING everything. Skip this one or Marvel will think we want more of this crap.Note from me : Normally I do not write reviews unless I feel cheated. I am quite a fan of Marvel movies and always go to see but on that one I was thinking about leaving in the middle and asking for my money back. Worst part is that it will be probably a success because most of people just go without reading any reviews because its a Marvel movie, just like me."
BLACK PANTHER,21 November 2018,3/10,"I'm usually the last to see a movie as hyped as Black Panther. My habit is to patiently wait until a film finally become available on NetFlix for a DVD rental. Having read such glorious reviews, I was expecting something spectacular, but upon actually viewing the film, I thought it was rather lackluster. Black Panther was always a ""B"" level character in the Marvel pantheon, and the movie pretty well matches this tier. I kept hoping the film would eventually evolve into something uncanny -- it never did. It's not a bad movie. I wasn't bored. But as a benchmark, I thought Justice League was more entertaining. I just don't get the rave reviews this movie garnered."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,10/10,"All the other reviews with BP under a 5 rating on here in ludacris. Like to be honest, I think some people were upset that BP made more/ did better than most comic book movies out. I don't why it suck a problem but it is to some people. But in all fairness the was really solid from start to finish. Seen it 3 times in theaters and never got bored . Can't wait for BP 2 ."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,7/10,"This film does not quite live up to all the hype. However in no way is it a bad film nore does it deserve the negative reviews of the previous people who just seem to want to go against the grain as much as possible. 
It is not bad!! Wallpaper film which does what it says on the tin! Not the best ever film but by no means the worst.. I mean have you seen Ready Player One? Now that is a terrible film!!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,9/10,I loved every second of it and can't wait for more Black Panther
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"This movie has been overhyped and arguably overrated no doubt but it does indeed deliver on what it promised, to add no film is above criticism. You really delve into the world of Wakanda a technological and cultural phenomenon. It is very well realised, the colour palette is great and there are some really nice shots.Every single character is interesting and fun, although a few were one dimensional the actors somehow make up for it. Standouts were Chadwick Boseman, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke. When the tribal fights occur it just heightens the drama and I loved that. The Dora milage are also great too(okoye is a badass).Not to mention this film had a spectacular soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson that stays true to African music while still having a twinge of hip hop beats. Best soundtrack since the winter soldier, had to stop my self dancing in my seat.The 'villain' is compelling and presents an interesting discussion to be had in relation to Wakanda and sharing their wealth with others who need it. However, I did find the character of Killmonger tiring at times, he is a hot headed fool but eh.My major gripes were really the CGI fight scenes and the first 20 minutes were almost awful, but when this film picks up boi does it pick up. The humour is also hilarious most of the time but a few jokes made me die inside *what ArE THooOse*I genuinely don't understand how anyone can give this film 1s and 4s and in the same breath give other mcu films good scores and I love the MCU. I also can't help but notice a trend in the type of people who give it such scores, it's either that they are dc fanboys or right wing snowflakes just as there are left wing snowflakes. I hate to get into politics but it is a sad reality surrounding this film. Perhaps film is truly subjective?"
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,"This is my first ever review of any movie at IMDB.
I always watch movies after checking rating and reviews at IMDB hence, I felt I should convey my honest opinion and save others some time and money.
I have never read any of the critics review and have had always gone with user reviews. I really don't know why anyone would rate this movie more than 3-4 stars. Is this the world we live in that just because it is a black majority movie we feel obligated for something and rate this movie high to gratify some particular community. This is by far the worst ever movie I watched of a big budget production house.Acting: All actors were expressionless and I think they were concentrating more on African accent (which is by the way was more hilarious than real). CGI: I really didn't like the CGI any better or at-least something to be talked about.Story: I can understand that it was taken from comics however, plot could have been better.In general those comic and funny scenes were really bad and I didn't even smile. We were group of four friends and boy we all went with high expectations and finally two of us slept and rest two were waiting for the movie to finish."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,I loved it! I just loved it! I really loved it! Did I tell you how much I loved it? Oh! I loved it a lot! I loved it bigly! I bigly loved it! I loved it so much!
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"Unfortunately alot of people's reviews are generic and meant to sabotage the film, it is one of marvels best films, great action, and stirring emotion peppered throughout this underrated film"
BLACK PANTHER,14 March 2021,6/10,It's a ok superhero movie. Far from one of the best. Politically motivated reviews have made it the most overrated movie ever made.
BLACK PANTHER,23 July 2018,8/10,"The movie was on point with every other movie produced in recent memory and had better acting. 
All the one-star ratings is a little weird. Didn't see this many low ratings for Daredevil, Hulk, or Spiderman 3...the rating for this movie should probably be closer to 8.3 or 8.4 rather than 7.5."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,4/10,"Two hours of dull dialogue, fifteen minutes of action. If you are looking to see a Marvel Hero movie this is not for you. If you are looking for a social commentary on the injustice of the world, then this is for you.This movie was a live action Lion King meets Avengers tech which sadly insults the Lion King. Wait for the ¬¢.99 rental on iTunes."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,10/10,"This movie changed my life. I've been reading these reviews and they depress me, honestly. The acting was outstanding. It had just the right amount of feeling mixed with humor. The way the characters were written made me actually feel for them. MOST EXCITING VILLAIN I HAVE SEEN IN A MOVIE IN A LONG ASS TIME. I wanted them both to win! I couldn't decide. Back and forth, I felt for them both, I was rooting for them. This movie has shot to the top of my list of favorites. I am incredibly disappointed in the 1/10 reviews. I can understand having different opinions, but this movie deserves a 4-5/10 AT THE LEAST. Please go see it and form your own opinions. Because at least then you can say that you made the decision on how this movie was by yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,This is one of the best making super hero movies I have seen in recent times. The story buildup was perfect. The hero looks humanly and the actions were realistic enough. I will brand it as a must watch and people will love it for sure!!
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"I actually signed up so i could review this piece of garbage. After seeing the misguided clearly flawed IMDB rating my family and i went to see this utter rubbish. We all love the Marvel movies but this was just dreadful. It was worse than the worst B grade movie ive ever seen, actually B grade movies rate higher than this rubbish. I will never trust a IMBD rating again.
Do yourselves a favor and give this a miss. Id rather wash my eyes out with vinegar than watch this again."
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,4/10,"Black panther has terriably jarring comedy shoehorned into a movie which only identifies itself as wanting to be ""black"". Both the beggining action sequence and the final fight have C.G.I done by a student still in film school as it easily makes T'challa the black equivalents of stretch armstrong. Also, who films a fight scene in TOTAL darkness? Not to mention the amazing plot holes of why T'chala even had the suit in the first place, How they haven't been seen by the Wakandans outside of modern Wakanda they are LITERALLY WAVING TOO, Why the ""most advanced civilization"" relies on trial by combat as a means to coordinate a leader. The movie is nothing more than a Black wish fulfillment."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,9/10,Simply damn good. There is flaws as with any movie but overall a simply simply great movie
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,9/10,Michael B Johnson as Kilmonger makes the whole movie. Best back story of any villain since Darth Vader
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,6/10,Special effects were superb but the story was mediocre!!
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther was awesome. Dissolve yourself in the storyline, fine acting, and glorious visuals. Costumes alone are a must see. Just go see it, and don't listen to the naysayers."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,1/10,"The story was flawed but it was ok.
But the hype this movie received is just too much. It's not memorable and it only got the praise because of ethnic reasons. Just like Wonder Woman."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is truly one of the great epic tragedies of our time. It left me both saddened and inspired. Killmonger was a complex villain that my heart ached for along with T'Challa. Bravo.I am still processing. Some thoughts:*So many blurred lines between winners and losers.*An alternative title would be, ""Black Panther: Civil War""*So sad seeing the Wakandans killing one another.*For all of the harm he does, Killmonger is more of an antagonist than a proper villain in the traditional sense.*His death was profound. Painfully so."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Everything about this Movie was awesome. We Went with the kids and saw it and we were truly blown away!
BLACK PANTHER,2 July 2018,10/10,This film was incredible. So different & fresh for Marvel.
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,7/10,"The movie is good. But i cant believe they hide their secrets for so long.
The bad guy was too ""American"" style.
Soundtrack is cool. Well done. Nerveless i hear the crowd in cinema start laughing on some songs. Too bad for them.
The story and effects was good.
The suite of the Panther reminds me for the bad black Spider-man."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,5/10,"After all the hype and incredible talk surrounding the movie BLACK PANTHER, I expecting to see one of the best movies MARVEL has made to date. It was a bland movie with a boring story and preachy dialogue. I have no idea what the rave reviews are about. Maybe I saw the wrong movie...??"
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,2/10,"Didn't know what to expect before watching this move. It got a lot of praise - way to much. Plot and dialogues are realy bad. Not that much action. It's definitly one of the weakest Marvel movies, especially compared to the recent Thor movie."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,2/10,"The acting was terrible, as were the lines. The plot wasn't even hat interesting. I like most Marvel movies but this one was terrible."
BLACK PANTHER,23 June 2018,1/10,"Is this really a Marvel movie?? Plot pointless. Acting shocking all round. Only saving factor was the cinematography. I'm annoyed that I paid to rent it on Sky Store (UK), thankfully we missed it at the cinema. Agree with other reviews on here about the end credits. Wished we had watched Thor: Ragnarok again instead."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"**** Spoiler free Review***Forget about reviews, Just go and watch, enjoy 3d experience.Black panther, wonderful marvel movie, with hitech action scenes. Black panther 
is marvel batman.Just Go and enjoy with kids, Family."
BLACK PANTHER,9 July 2021,9/10,Great movie. Can't wait for the second one. Black Panther is amazing.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2020,1/10,I thought the wakanda native was a true brother but best believe that he is definitely not. NBA 2020 dunk contest should have ended with AG with 6 50s. But nope they robbed my man Aaron Gordon yet again. Highway Robbery I tell you....
BLACK PANTHER,8 September 2018,8/10,"First for all the people comparing the plot to the other empty MCU plots... did you not watch the film........Michael B Jordan's character itself could have been made into a feature film. Really really think of the trauma he went through living in the poor streets of Oakland while his first cousins, aunts and uncles thrived in a country that's supposedly one of the worst places on earth. While he lives in a country that constantly rejects him. (Even in these reviews lol) Really really take yourself out your shoes and put them in his. I know for SOME this may be very hard. To say you didn't like this film because the plot lacked is nothing but pandering and hiding behind of a veil of ignorance. It's so ironic that this movie with so much grandeur and life is getting bashed by close minded Americans. It's truly telling. If you like superhero movies and diversity doesn't shrink your existence you will bare minimum get a kick out of it. Thanks for reading."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"I'm a 66 yr. old white lady and my 71 year old BFF went and we had a blast. So different. Loved the Black Panther character and all of the great costumes. Ignore the haters, they are probably those white supremicist types. Fun movie if you love Super Hero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,6/10,"First of all, I have to say I liked Black Panther in Civil War, I thought he had a cool looking suit and he looked cool while fighting. I did not have high expectations for this movie though even after I saw how hyped it was.I have to say this movie is quite boring and the whole plot is a mess. I did not like it. Not one bit. The CGI was cheap too. I dont say it is BAD, its just not good and I cannot understand how can people love it so much, but maybe I just did not get it."
BLACK PANTHER,30 October 2018,10/10,"I can not believe the level of haters in these reviews. SMH. Yes I can. It comes with the territory. This movie did not have so many repeat viewers out of pity. It was an amazing film! I saw the movie at least 4 times on the big screen and the audience responded with enthusiastic applause each time. I have always been a Batman fanatic, but Black Panther is now my all time favorite. The acting was solid. The action was great from beginning to end and the message was on time."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,8/10,I've been looking forward to seeing this forever and it didn't disappoint. I'm not a huge Marvel fan but I'll check out the films that catch my interest and the trailer for this one hooked me early. (Also side note the soundtrack is killer. I've been listening to it ever since it dropped.) I do love how Marvel finds a distinct subgenre within the superhero genre for all of their movies. This almost had a Shakespearean flavor to it with the palace intrigue and watching heroes plot and battle for the throne. Stellar performances across the board. I was surprised by how effective Michael B Jordan was as the villian as he's always such a charmer. I'm very disappointed by all the negative reviews that seem to be part of the pre announced campaign by racist trolls to smear the movie like they did with The Last Jedi. If a movie isn't your thing that's one thing but to attack a film because it's lead by black actors or has a female protagonist... you're time of blatant bigotry is up folks. Join the rest of us and live in a world where respect for everyone is the standard or learn to live in the shadows and have your voice ignored like the rest of us have since the dawn of time.
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,8/10,I have enjoyed everything with this MCU starting with Iron Man. This was great action. Loved Shuri. I think she's cocky but she can back it up. She's cute and funny. Action was of course great. The movie showcased the Wakandan tech nicely. It's a good addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ranks higher than Iron Man 3 and Thor 2. Decent movie and good fun. Nothing wrong with it and it sets up the Black Panther character nicely so the audience will have a better understanding for upcoming movies. I'll have to see it again in order to make a more critical review.
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,8/10,I was very excited about watching this movie only to be let down. For all the money spent they on cgi. The studio could have save some and had a better story line. Very predicable.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,2/10,"Am I getting to old for this, or did this movie look like ""If you do not agree with me you are dead and I can still be the good guy"" ... ??The bad guys of this movie are the ones who want to share what Wakanda have to the rest of the world... Wakanda operates in riches and people walk around in tailored suits while 99% of Africa is in the ruins and they claim to have been doing so for generations... If you have a problem with this, you are DEAD even if you are my brother or cousin or any other blood relative. Wakanda have flying ships, bullet trains, and markets swarming with people... so how big is wakanda and if it covers that much area to have bullet trains, why hasn't it been noticed so far?!? In all fairness, Kilmonger did win the throne fair and square... He didnt cheat, they fought and he won, hence getting the throne. He did not literally yet commit a crime in Wakanda to deserve death?? I mean couldn't they just tranquilize him and talk it out?? The so-called multi-purpose vibranium couldn't handle such a situation??They whole IDEA that the Black Panther can be switched on and off with a potion is stupid too!! And clearly anyone can walk in and steal those precious glowy flowers!!It is watchable, but just stupid story telling. Marvel can make good movies if they wanted... Spiderman Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok and Captain America Winter soldier, in that order, are still my favorites."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2019,10/10,"This movie gave me so much LIFE. I saw it six times with a variety of folks. Yes, it is a fantasy... but one you wish were real. Hater reviewers can't seem to understand the impact... not choosing to relate... but what if there were a country on the planet where white supremacy had not been allowed to rule and reign? A people who had escaped colonization? Excellence, dignity, technological advancement, self-esteem... These qualities exude from every cell of the film from acting to costumes to cinematography."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,1/10,Basic and boring. I wouldn't recommend due to the slow pace and the lackluster plot.
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2019,1/10,"Absolutely awful, totally cringefest, what a waste of time"
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,5/10,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Was honestly a bit hesitant to watch it, since I didn't really care for the Black Panther in the Avengers. But after hearing that this site claims that the movie was the best Marvel movie ever, I had to at least watch it. I'm white, so going into a movie with a mostly black cast, I knew it might be a challenge to be unbiased in my review; however, with only a very few exceptions I could almost forget the predominant color of most of the stars. I am going to try to ignore those few exceptions for the rest of this review.One thing that is very clear after finally watching the movie is that both the 1 star reviews AND the 10 star reviews are clearly wrong. Maybe one happened to offset the other, which is probably the case. Clearly the 10 stars were either people who wanted it to be the best movie, and the 1 stars wanted to balance them out. Whatever the case, this is a middle of the road type of movie. It's not the best movie made, nor is it the worst. If I could have rated this 5.5 stars, I would have. It had such potential to be a very good movie. Had they trimmed about 30 minutes of the more boring (and unnecessary) aspects, it could have easily been a 7.The good: I liked just about everyone. The action scenes were pretty good. Even the CGI was better than I expected, since the one they show here on this site is awful, but it looked much better in the actual movie. I liked the futuristic city of Wakanda, and T'Challa's sister WAS the highlight most everyone talks about. She should have her own movie. Heck, she could be the Black Panther. The bad: I can see why there are comparisons to the Lion King. Wakanda is the most developed country in the world, but they actually allow others to battle the heir to the throne? And if they can beat him, they become King? Seriously? So if someone stronger than T'Challa, who is son of their King, beats him, T'Challa is a nobody? And this person who just happens to be stronger now rules the most powerful and developed country in the world? Seriously? I mean this happens not once, but twice in the movie. I actually rolled my eyes when the 2nd one occurred. So this crazy a-hole has a chance to be king, just because his father was brother to the king? Well, I'm pretty sure the guy was a traitor, so that would sever all ties to the kingdom, but I guess that doesn't count? Anymore than Scar killing his brother to become king? This right here lost them a star or two. Having the people of Wakanda, especially their General, agreeing to follow him lost another star. It seemed the only ones who had any sense were T'Challa's mother, sister and his ex-lover Nakia, all three of whom were smarter and more loyal than the lot of them. Like I said, it had the potential to be at least a 7 star movie, but as it stands, it's no where near as good as any of other Avenger movies...or any other action movie. I could say more, but I think I've made my point."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2019,4/10,"A banal and predictable story to pain. I wished to turn it off after 10 minutes, but I've watched it to the end. Now I regret.."
BLACK PANTHER,6 July 2018,8/10,"This movie has a seriously stable racial undertone. That unfortunately a lot of people are unable to relate to. The critics gave this movie incredible reviews because of what not only was done cinematically but culturally as well. The acting is special and I believed to be heart felt. Considering this is a first of its kind I was pleased that it didn't feel like it would be the last of its kind. The music speaks to you and gives you a great feeling of pride. No matter where you come from. I battled with the decisions the characters were making and the challenges they were faced which is a great thing because the movie made you think on several different levels. I read someones review and he/she stated the story was ripped from The Lion King but yet they rated it a one. If that's the case are you mad because you felt it wasn't original or did you dislike The Lion King too(another movie involving African culture). Lol what a misguided childhood if you didn't like the The Lion King.
Is there a large use of CGI yes but name a movie even without action that doesn't. Marvel/Disney are giving us awesome affects. Appreciate it! This is a superhero movie! I completely wish people that are bias would stop seeing these movies eyes wide shut and live a little. Watch this movie think outside the box. It's now one of my favorites from the Marvrel Universe and they are not at all giving us bad movies especially not ones that you could possibly put the rating of a 1 or under a 6 for that matter. Ones,twos and threes are for B movies with terrible visual effects and absolutely no plot. Know the rating system so you don't give people the wrong ideas! 
Lets just be honest people drug this movie across the dirt more than any other Marvel superhero movie. Why is that?? Oh you know why! Totally didn't deserve it! Great movie that should, if you're morally correct work for everyone."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,1/10,Definitely the worst marvel film (on a par with fantastic 4 2015) very disappointed
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,1/10,"I had to forcibly hold myself back in the chair to watch through this film. As much as the message that this film was trying to communicate for political correctness, the plots and characters were so shallow that it was horrifying to watch."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,10/10,"The movie is awesome! The world thinks so and the proof is in the box office sales: another $100 million on it's SECOND weekend in theaters.The problem is that seeing powerful, wealthy, advanced black society just doesn't sit well with some people and that's what these overwhelmingly negative reviews on IMDB mostly reflect...shock, discomfort, disbelief. People are using this forum to talk down this movie (they actually promised to do so BEFORE the movie debuted) and vent frustration over seeing blacks achieve, whether it's the black director and black cast or the fictitious characters they've portrayed. For once, they've made a big-budget movie about Africa that isn't about slavery or people dying of disease and being ravaged by war and poverty....and some rac*st folks just can't get behind that. Because that's not the Africa they know and believe in. They'll tell you their only problem is with the plot, the action, too much hype, etc. Sure...Cool story. Be above that kind of pettiness and go treat yourself to a top notch entertainment experience. It's just a movie, you're not conceding any sort of victory to black people by you simply enjoying a good show."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,3/10,Honestly...don't waste your time..This is the worst Marvel movie ever...
BLACK PANTHER,14 September 2018,10/10,"Generally I don't bother writing reviews but wow, a sudden influx of 10+ one star reviews all saying it was ""overhyped"" or ""overrated""? Suspicious.This movie is pretty typical superhero fare, but honestly, all Marvel movies follow the typical hero's journey. This is just the only Marvel movie (probably one of the few that exist, period) with a primarily black cast. Honestly, the creative and innovative combinations of tribal, traditional and modern costume/architecture rates high in my book. Great cast, great characters and a villain with an understandable motive. Is it over the top action, sci-fi technology? Yeah, but damn isn't that what we want from our superhero movies?Bottom line, if you like the superhero movie trend and aren't totally racist this movie will appeal to you. If you are a boring racist, I hope you have fun leaving your predictable 1 star review, and I'm sorry you have nothing better going on in your life lmao"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Good movie with the theme of family problems with royal culture. In this film will be presented progress and tradition that complement each other. In this film we can not fully judge who is good and evil, because each character has its own goals that can be spelled 'good'.The lack of this film is the scope of the small problem that makes many characters not so developed."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,1/10,"Flipped through the early audience reviews this afternoon. Really convinced Disney paid for a majority of the 7+ reviews. Saw this movie with 8 ten-year-old boys, Marvels target audience. They unanimously agreed that it was boring and too long. This movie is garbage."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Unimpressive work. The CGI is by far the worst of all the Marvel movies, the story is predictable and boring, the acting is weak and it just doesn't deliver."
BLACK PANTHER,20 May 2018,1/10,"Bad actors, bad script, and what's up with fake accent"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,2/10,"The hype was real. From the brief intro in Civil War, I was really hyped for Black Panther. However, after watching it i was utterly disappointed.
A cliche story with a very weak resolution to the ""hero's conflict""; compounded by the fact that the entire movie had a very vague plot made it a massive disappointment. The only selling point, in my honest opinion, of this movie is that it represented the ""black"" community. 
2/10
Cliche story and anti-climactic resolution to conflict!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2018,4/10,Visually appealing but too many plot holes to be considered anything but mediocre. The CGI scenes of the flying ship was poorly executed and distracting.
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,10/10,This film has so many levels of greatness. Only thing I would change is to make it longer. Show more of Killmonger's back story. Show how he grew up. Congrats to everyone on this project!
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther has got people throbbing, some saying it gave rise to Africa in the MCU. Critic's seem to all love it... reviews have been rave, even before the movie actually opened in Theaters. I found it funny, touching, strong as well as weak at some points... I do have to say that it has been over-hyped. It's not as good as Age of Ultron, and many of MCU releases. It didn't have a true villain we grew hatred for, Killmonger was just some angry kid to be honest. The women, do pick it up though, I'd hang a few but all of them did this movie good. Their roles infused well with the plot, and none of them disappointed me. To be honest with everyone else, I'd pretty much say that (as a black person) we loved Black Panther for it's cast and setting... Culturally - Black Panther is one of the greatest film's ever made, but Critically - It doesn't really deserve the universal acclaim. 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,10/10,"This film seems to have done something that many Marvel films have been lacking in recent years, it conveyed real emotion. 
There wasn't the regular reliance on quick witted jokes when fight scenes were becoming boring which have become commonplace in Thor, Dr Strange, and Avengers. Instead each fight scene was important for the development of the plot and the character arcs often showing us the struggles characters had choosing their loyalties between country, humanity or their loved ones.
This movie avoided, for the most part, the cliche of the all powerful object which if the enemy get their hands on it will bring about the destruction of the universe as we know it. In Black Panther the story trying to be told is of the dangers of isolationism and the conflicts and caveats to blind loyalty to your country not the normal story told in Marvel films of fighting against the threat of the destruction of the universe. There a thread of ideas weaved throughout this film, illusions to the injustices of colonialism and slavery, and the many injustices that persist in our world today like the ever widening wealth inequality on earth and across the USA. This change of tone may have thrown some regular Marvel enthusiasts off slightly but it is vitally important. I believe that the inability to see these messages or the rejection of the truth in them is something that has driven many bad reviews on this site.
The director and writer managed to build multiple interesting characters all with developed characteristics and understandable reasoning behind their actions. Our main antagonist for example had an important relatable world view and his motivations were not so different from many of the hero's of Marvel and DC.
I am thoroughly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on this site and have noticed that the only criticisms they have been able to conjure could be applied to any comic book based film from the last 10 years. It seems they've been placed here to slander the film when there is little evidence that any of these 'critics' have actually taken the time to watch this film.
I need not mention the great things this film has done for the empowerment of poc and women. As a white man I may be the wrong person to represent what Hollywood's acceptance that a film like this needed to be made means to the world. With a nearly all black cast and strong female characters in positions we wouldn't normally see them in technology and war we're finally seeing some progress. I'm happy to see that Hollywood is changing its ways and I hope this isn't just an isolated example.
Along with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Wonder Woman I rate this as one of Marvels greatest successes, I hope they continue to make movies like this in the future and less of the over reliance of Bathos that we've seen in recent years in Dr Strange and Avengers."
BLACK PANTHER,4 September 2019,1/10,"The script is a corrupted one, which makes no sense in real national security concerns. And the whole setup is rather ridiculous. Not worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,10/10,"Despite being a 10/10 film, the antagonist will annoy you with his unprecedented irrationality. How is he this ""specops/super genius"" and still this immatur?"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Black Panther is pretty run-of-the-mill Disney/Marvel if you take it at face value. However, with its somewhat Shakespearian plot combined with themes about the dangers of isolationism it brings with it a few takes on the superhero-blockbuster formula that feels fresh and captivating. It's one of those rare Disney/Marvel movies that stands on its own feet instead of being a 2-hour set up for the next project in line.On top of that Black Panther also takes a couple of well deserved jabs at social injustices as well as both ""old-school"" western imperialism and modern western imperialism. The jabs may be modest and somewhat unsophisticated (which is to be expected when it comes to movies made and released on this scale) but at least they are still there, and that is something I very much appreciate!Script, pacing, acting, CGI etc. strikes me as above average overall so no complaints there. In short, Black Panther is well worth a watch and hopefully something that might contribute to Disney/Marvel upping their game yet another step in the future."
BLACK PANTHER,26 January 2019,2/10,"This is ""Coming to America"" meets ""Buck Rodgers"". Awful special effects, costumes, script, music, acting, everything. In the future, this will be looked at as an example of when the Academy only nominated a film because of race. If you liked it, you have zero standards in the true excellence in film making. This is absolutely no where close and it's appalling it's being nominated that way. This should've been a Saturday morning movie for 12-year olds. Glad I only paid my Netflix subscription to watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I am an avid DC fan. I am humbled and moved by this film. There are so many powerful messages interwoven although it. It does political, racial, and family values in one sitting. Sad as it is to say, anyone who rates this low wasn't watching the movie. You were looking for a superhero movie, but surprise.. its not a superhero movie. Marvel was making a giant statement; heroes come in all colors. As easy as it is to dismiss when most superheroes have been white, its good to see something different. I don't want them to stop at this. I look forward to other nationalities to bring forward some encouraging and uplifting heroes the children of their origin can identify with in cinema. You can downplay the cinema when you've always taken for granted that you had someone to look up to or aspire to be like, but this is new for many of us that haven't. I applaud this. The cinematography, the acting, the storytelling; all incredibly outstanding."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Characters deliver the scenes in a beautiful way. Has a really good overall message. Plus it's action packed.
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2019,1/10,This movie was so bad I turned it off mid movie. This review has everything to do with the lack of being a good movie story line and nothing to do with race. Oscar worthy? You must be kidding.
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,8/10,"The script and the general feeling of the movie is great.
Every hero in these movies gets heightened if the ""BAD"" guy/anti-hero is great. From that perspective the movie is greater than initial expectations.But......
Black Panther's role in MCU is the equivalent of Batman in DC. Gadjet,ninja,scientist, and acts in shadows and is always prepared for everything.T'challa(Chadwick Bosman) is not fitting for the role. He is pretty much younger than the hero of the comic, he is not putting a serious-shadowy figure of the comic character. He is also very charming and sometimes his baby-face is not fitting the ""blackness"" of the character, at least from the comic perspective. I rated this with 8,but with a better T'challa it would be a pure 9."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"Really good, one of my favorite marvel movies. It was interesting and really funny. The costumes and music was really good. It is a very intense movie."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"The family and I just got back a few hours ago from seeing Black Panther. I've always had a fascination with this mysterious character but only have a handful of comics of him. To me, this is a character I don't know as much about. I knew about Wakanda and the tribal elements of his culture but wow, I am a super fan now. The movie was incredible, and one of my favorite comic movies I've seen. With all of the elements I knew of that encapsulate the character, fighting style, ability, family and honor, this movie goes way more in depth with T'Challa. His way of thinking, his calm and intelligent demeanor and his way of recognizing that times are changing and that if changes have to be made, they can be for the betterment of all people. The themes in the movie definitely moved me, that and the incredible action scenes throughout. I loved the villain(s), the plot, the costumes, the cinematography and how it seems to connect with the Marvel Universe. Awesome time at the movies for sure. This movie is one to remember, far more complex and enjoyable than other comic book films. Always love Marvel but this ones is one of my favorites for sure. Even though this is another piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's a great film either way in its own right."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,6/10,"The hype for this movie was over the top. At one point it was 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Not even The Godfather is a 100%. You would think from the reviews this was the greatest movie ever made but it's not.At its best, the CGI is good and the film earnings prove that you can make a ton of money and have a decent film with a cast of people of color. I'm excited to see Wakanda integrate into the rest of the MCU. At it's worst, this movie is overtly political aimed at taking advantage of the BLM movement and Marvel's attempt to be everyone's SJW. It shames and guilts white people that Western society is the cause for everything that's wrong in the world.Enjoy the movie, but be prepared to cringe."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"Chadwick Boseman plays the Black Panther, the new king of Wakanda - a mantle that has befallen him because of the recent death of his father, which we saw in Civil War.A running theme throughout this film is whether T'challa (The Black Panther) is ready and fit to take the throne. Chadwick's T'challa is a sweet, undemanding, respectful king. Almost boyish in his portrayal and you can understand why his people just WANT to protect him and be loyal to him. He's a good man, and as his dead father says, ""it's hard for a good man to be king"". T'challa, like almost every other character in this film, has a STRONG defining characteristic, and they have to deal with the flaw of that characteristic at some point during the film. For T'challa, his goodness is both his strength and his flaw.I read some of the reviews saying T'challa is a weak king. Well, those who say that have missed the point entirely. T'challa is not weak. He rules his people with strength but also has the RESPECT for others and his people to allow them to be strong along with him and voice their opinions. And some of those people he has respect for are the Dora Milaje and his sister, Shuri.The Dora Milaje is an all female army led by the general, Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). They are one of the greatest things about this movie. The Dora Milaje's sole mission is to protect Wakanda and the king of Wakanda, whoever that king may be. So Okoye is led by duty. And her sense of duty is strong and VERY admirable. The struggle and flaw of her character comes when the villain, Killmonger, takes the throne. As Dora Milaje, she has to serve the new king, even though she doesn't believe in him. And the portrayal and emotion Danai Gurira gives during these climactic scenes (and throughout the rest of the movie to be honest) is gold.Shuri, T'challa's little sister, is a technological genius and brings a lot of the comedy of the film. Her and T'challa's bond is evident, and it's one of the greatest relationships in the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I get the impression that some people in here have just found out what ""hype"" means and they find it necessary to use it to show everybody how cool they are for not being impressed about something new. Again, not everybody must like everything, but ""it offers nothing new to the Marvel universe that has not been done already.."" a comment says. WHAT?!The movie is great in its own way. Go and watch it. Don't expect to see a masterpiece, as this is a damn superhero movie. Take it as it is. It makes sense, it fits in the universe and is really enjoyable. Who says something about this movie being a political agenda, please, it has nothing to do with it. Maybe you've seen another movie."
BLACK PANTHER,25 May 2020,5/10,"This is one very good movie for children. Or, at least, a very expensive one."
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,10/10,"It's beautiful to look at, well written, and fun.A lot of research and hard work went into the costume design and it paid off. The the relationships between the characters are believable and the actors have a ton of chemistry together."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,,"I can not believe I was conned into buying a ticket for this joke of a movie. My rating is a big fat ZERO. Acting bad, plot worse. DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH."
BLACK PANTHER,15 December 2018,1/10,I don't even want to write a review about it. It was so bad that it doesn't deserve any explanation. Please watch to understand what a BAD movie means.
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,1/10,"A wasteful movie like this shouldn't get high reviews. If you disintegrate the movie then , those small parts like, makeup, technology....were all good on their own but never as a movie. Bottom line, Its a camel."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,5/10,"Very weak stupid story, very predictable. most of my rating is just for the visual. expected way more from this. afsos"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,2/10,"Maybe they should concentrate on making them more like the comic (Marvel) instead of going so far off some might say the only thing that resembles the comic is the title, i agree with ""srawbrats"" if you really want to see a ""Black superhero"" movie then ""Blade trilogy"" is by far a lot better than this title.
Maybe hollywood should stick to movies instead of politics !"
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,5/10,"A fairly entertaining film with touching moments if you dont think too much about it. 
*SPOILERS*
To be fair, im just stating points that ruined the movie experience for me so dont get offended by my petpeeves.Is anyone bothered by the fact that T'Chaka is ""forced"" to kill his brother in order to save zuri? i mean, that guy have a suit made of near indestructible vibranium vs a guy with a handheld pistol. Do he really need to sink his claw into his brother chest immediately and ultimately killing him? he could have just disarm his brother or just stand between them. The whole conflict of the movie could have been avoided if T'Chaka isn't o trigger happy with his claws.
And somehow the law of inertia doesn't apply in wakanda because a 3tons charging rhino can just stop immediately and the rider sitting on it doesn't even budge. This ruined a perfectly cool scene for me because there's no weightage behind it. 
Also, the power level of vibranium is awfully inconsistence in this film. It's supposed to be almost indestructible yet a car made out of it was destroyed by a hand energy cannon. FYI, i didnt assumed the car to be made of vibranium myself, they stated it themselves in the movie. Somehow i feel like Captain America vibranium shield is very much stronger than the vibranium depicted in this movie. Just me? ok..."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,5/10,"Storyline like a Thor 1 = Power Struggle.
The Battle like a Ant man = Main character and enemy character have the same ability.
The different is just a technology classic to modern..
Sorry.. but this is make me little disappointed :("
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,1/10,"This was overall a good movie honestly, but people like me started to watch this movie after getting so much praise and tons of positive reviews and you got nothing as per expected you'll definitely hate this.I was waited long to watch this but when my eait is over I realised some wait never should over!"
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,2/10,"This is a completely unbiased and honest opinion of mine. I was actually really hyped for the movie. Didn't want to be influenced before watching the movie. So, decided to not check reviews or anything before watching the movie. Boy, I wish I had. Now it just feels 2 hours of my life simply went down the toilet.Don't get me wrong, I like the character ""Black Panther"". But the plot is so stupid and stretched so thin, it felt like torture throughout the whole 2 hours. I have no idea how this movie has a average rating of 7.6. It shouldn't have anything beyond 5 or 6."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,8/10,"I didn't know what to expect of this movie before it came out. I ended up watching it 3 times on theaters. I loved the whole landscapes, colors and can't forget about the entire soundtrack! What got me inside of the movie also was the actors ""African"" accents in the entire film and the way that combine with ""American"" accent. I just thought that was something amazing and really loved it about this movie. The story is also (I think) something practically new, and I, as a Marvel movies fan, would add this to a ""5 best marvel movies"" list (if I had one)."
BLACK PANTHER,18 December 2018,9/10,"I like black panther because it was entertaining and very interesting to watch. I've never seen anything like it before. I've seen the reviews and I'm not persuaded by what they say. I enjoyed the movie because it had a great story and the plot was easy to follow. I recommend to my friends to see it, but they listen to others. I believe if you watch this movie all the way through you will enjoy it like I did"
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,3/10,Wanted it to be good but unfortunately the worst Marvel to date..
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,10/10,This film was a good stand alone as it goes into Black Panther's background & gives an insight on the character. It's also given a good set up for Infinity War as that's partially based in Wakanda. Would definitely recommend!
BLACK PANTHER,11 November 2018,1/10,"Always looked forward to the Marvel installments, but this one fell flat. The movie was overly hyped and lacked likeable characters except one. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue was in my opinion, the only interesting character. The casting was done right, but the characters lacked life and substance. The movies CGI car chase scene had a Green Lantern feel, the bad guy Erik Killmonger was more annoying than anything else. The spectators on the cliff during the ritual fight was probably the cheesiest part of the movie. This was the weakest of the marvel movies, hopefully they can improve the character development with the second Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,26 August 2018,1/10,"The only reason I gave this 1 star is because I had too. The movie was so predictable, CGI was pretty awful. The villain was rubbish couldn't they have another villain that was the same as the black panther. I wanted to walk out of the cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"It's not everyday that we are able to see black men and women in its true state of being. As a KING, a Queen and a Warrior. This movie stir such a since of black pride within me. For once we was not a pimp, a junkie, a w****, a dead beat dad, a crazy black woman. We were strong, powerful, intelligent, sensitive and loving.
BRAVO!!!!
You proved that you can make a box hit without having to show naked women, strong sex scenes or profound language. 
I am ready to move to Wakanda"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,1/10,"This is a long, boring, stupid movie. I'm angry that I fell for the hype, and I cannot understand why the professional critics raved about it. From the cardboard cutout characters, to the mess of a storyline, to the poorly choreographed fight scenes, this movie has nothing to recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I found the movie to be absolutely fantastic. Chadwick Boseman was wonderful as King T'Challa with a superb supporting cast. Michael B Jordan's character was a far more relate-able villain than other Marvel villain's to the point you feel sorry for him and almost want him to succeed. A villain with good reasons that have fallen to corruption and anger where he becomes the very thing he's trying to fight against. You are both interested in Killmonger as well as disgusted with him. He makes you hate him, but feel sorry for him and kind of want him to succeed.The story is intriguing and the lines of good and bad have become blurred. It grabs your attention and holds you tight as it takes you on a ride through family dynamics and the decision to leave Wakanda hiding, or let the world know Wakanda.I find it hard to explain...So I ask that you see it. You MUST see this movie. Go out. Get a ticket. Watch it. This movie isn't just a good Marvel movie...it's a good movie. It needs our support."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,1/10,"I don't know why people made this film up to be the best marvel film of all time??? it's just a senseless action movie like Wonder Woman with no brainer script, it's made for kids who are about enter the puberty. I think Marvel truly destroying their good reputation with junk like this.My rating 0 out of 10."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Well, I loved it and fully believe it walks with Marvel's best (which I feel are Captain America 2; Iron Man; Avengers; Thor Ragnarok; Guardians 2 and Doctor Strange).Not because of the incredible visuals - wow. just extraordinary and rich and very, very well thought through as they were.But because of the way the story meshes with the Characters/ performances (one needs the other and here you get both). It wasn't a wholly unique plot: Boy loses country, boy finds country/ a journey of self discovery in which the hero uncovers not all is what he thought it was.But... the story was given a hero with conscience and a villain who didn't just want to take over the world because he wanted a gold toilet. My only concerns here were that I feel Whittaker was under- used/developed and Kaluuya's character arc unresolved (although perhaps that is a future focus). Boseman was magnificent. At turns both tortured and elated. Nyongo; Bassett and Freeman were all on their A Game. Standouts for me personally though were Guirai; Jordan; Serkis and Wright. Both they and their characters worked excellently. In particular, I could watch these guys all day. I believe Wright could carry her own Black Panther sequel one day. Serkis was his powerhouse best and Jordan... well... his characterisation lifted it again for me. I could feel his anger and his 'cause'. The Director wisely left us to our own reflections on whether one of the two 'masked' the other or if they 'walked in parallel'. The 'cause' part was interesting as there was a real philosophical weight to that as in the best of Marvel. The Winter Soldier asks if we have the balance right between freedom and protection and the Panther asks if are right to isolate ourselves - should we act or wait? Wakanda's isolationism may be illusory: is non-intervention really just a sin of omission? Heavy stuff, but Coogler proves up to the lifting for me.Black Panther was everything I hoped it would be and I want to return to Wakanda now every bit as much as to the stories of my favourites, Captain America and Doctor Strange."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,2/10,"Hoping to see at least a good movie but it is relly bad, awful jokes, the actors does not share any feelings at all, bad acting from everybody, no scene to remember from the entire movie, the sister is the most anoying character i've seen in a long time.... can't believe its rated so high."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,1/10,"I normally dont do the reviews. It's my first review in few years use of imdb. I went to movie and spent $80 on it which was a total waste. I couldn't give it a zero rating so i had to give 1. If this movie is rated above 7, then masterpieces deserve 100 plus. This isn't even worth one rating. Real poor storyline and even poorer acting on top. If u read this, save your money and 2 hours of life which is never coming back again."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,8/10,"Yes, it has its own political orientation. Yes, you have seen parts of this movie before. Yes, there is a whole lot of CGI in this film. If you like Superhero movies (and I'm underwhelmed by most of them), you'll probably like Black Panther.The cast is first rate and pulls it off. I liked the leader of the Gorilla tribe and his devotional praise of Hanuman, even if that particular mythological figure is more Indian than African. It was still a clever touch, and hopefully some schoolkid somewhere does his proverbial homework and looks that name up.The visuals are generally good if not a little derivative of movies like Thor, The Avengers, or maybe even Star Wars: Episode One at the end. There's a lot of Wonderwoman, Batman, and even some Casino Royale thrown into the script. there's maybe even a passive resemblance to Elysium in some of this movie's themes. I feel like I've seen massive underground mines/dwellings in a lot of films over the years. However, the more movies you see, the more you see them in other movies. Eventually age catches up with all of us, and our taste in films sadly is not spared the blunting of memory to dilute the sensuous new. Alas, this movie is definitely made for children and teens.Yes, the film is not perfect. Klaue dies way to early, much like another recent Andy Serkis character which will not be named here. I wish that the MCU would start using more practical effects in lieu of the expansive CGI that permeates these films. Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott need to give these Feige and company a few pointers. I could have done without some of the Urban Street art that permeates the imagery of the film, especially in the lab and Wakandan street scenes. It just seemed out of place here to me but, overall, the artistic conception of this film is pretty solid. In the end, it's a comic book movie and you'll ether like it or you won't. I liked it"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,1/10,Why was this movie so hyped??? Think this was one of the worst Marvels. Story line bad. Is this going to be the same with the new Avangers??
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"I can't believe all the other reviewers giving 1 and 2 stars, I dont know whether they are trolls or not but it almost seems they are not giving it a chance.Black Panther continues with Marvel's awesome track record of good films. But this one plays out more like a shakespearean tale rather than a superhero movie, which is good. The action sequences are the films weakest point, the political drama playing out being more interesting. This is in part helped by Killmonger character, Michael B Jordan totally rocking in this role. But he is not used to his full potential, I wanted to see more of him. Also having fun with his character is non-CGI Andy Serkis who looks like a genuine badass. All the others are pretty good too. Surprisingly this is one Marvel movie where they have toned down on the comedy making it seem the stakes are high and not something to be joked over. This is complimented with the awesome soundtrack which moves you and cheer for the kiing."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"Having watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) I have enjoyed all of them except for Iron Man 3 which is the only misstep - I will be as objective and unbiased in my review as possible.My top three rankings of the MCU movies are Winter Soldier, Iron Man and The Avengers.Where does Black Panther rank. Well it's safe to say whilst this movie isn't perfect it's easily the best MCU movie ever. Its groundbreaking and very entertaining, Coogler hit this one out of the ballpark.Characters both good and evil have depth, the story which picks up where Civil War left is both a continuation and stand alone story. New comers will feel at home. Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger has elevated MCU villains to new heights. He will have a long lasting impact and has raised the standard for villains in cinema. The movie is for everyone of all races, political leanings or ages. This is first and foremost a fun movies. Veteran actors Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker, give stunning performances complimented by their younger counterparts Lupita, Danai and co.Black Panther is not perfect , its a 9/10, but I rated it 10 to counter the mass 1 star ratings. This is easily the best MCU movie ever.A Wakanda-ful movie. Black Panther takes the MCU to new heights."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"I watched the movie yesterday and I would say its awesome. Graphics, animation is clean. Every scene is in balance by action then to drama then to comedy vice versa. The story line for me is too short but of course I understand that movies now a days have limited duration. I Can't wait to see Black panther in the Avenger's Infity War. So excited here! 
To those who dislikes, I don't care I guess they have their own bases as do I have mine. 
For those who haven't seen this, don't miss."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,1/10,"Dont understand how it got such a high score on IMDB... 
The plot is seriously boring. the acting is terrible and the ""comedy"" doesnt work. 
the result is one of the most boring and lame movies i have seen."
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,6/10,Entertaining movie don't believe all the hype there was no real response from everyone at theatre.
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2020,5/10,This is probably one of the worst movies in the Marvel univers.
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,4/10,"Bad story and even the acting is very disappointing. Don't know why Marvel made this garbage. I really didn't expect anything before starting the movie because I already saw that the IMDB is flooded is bad review for this movie. But still I'm very disappointed because I thought at least the acting will be good but nah! Please don't bother to watch movie but if you do, you may wanna skip to the post-credit scene. It's the only that I enjoyed in the whole movie."
BLACK PANTHER,7 February 2019,8/10,"Loved the action! And all of the supporting cast, the sets are amazingly stunning , costumes are just beautiful!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,1/10,Right from the start when it starts I hated everything the actors the way they talk everything is rubbish
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2019,5/10,"So to start off, the movie seems pretty cool. Black Panther has been bestowed a super suit from the Gods (aliens). The intro begins by explaining how the Wakandans (people of Wakanda) received all their futuristic tech. I won't burden you with the details, but basically, the setting is actually a pretty neat ""Afro-Futuristic"" one.Multiple tribes inhabit Wakanda and fight over who will become the next king. Although the method is sort of tribal, it plays into the idea of what it would be like if tribal African groups suddenly received a futuristic basket of technological goods. They would still attempt to retain their culture while adapting to the new tech.As for the superhero part, T'Challa is the Black Panther. He does have a charm, but is still very generic. As for the villain, he is absurd and ridiculous. His acting was comparable to a robot reading from a script! Not to mention the anti-white attitude displayed throughout the film from him. On another note, the attitude towards white people in the movie is very poor as not only the villain, but the ""Good Guys"" set this anti-white narrative as well. I won't dwell on this, as it's not a major thing, but definitely comes up at least four times throughout the film. The beginning fight scene and the car chase were pretty much the only entertaining parts for me. The ending fight scene was a bit pathetic. I just couldn't have any real attachment to any of the characters so none of the fight scenes really mattered. Overall, it was entertaining, but there are a lot of better superhero movies out there. This just doesn't make the cut for me, resulting in 5 out of 10 Stars."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,4/10,"Black panther has 97% on rotton tomato and it's definitely overrated. The story is very predictable and ordinary, it usually goes:
1. black panther (or any other superhero) shows his power to make you know how good he is. 
2. Reveal the bad guy part of the story
3. Reveal the good guy part of the story
4. Good guy and bad guy fight, bad guy wins
5. Good guy somehow find his power back
6. They fight again, good guy wins.And it's the same here, No surprise, and many flaws. Why do they ride on rhino to fight when they have the best technology in the world? Why the technologies was not used to improve people's living quality. All I see is a fancy watch, but they still live in like the 50s. Every technology in the country seems like it's invented by black panther's sister. Just disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,I had a special good feeling after watching Black Panther. I rarely have good feelings after movies and it was a different satisfaction. The social- und political-critict in the film is an important element of it. It calls problems by name. Black Panther is an important film specially for people of color. Because it is a main stream film that thematize significant issues concerning them. Issues which are not only significant for people of color but also significant for the world society to understand and to address.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,6/10,"Too much talk and not enough action. Fell asleep in the movie. A lot of computer generated action and looks really fake at times. This is one where I am hoping the sequel will be better than the original. Too political at times, politics equals boring."
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2018,10/10,"I have watched every MCU movie and I think every single one is great, even the early Thor and Captain ones, so take what I say with that in mind. Black Panther is not only great in my mind, it is AMAZING! I love the action, the drama, the setting, and the characters. Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa has actual character growth throughout the film and it makes for an incredible journey. I even think Killmonger may be the one of the best villains to date. The main reason I wanted to write a review is because I think it is awful how many horrible reviews have been popping up on here about this movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but never in my wildest dreams would I think this movie deserves a 1/10."
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,1/10,Quick and easy. Story is vary predictable. It's vary over rated. I wanted to like it I really did. I seen it with a full movie theater nobody seemed happy with it when leaving the movie theater. I think it just over hyped.
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,9/10,"This is a great quality movie from storyline to the setting, I will say this even after watching Infinity Wars that this has one of the most down to earth and relatable villains isn't the MCU. If you have a problem with this movie your morals are not all there great time, worth the watch at least one time. It definycan stir up conversation in today's society."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,5/10,Enjoyed the movie but very overhyped. Didn't think that much of killmonger. Didn't get the see black panther nearly enough.
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2020,9/10,"I have to be honest, the amount of 1* reviews is a sad indictment of America, rather than the film. As a non-US reviewer with no racial prejudice, I could enjoy the film for what it is, an extremely deep and highly enjoyable action flick. For me, the best film of the MCU, narrowly edging out Ragnarock. Ignore the blatant racism in the reviews and trust the critics. It's fantastic."
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,10/10,The movie has a political message using history of colonialism in Africa as a guide that is presented in a fictional setting. Good lesson for a people with an open mind.
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,3/10,"As a big fan of MCU, this was the worst MCU movie made. Easily. I don't understand the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Simple, Marvel's best movie last three years for shore."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2020,5/10,"One of the weakest, stupidest movies I've ever seen.There are so many gaps and mistakes in almost every thing, such as the story, the plot and the scenarios.The case and history of African Americans and Africans generally deserve much better than this, especially the dialogues.Why don't they at least speak with the same accent if they must speak English. Why don't they speak at least individually with the same accent in all the scenes, like the king for example. He was changing his accent in every second scene.My 5 stars are only for the great work of the graphic designers."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,10/10,"Okay I don't know why people are hating on this movie so much. I found it to be a genuinely amazing film, unlike any I'd ever seen before. So what if it's not like any marvel movie you've seen before? That was the point with the mostly black cast. If I see one more post about how Andy Serkis had the best character I may scream. This movie is fantastic and all the bad reviews completely missed the point of this film. Best movie I've seen in a long time."
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,10/10,"Great for our generation. Great to be able to see our people pre-trade in this light. ""Wakanda Forever!!!!!"""
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,4/10,But with special effects. Very disappointing. Probably the worst Marvel movie next to the frequent murdering of Spider-man
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2019,1/10,THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER WATCHED!!! I COLDN'T END IT
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,1/10,"Sorry, I have to review 1 star to counter the overhyped & paid reviews.
Ragnarok is far far more entertaining, interesting, and has much better story telling, visual integration than Black Panther. Black Panther is just everything average, nothing special, nothing over expection, you can see the end when you starting watching the first minute.So if ragnarok rated 7.9, this one should be below 6."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,3/10,"And the Black Panther makes no sense. He's a PANTHER (a color not a species). So he should have cat like skills. Not throwing electronic gadgets onto vehicles and such. He should have stealth, strength and great senses like an ambush predator would. The excruciatingly long history of the past before any real action had already lost me before I gave it a chance to become good, I admit. I fell asleep, so my review isn't entirely fair. BUT, one should not be so bored at a Marvel action flick."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,10/10,Finaly African super hero movie! Well done marvel studio
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"It was alright,nothing special,it was just alright,visual and sountrack were good,story was pretty generic with no unexpected twists"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Yes, best MCU movie to date & when you think that my previous number one was the exceptional Winter Soldier, that should tell you how how great this movie os in my opinion. Beautifully crafted in every aspect - acting, storyline & action were all stunningly realised - so this was a very easy 10/ 10 for me. Oh & a big shout out to Michael B Jordan for his portrayal of Killmonger....the best Marvel villain to date? I think so"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,"Ahmed Kamala
Black Panther: 6.9/10 (good movie)I was very excited to watch this movie, and because of the reviews I read and heard, I expected very much of this movie. While watching the movie, I kept waiting for it to get better and be more thrilling. I can tell you, judging from a technical and qualitative prospective, it wasn't so good, it was just good. It could have been much better, when you compare it to other superheroes movies, it lacks some important elements.But noticing the values and meanings, which you can't miss because they are focused on, you probably will change your mind about the movie in my opinion. It tells you about how dark and terrible the world we live in is, and that it's our responsibility to make this world a better place, to use what God gave us to help ourselves and others who can't help themselves against the evil they face, and not sit and live in peace where many others die and can't live properly throughout the world. And it talks about racism just by a black man being the hero, and how modern and developed they can be.And that's why it's different than other movies, its inspiration makes it outstanding, and we indeed need more movies to talk about such problems."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,What a beautiful movie! I loved all the angles shot in this movie especially the fight scenes. This movie was great because it showcased a lot of external and internal issues that individuals and nations experience. I love the directors attention to details in Africa ( costumes/belief system) to life in the US....Great feel good movie! Go see it!
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Best superhero movie I've seen since The Dark Knight Rises... certainly the best Marvel superhero movie in my opinon.
Outstanding visuals, acting and script made this an absolute joy to watch.
Michael B. Jordan was an absolutely incredible villain, undoubtedly evil but you couldn't help be charmed by him.
Well done all round."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,10/10,"I have been reading comics since the age of 7 - over 45 years ago - and Black Panther and Luke Cage just happen to be two of my favourite superheroes. 
Back then I didn't know why, but as time went by I looked back and realised that it had a lot to do with the fact that they look like me. 
As a kid, sometimes when I found myself in a sticky situation, I'd get confidence by thinking ""What would T'Challa do""? Well, it worked, and here I am nearly half a century later and seeing a different generation experiencing what I did then, through an updated format I couldn't even dream would have been possible. 
 
Now this movie may not have the best storyline, CGI or acting. However, that is irrelevant to a new generation of kids who are looking for imaginative inspiration. 
So while they will get the real world heroes role models from President Obama to Oprah, they need to see the ones in the world of the imagination as well...and Black Panther steps right into that gap.Wakanda forever!!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 January 2019,4/10,"What's all the hype?
I think there is political diversity intended in this movie.
Kinda boring. And all over the place."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"This is a great film! I went in with high expectation and the movie still met them.This movie is very well directed, and the cast is fantastic, especially Letitia Wright as Shuri, and Michael B Jordan as the villain. The movie has great action, especially during the south Korea section of the film. The movie does a great job of building up Wakanda and making it seem real. Marvel are on a roll right now, and this is genuinley one of their best films. The overrall IMDB score is far too low right now. So, like I said, don't let the review spamming deter you, this is a really great film!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 September 2018,1/10,"Truly as bad a film as I have ever seen, pandering, assaultive and offensive cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,27 November 2018,5/10,With all of the hype and all of the big entertainment names attached to this film I expected it to be much more than average. But I was very disappointed. The plot was average and the acting was stiff and not believable. I was hoping for much more.
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,2/10,I get that they're comic book movies. And I know the MCU movies have some questionable content from time to time. But this was too over the top. Visual effects were pretty good though.
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"Waste of my 3 precious hours in a movie, even in a gold class! From the beginning to the end, full of computer animations, stupid music, useless conversations. Half of the conversations were in African English (which is fine) but the other half was either a highly educated in London living African English or a guy working in a local pizza shop in Harlem (trying to be cool but customer is the king)! Producers tried to copy the Deadpool but failed badly. Bottom line, start a PC game intro and watch it; it is more interesting and at least the music is better!!!! I could even watch Minecraft, even that stupid game would be more interesting to watch! If you have to take your kids to this movie, make sure you send the kids with your partner but you do your best not to be there!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,3/10,"Usually i don't write reviews but the awfulness of this movie compelled me to write one. The movie is over hyped and certainly over rated.
The story-line is typical melodramatic family issue incorporated cling worthy with no detailing is given on character building.Everything is put up in a messed up way, Just VFX can't hold for a nearly 2 hours 30 minutes movie."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,9/10,"It exceded my expectations. I saw some reviews that it was not good, but give yourself the opportunity to see a different MARVEL World."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,10/10,Black excellence at its best on social many levels!!!
BLACK PANTHER,4 April 2018,1/10,"Shallow characters, little or no plot, stunning CGI. I would call it an average Marvel movie. Certainly not in the top 5. Don't know why it's selling so many tickets, except maybe this is the ""year of empowerment"" and it plays to that theme."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,"Black Panther presents outstanding visuals very much in tune with the Marvel cinematic universe. And whilst Director Ryan Coogler does an all-things-considered decent job of bringing a more considered, relevant and thought-provoking tale to the popcorn thrill dominated Marvel film repertoire. He fails in every other aspect. Whilst striving so hard to bring a 'minority' people to the ticket booth - all 2 billion as they say in the movie - he has done a tasteless disservice to white africans, allowing dialogue such as ""colonists"" and ""another white person that needs fixing"" to permeate the film. This somewhat racist leaning language is interspersed by easily the most stereotypical and completely absurd wannabe African accents from actors with no idea how to do it correctly. Compounding this is Hollywood's go-to bad guy in all things African, the big, white, Afrikaans accented man that eventually gets killed, but not before telling how awful the people of an African country are. Capitalising on yet another poor stereotype is the Wakandan's use of armoured Rhinoceroses, because nothing says conservation of an almost entirely extinct species with poor eyesight like strapping armour to it and charging it into battle. 
White guilt with no substance, which is why of course it has been lauded by critics, who know so little of Africa, yet have spoken so much."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,8/10,"Black lives matter on that note the all-new Marvels Cinematic standalone movie came and hit each every record across the globe, with a cast of more than 90% African-American actors this movie stunned entire critics and audiences and proved that there is no supremacy when there is an art to represent, all-new standalone movie was a real piece of art which beautifully represents the entire African culture and colors.
It has taken a decade i.e. 18 movies all the start from Iron Man (2008) - some movies were good and some were average, it really gives an idea that how big road was that for thousands of people who made this journey spectacularly amazing and fun and yet still the Marvels Studios are continuously giving us that amaze face, but now with that all experience the expectations are also increased and I am sure Black Panther certainly proved that they are still the best when it comes to making superhero movie. 
Balck Panther is a film that tells us that as to embrace the future you need to respect that past. So it all begins with a Wakanda, a fictional African nation that was hidden away from the rest of the world due to their rich resource of ""Vibranium "" a meteor that hit Wakanda centuries ago.
It is the home of prince T'Challa who recently faced a tragedy as the King of Wakanda i.e T'Challa's father was murdered in Berlin during Captain America: Civil War movie, the film rightly set after the events of Captain America. And now T'Challa must return to Wakanda to take over the throne and become the rightful heir. This movie is all about the futuristic technology of Wakanda that how they embrace the Vibranium into the day to day life. 
Black Panther was not even a superhero movie for entire one hour. like the other Marvel Standalone movies, for example, Ant-Man or Doctor Strange were concentrated towards a single role or character, but with Black Panther, it was totally different the characters like Nakia, Okoye, Shuri, and Everett Ross shared equally good performance especially Okoye leader of Dora Milaje (special bodyguards of King) and rightfully like other viewers I also demand separate movie or series exclusively for ""Dora Milaje"". So it was basically a group performance which converts simple superhero movie into something special. Some quick cuts between separate scenes were making the film fragile and thus it was taking a time to grasp, only that was the little disappointment in the entire movie. But when it comes to positive note some scenes like the car chase in South Korea, battle scenes of Dora Milage with other tribes were certainly impressive but not impressive as Iron Man 2 Formula one scene or Captain America taking down entire Hydra agents with his shield and fist. But still, the action sequences were really fun to watch.
Like Captain America: Civil War Black Panther was also geopolitical thriller action Movie but more than that it was wonderful CGI movie, loaded with great waterfalls, landscapes, cities and yes huge Rhinoceros also plus they also kept the beautiful African culture intact by adding traditional African tribal background music and the special credit goes to Kendrick Lamar for giving entire music.
The core division of movie was divided into two different thoughts of Black community one was to keep their world safe from the outsiders and another was to fight with clash of cultures, two different homes and burden of their ancestors as to give the proof of their powerful existence, which gives us the thought that the intentions of villain Erick Killmonger were not so wrong as he wants to uprise his community like every villain is the hero of his story.
And thus it's compulsory to talk about ""The Villains"" in this movie like the other Marvels movies villain were practically a joke but in this movie, there were two powerful villains i.e. Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) and Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and both were super badass correct that's the right word of description for the first half Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) totally stole the show it was like that I was watching Heath Ledger but the face was of Andy Serkis and then Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) a proud, muscular, and challenging fighter a right match for Black Panther and that's one of the main reasons why this movie is so special.
And yes if you are die-hard Marvels fan you know you have to wait until the multiplex employees start to stare at you. Know what I mean...!!! 
 Really It was a treat to watch though it was not 100% perfect still beautifully represented a must watch. 
Wakanda Forever..!! ****"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"No doubt that the visuals were stunning and the portrayal of Wakanda was amazing. But as far as a MCU movie goes, Black Panther looked like an another conventional superhero movie which provide very less to entertain the audience or even connect with the character. As a Marvel fan, my expectations were really high for this movie, especially when we are going towards The Infinity War. But all and all 'Black Panther' disappoint me and i think it's better to not watch it on a big screen."
BLACK PANTHER,17 June 2018,7/10,"The cinematography of the film was fantastic. The female actresses were the star of the show. Michael B. Jordan overall performed well, but had some really cheesy lines that were not needed."
BLACK PANTHER,19 January 2019,6/10,"I went into this movie with high expectations and was thoroughly disappointed. After seeing Captain America: Civil War I was excited to see Black Panther get his own movie. Unfortunately they make him weaker and less interesting than in Civil War and use the movie to push intersectional politics. Special effects and villain were top notch though, still lacks action and has other mentioned problems."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,8/10,"Black Panther was all about the supporting cast. Everyone was interesting, everyone had a story or something they could do and they often saved the hero when he didn't plan things through properly. This humanized the characters in some way for me. There's also the very relatable villain, a jealous, unfairly-treated character with a burning temper. He's not a good person and he's not wholly bad. Andy Serkis too makes a great, nasty villain who i not in the film nearly enough.The section of the film that worked best for me was when it felt like a James Bond film, a sequence near that start that is thrilling and well-choreographed and brings us action and technology in a wholly exciting way.Costume design is fantastic throughout and some set-design really stands out, with the look of the Wakandan city as a whole slightly uninteresting and seemingly full of tower blocks you imagine might contain business, yet no one knows this place exists. Likewise the futuristic planes they fly around in are similarly uninspired. But the costumes and street-level views more than make up for this.I recommend this film to anyone who like their action tempered with interesting characters, pretty design and high stakes."
BLACK PANTHER,19 March 2018,10/10,"This movie Was Just Stunning. I'm so proud to have been alive during this time. This is what the world needed. Apart from being a GREAT Marvel film, it was a wonderful step forward for inclusion. It touched on a lot of important issues, while giving me the action I needed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,9/10,"So I loved this movie. I have literally never written a review, but here it goes. Sometimes critics are wrong, but they do have some education that we (the average movie-goer) do not. So for those of you saying the critics suck and the system is rigged- say it with your degree and some actual umph (cuz if you loved Ragnorock and then say the black panther story sucked- you are obviously paying attention to something other than the story). The theme of this movie is very clear and some issues that are really important to our culture were addressed. One reviewer commented the movie does not pull you in emotionally, and maybe that's true. However, I felt really connected to killmonger. I grew up in poverty and I'd be pretty pissed if my family had the option to help and didn't. I probably wouldn't go and try and take over the world, but hey I got the anger (which I can't say for most marvel bad guys). The question of how should a people of privilege help those without will forever be part of humanity. And if you find yourself being particularly hateful toward this movie, you should probably check yourself. Someone said, ""when all you've known is privilege, equality feels like oppression."" If you think this only got ratings and made money because of the racial issues of today- you are most likely wrong. The movie is solid and much more significant to the time we live in than most marvel movies.On the downside the CGI pulled me out of the movie a couple times and it is a marvel movie so it was fairly predictable. Overall this is my favorite marvel movie thus far and probably will stay that way if they keep on the path they are currently on (this is written post-infinity war)."
BLACK PANTHER,24 October 2018,,"I watched it and was floored at the ridiculousness of this. It's every clich√© from all the other superhero movies from the last ten years buuuuuut it's based in Africa. Next will be China. Basically there's a country with no immigration, that frowns on intermarriage with outsiders, and with a technology-based wall around it to prevent outsiders from getting inside (yup) that somehow becomes the most highly-advance country in the world where everyone is as smart as Tony Stark but most people still choose to live in huts while the monarchy lives in a palace and no one resent this. Whenever someone else discovers the secret, the military (all female, of course) gently gets the outsider to keep the secret. Despite THEIR poverty, the outsiders agree to let the wealthy Wakandans keep their secrets and their wealth while the outsiders continue to live in poverty. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created a guy in a spandex suit fifty years ago who was athletic with elevated strength (not super). Now BP is basically wearing a suit of armor (like the new Spider-Man) that absorbs energy and sends it out again and uses gadgets like Batman and Iron Man. The new production team decided to cobble together all the witty banter and clich√©s from the last ten years and package it as something new. Sorry but this was one of the most underwhelming superhero movies since any of the Fantastic Four or X-Men films."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,This movie was Great! The best Marvel movie I've seen. Lots of action and culture! The message behind the movie was inspiring. I will definitely watch it again!
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,1/10,I don't even know if this should be classified as a movie. After living overseas and experiencing the African culture for myself I can tell you that this is the most indirect representation of the African culture that could exist.The movie is filled with ridiculous scenes created by African AMERICANS whom don't even have a clue what their culture is like. It's not about wearing the African traditional outfits equipped with your multi million dollar diamond studs and dancing on cliff sides like some sort of animals who live in caves.The black panther is a great addition to the comic series of any sort. But this movie butchers the minds of so many.I'm literally lost trying to explain myself as to how STUPID this movie is. The ratings are obviously not real as if this movie got an 8/10. I don't think so !
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,1/10,"The only good thing is I didn't take my grandkids to this... I'd never get them to another movie.. shallow characters, out of context one liners. Little or no storyline and talk about stereotypes!!! Lion King meets Masai and a bad date. I started laughing 10 minutes in and felt bad for those expecting a fun entertaining hero movie.. nope. The political drop ins missed their mark sad just sounded Hollywood foolish!!! Disappointed"
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,6/10,"I liked the Black Panther Character in Civil War, and the fact that he was a conscientious character made him even more respectable. The movie didn't add much. His sister was far more interesting, and far more capable in terms of technology and innovation. Killmonger was merely a racist murderer who needed to be put down regardless what kind of childhood he had. What we go through doesn't remove our personal responsibility, which the writers seemed to be pushing, that because he suffered tragedy and had a hard childhood, he was somehow to be excused for his criminality. Criminals choose how to act and how to react to their circumstances, and no amount of victim-hood propaganda is going to change that.When it came down to believe-ability and urgency it just didn't hold water. Killmonger's taking the Wakanda tech to conquer the world for the black supremacists would have been dealt with by the same people Black Panther fought with in Civil War. Just send in the Hulk and Thor. Dr. Strange would have Killmonger locked away in some endless loop for eternity.Overall, as my subject states...it's entertaining, but not the best Marvel superhero movie ever. Thor Ragnarok was funnier, had more action, more urgency and far more believe-ability."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"The fact that the film's rating continues to climb despite the organized efforts to bring down it's rating is a testament to how good this movie really is. I went in fairly skeptical - I'm not into comic books and am not familiar with the Black Panther series at all. I also haven't seen Creed or Fruitvale Station so I'm not familiar with the director's work. As we were stepping out of the theater I was almost speechless, the best I could say at the time was ""there are a LOT of things I loved about that.""The first thing that came to mind at the time, was the wonderful portrayal of Shuri by Letitia Wright and she's a good place to start...As the plot is being constructed, shortly into the film, we are introduced to King T'Challa's younger sister, the brilliant Shuri in a role that defies all the typical 'nerd girl' cliches (she's self assured in all ways, enthusiastic to the point of exuberance,and completely ready to take the fight on herself) - she takes her brother on a tour of her lab showing him all the new tools and inventions she's come up with to help on their mission - the scene is an unabashedly loving take on the classic ""Q and Bond"" sequences from James Bond. 
The Bond feel then carries over into the next scene in a South Korean casino, which culminates in the best choreographed fight scene to date in any Marvel film. 
This then carries into a car chase sequence that continues to pay reference to Bond - in just the first viewing I caught references to both Brosnan and Moore era films in the car chase alone. Outside of that aspect of the filmmaking, every other aspect of this movie is also very nearly perfect;
The world of Wakanda is so well built and the supporting characters are so much fun and so well done I could see this being the foundation of a long and varied franchise. I can think of three spin-offs I'd love to see. 
The overall storyline is the most original to date in the Marvel Universe - especially for a 'tentpole' film.
The villain, Michal B Jordan, is one of the most menacing and yet fully realized villains for Marvel - it's been said that the villain is the hero in his own story and this couldn't be more true than in this film. 
The dialog is fast, brilliant, and daring.The final words spoken by Michael B Jordan, towards the end of the film, are the heaviest, darkest and most meaningful words spoken in any of these Marvel films. The line is so raw and honest and devastating I forgot I was watching a Disney-produced comic book film. This is an exceptional film - ignore all the phony reviews here, give up preconceptions or misplaced feelings of being 'left out' of a 'black movie'. The pitiable and ineffectual racists who feel the need to blast this movie without seeing it are perhaps the ones who need to see it the most."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,Went today with my son. Expected to see the perfect movie based on flawless reviews.Was completely bored. It seems to me like the reviews were fawning over the blackness of the cast rather than the actual quality of the movie.If you want to signal your virtue - go spend $14 on this movie.If you want to see a good move - see Three Billboards. Saw it yesterday and loved it.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"Movie has a bit of everything for everyone from the music and the amazing cast, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan as well as the whole female cast were excellent. Really wanted more Killmonger, the screen time he did have was satisfying enough. They all rose above the need for constant action in a superhero film and actually carried the film well instead of the other way round. It was beautiful and grabbed me from beginning to end. Marvels greatest score so far? I Think so. I had been looking forward to Black Panther ever since I saw the first concept for his costume and it did not disappoint. Glad to hear it could do $200+ Million opening weekend just to show these people hate will not stop this movie from being successful. We will combat your hate with Love and our wallets to show you the world will not be any scarier when Black Panther is a successful movie. Bring on Infinity War and Black Panther 2 +"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,Veered away from classic marvel. It was interesting.
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"Remember the times Marvel makes movie 1-2 times a year, we liked that movies we even liked transformers but today its not about good or bad its all about money. Nothing can stop marvel movies or Michael Bay. Yes this is same thing"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"Do not go to this movie tired or you will fall asleep! If you enjoy a highly predictable plot, awkward character personalities, no background on characters, boring fight scenes, subpar visual graphics, & long strung out movies, then the Black Panther is for you! The black panther appears to be a distasteful mix of Iron Man and Batman with a splash of cat woman and wolverine that flat out does nothing ""cool"". The popularity of this movie is being derived from social issues in our culture today. The Black Panther does a wonderfully awful job at bringing cultures together but rather tears them father apart. DO NOT waste your money like I did. You're Welcome."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,4/10,"High expectations based on media buzz and reviews. After seeing this, I really wonder who would like it. African Americans? Are they not very sensitive to stereotyping nowadays? I felt ashamed at times watching this and really wonder how it can have gained such high scores."
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,6/10,"This was a completely adequate action film filled with a wonderfully talented cast. I can't help but believe that without the hype (to no fault of the film) and the fact that the moral of the story was beating me over the head from 15 minutes on I would have left the film as enthused as my simple minded friends. Definitely worth the Redbox, but don't bother going to theaters now. I don't typically fancy myself a marvel fan but this ranks at the top of the heap amongst the best of the rest."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"Right out of the gate, one of my favorite features of this film is how vibrantly colorful it is. So many of the MCU movies (and action movies in general) have a pretty dull color scheme with only the occasional pop of color. I enjoyed the large range of colors and patterns on display.I liked that most of the plotlines in the movie focused on personal relationships, and that so many of them were familial. T'challa and Shuri's interactions were adorable.Killmonger was an incredibly compelling and multi-dimensional villain.The various interactions between Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye were wonderful. Their personalities and personal relationships with each other felt fleshed out.The score for Black Panther was absolutely amazing.There were only two things that bugged me:1- Some of special effects did not look good and were in my opinion pretty noticeable. Such as, during T'challa's initial coronation ceremony, the crowds of people standing on the cliffsides didn't really blend well with the background. Several of the times that people got thrown during the final big fight scene weren't great either. etc.2- I with they had shown or said what the consequences were for W'Kabi's actions. I would have liked to know if he was in prison (I assume so), if the people that followed his charge were jailed or not since they were just following his orders (since I got the feeling they would have followed his orders regardless of if they agreed and if they would be punished accordingly or if would be less harsh since it would be seen more as fulfilling their duty to follow W'Kabi.). Regardless of what happened to W'Kabi, I would have also like to see if there would be any hint of a chance for redemption since he had such close relationships with several of the main characters.Regardless of these complaints, they weren't enough for me to knock off a star."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,2/10,"Today I have watched Black panther 3D and totally disappointing. I had a pretty high expectation about this film. Only because of it is certified fresh of rotten tomatoes. But after watching, I realized it is overrated garbage. This movie story plot is too weak and so common and predictable. This movie has nothing to see. I like black panther but I hate this film. Totally disappointed and wastage of money. I gave it 2 star only because of some funny dialogue and some action scene."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,10/10,"Honestly don't have any idea where the hate is coming from or how anyone can bypass all the glory that this movie offers. This movie was spectacular. Saw it 2x and it's even better the 2nd viewing. I see a lot of average movie going fan boys looking for a certain atmosphere that very familiar in the other marvel movies and yet are unaware that this film breaks all of that with food reason. After seeing some of the mixed reviews it's VERY CLEAR that these so called Marvel fans don't read comics as much as they say. Particularly with Black Panther. This movie does does no set ups for sequels or other movies. (Unless u wait for end credits) It strictly holds its own as a solo superhero movie. And of course it speaks to black audiences like no other before it. So obviously NOT EVERYONE will relate to the allegorical messages. However, unless you've been living under a rock, those same messages SHOULD help you understand the perspectives. It's not convoluted nor complex in it's narrative. And I must say.....THE.....BEST....VILLAIN.....EVER. Yes Loki can take a seat. Kilmonger was vicious, dangerous and........relatable. As well as the rest of the cast. Phenomenal job with everyone. Ladies......you killed it!!!! This movie has indeed set a new bar for marvel and I hope they press foward and take notes with what they did with BP. Great job."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,1/10,"Badly written, weak story which was poorly executed by sub-par directing. Actors did a very good job though.
After all the rave reviews by critics, I was pumped and ready to enjoy the latest release from the franchise, only to be let down and wondering how on earth it was rated as high as it did. There is sometimes a disconnect between the reviews from the Almighty Critics, and the general public with certain movies, but this is the worst example I've ever seen. I wish I would have read more comments from regular people before I wasted my money."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,6/10,"Perfect effects. 
great costumes
great sound
terrible story! really, come on... 
i actually didn't care who's gonna die, the good guy or the bad guy.
just wanted this ridicules story to end....
maybe the worst movie EVER of marvel.
too bad."
BLACK PANTHER,10 August 2018,2/10,"This was hyped hugely, and my boss at work asked everyone to go and paid for our tickets --- (minority sensitivity awareness?). The hype led me to predict that it would provide some wisdom about reconciliation, avoiding and resolving conflict throough communication and mutual understanding, etc. ----- but ----- NO, it's just another movie about we are the good guys they are the bad guys, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS A GOOD THING, so we, the good guye kill, conquer the bad guys. I can say with much sarcasm: ""Just what we (African American community, world community in general need ---- yet another shoot-em-up, beat-them up, kill the evil ones --- end of story. Funny thing is that, in real life each side feels sure taht THEY are the ""good guys"", so essentially simply a matter of communicating and discovering the common ground."
BLACK PANTHER,13 October 2018,9/10,"Fantastic movieI'm not a reviewer, but I'm a huge fan of the MCU... this adds so much, it's crazy.Gonna go spoiler free ... The history, the guilt, the tech, the future ... I'm very exited going forward into the MCU.This is a great film, please ignore the ones and twos ... it's BS. I think I know the motives, but it's not even worth mentioning."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2019,9/10,"Eric Stevens aka Killmonger is the anti hero. He has a legitimate complaint. The underlying plotline is ""what will T'challa do for the people of color around the world"" He has a game changing resource that would.....wow! Be so on point! On the surface It was a story told many times. In reality it asks a question that tugs at morals. In this ""movie reality"" it answers the question, it was cathartic."
BLACK PANTHER,22 October 2018,1/10,"For what I was told was going to be the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time... kinda underwhelming. Or extremely, because the movie really wasn't good at all. Watch Logan or Deadpool for the 10th time instead. The only thing surprising about this movie is why so many people think it's good."
BLACK PANTHER,26 June 2018,10/10,"I love the marvel movies, but this one has them all beat. It's visually stunning, has some of the most interesting characters and badass women warriors ever! More than that though, I loved the underlying issues of race in our culture that they wove into the story and the strong and scientifically savvy women characters. It's action packed, beautiful and deeper than most movies - comic book derived or otherwise."
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2020,10/10,Amazing By far the best marvel movie.WonderfulWatched it over and over and over again
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2019,3/10,"This was not a bad comic book movie, one of the weaker Marvel movies. Michael B Jordan is terrible in this movie. His acting is the worst of any actor in all of Marvel's movies. This movie did not deserve the attention it received, I hope Marvel realizes this and makes better casting decisions for the next Black Panther Movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"I made an account just to review this movie because I think it is worth the hype. If you haven't seen the numerous other Marvel movies, fear not. Black Panther stands on its own, and doesn't feel like an episode in a series like many of the other Marvel films. Most of the film takes place in Wakanda, an African dreamland that is both traditional and futuristic. When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will. The set design, costumes, and especially the music of Black Panther make it a joy to watch. I highly recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,10/10,"Hands down the best Marvel movie ever , so exciting. The cast was beautiful, the storyline great for the Black panther.. can't wait for the sequel!!! I can see why it's continuing to break records"
BLACK PANTHER,20 April 2020,5/10,"This is probably the worst Marvel movie I've seen so far. Absolutely overrated, the story was just ok and actor's performances nothing special imo.
I'd call it the most boring of Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,10/10,"I can't even put into words how important, poignant, and incredible this movie is from the representation to the real parallels and even the storyline and cinematography. Amazing."
BLACK PANTHER,29 August 2020,1/10,"Total crap not worth ya time, how can anyone rate this movie???"
BLACK PANTHER,6 December 2018,1/10,"I honestly don't get the hype, even for Marvel this was a poor film. Rubbish CGI, wooden performances, dull story. Waste of two hours"
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"Positives:
Great Action scenesGorgeous shots, costumes and effectsGreat acting performancesNegatives:
Characters aren't the most interestingStory rather predictable for action movies
Overall a decent movie. If you are a marvel movies fan and like action movies
you will enjoy your time with black panther. If you are not then this might not be your movie."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,1/10,"Is the most disappointing Marvel movie I have ever seen, had to turn it off about 40 minutes in."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,8/10,"Guys, I don't understand how the ratings are 1 and 3's I thought we were done with all that last year. For the first time in a long time I'm so happy of how they portrayed the character story in the MCU. The black panther was Lmost everything I dreamed of in a movie. The cinematography and the story line almost made me cry tears of Joy. I watched this movie and it's so hard to explain myself without talking about some scenes. There was just something to hold on to for every scene and all you could do was bold your breath. But I'll hold it in. I liked the fact that Chadwick boseman did an extremely good Job, and most of the casts. But I really didn't want to see Michael B Jordan in the movie cast. *I don't know why, but I feel there was something about him that didn't add up. (The forced Black American thing).
I would have prefered someone else. E.g the doctore from spartacus, or someone of that nature but I guess its because of the story line and all. Anyways, it's a 9.8 for me."
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2018,2/10,"Over the top effects , technology, hype 
What the H marvel
It would've been better if it was a base underground or something but no they are in almost what looks like another dimension a highly advanced people who still use spears ???? 
The only cool thing marvel done was the accent."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2021,8/10,"I am a bit late to watch this movie but was positively taken back by the themes explored. Must admit the character development was lacking but maybe our expectations of marvel films are too high (how could black panther compete with another franchise that have 3+ movies already?) I found it extremely refreshing how the movie is based on the theme of colonialism. Yes it may be more politically charged than other marvel movies but surely it's just exploring what has happened/been happening. Superhero's can be black, Asian, minorities- this movies gives so many children around the world the freedom of imagination and I am so happy for it. The visuals are incredible, costume, language depiction, cultural references all amazing. Definitely recommend this to anyone- also I DO NOT UNDERSTAND 1 star reviews?"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,One of the best of Marvel Studios after Captain America: The Winter Soldier
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,1/10,"I was looking forward to watching this film since Civil War, but this was a huge disappointment. It was boring and the acting was garbage... one of the worst Marvel entries in a while."
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2018,10/10,Special effects and story was amazing. This was a great movie. Acting was super and story line was good
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"Frankly the plot and the characters could not be concentrated on because of the so called ""music"". I have enjoyed the soundtracks of past marvel movies but this, this was unbearable. The fact that this is being lauded as a ""movement"" and a great movie is ridiculous. Even if you liked the atrocious music it is at best a middling film. The plot was predictable and some of the characters were flat. I sincerely hope that movies will not be made in this vein again."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"I watched all the hype before the movie, and wasn't really sure what to expect from it. I thought i would go and see it just to support the cause. But the shock i got!! It was really good!!! They did justice to the characters. The acting was brilliant!!!! The fighting scene could have been better, but i dont even watch the fighting scene in movies, I typically just look at my phone till they are done. So i didn't mind. Will definitely see it twice! And if i'm being honest, I probably could connect to it so much because I am African."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2019,9/10,"I genually enjoyed this movie a lot. The music was really spot on and after the movie had ended, I was left with positive vibes and a smile on my face. The script itself was mediocre but the reason why people love this movie is not its script, it is the whole experiece of ""Wakanda""."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"A lot of reviews seem to start off with the hype of this movie but if you're going to judge a movie on the 'hype', you're bound to be disappointed in every single movie. This movie is aesthetically beautiful with truly entrancing story telling. Each actor in this film did a phenomenal job and the portrayal of African-American culture melded with African culture was an approach that most movies would shy away from. A close to home narrative with a futuristic twist was perfectly pulled together by the spectacular diversity. This is a movie that everyone needs to see and I personally will see again and again."
BLACK PANTHER,14 October 2018,1/10,Another Hollywood political correct BS film. This film could/should have been so good but instead of developing characters and the story line they were to busy blaming the white man for all black people's troubles. People of all colours have been slaves throughout history.
BLACK PANTHER,20 June 2018,9/10,"Different cultural backgrounds are rarely explored in popular American films. The topic of religion is also almost always avoided, but Black Panther does not shy away from these themes. The African culture was beautifully portrayed in this film, and instead of it being included as an afterthought, the longstanding African traditions and ceremonies are what specifically help to propel the plot forward. Yes, the ceremonies were obviously exaggerated for the plots sake, but it is still refreshing to see them drawing this much inspiration from a country we have not been seeing enough of."
BLACK PANTHER,9 August 2019,5/10,"The first 1/3 of the movie looked promising, whilst new characters, plot points and beautiful designs were introduced. Afterwards it turned into a snoozefest due to proving out to be as predictable as possible. From 1/3 onwards you know exacty what will happen next, which role each character plays, what will they do and how it all will end. It took me a few takes to finish watching the movie, felt like a waste of time. That film's named ""Black Panther"", but it could have been about anyone and anything, so safe, cliched and predictable it is. Such a pity."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,10/10,"Afrofuturism ftw. Not every movie needs to contain a white savior or a white protagonists. Very fresh genre of SciFi, great characters, amazing antagonists, and it is very much a part of the Marvel Universe. Saw it recently again and I still love it."
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2018,3/10,"Unfortunately not deserving of the hype.
Plot was poor, acting mediocre, effects were good, it was visually pleasing. but after watching this I was feeling disappointingly numb. Maybe I was missing something. 
At the beginning It was reminiscent of Coming to America with glimmers of the Lion King. 
Let's hope they sort it out for the sequel:)"
BLACK PANTHER,28 September 2018,6/10,"This movie has many 1 and many 10 star reviews. I don't feel that it justifies either of these two scores. This movie was far from horrible, yes some of the CGI was pretty yucky, the story was decent. Would I go out and buy this movie? No but I wouldn't have any problem watching it off of Netflix / HBO etc.. It is an enjoyable action movie and Ill leave it at that."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,10/10,"How lovely to see all black cast for the most part. There is only one race ""The Human Race. All are beautiful and talented in their own way. I would love to see more diversity in Hollywood more Asian , Hispanics, Middle Eastern etc. Just focus on talent and not skin color. I am Hispanic and not many on TV and film. Maybe I need to write my own super hero movie. LOL!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"Just came back from the cinema watching black panther in the UK. I have to say, the film was absolutely fantastic! Loved it! I go to Vue/ Odeon cinema in Manchester to watch pretty much all the films that come out and not once have I seen the cinema room so packed before :scream: It's pretty obvious that Black Panther is heavily influenced by the African culture, from the language to the clothing and so on. The message behind the film was well written! Man, after walking out of that cinema I have never felt more pound to be an African! I am defiantly going for a re-watch! Worth the cash!Although I have to agree with some of the reviews, the storyline was a little predictable and generic. However, other than that the acting in the film was phenomenal! You can obviously tell that each actor has put so much effort in their performance. I say if your a little curious on the film, definitely go and watch. Gather your own opinions on it, as the film itself does offer a lot."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"Not sure what all the hate is for on this movie, but I enjoyed it. Is it the best Marvel movie of all time? Not at all, but it was a different kind of Marvel movie that was interesting in it's own way. Yeah it was a little bit too predictable at times and that is the only reason why it is getting an 8 star rating. When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out a bunch of people thought it would flop, and it ended up being one of the best Marvel films of all time, and that's what viewers should think the same because it was a quite delightful film. Good story, memorable characters and stunning visuals. Plus a lot of these reviews say that it's political and that is a huge negative, there is nothing political about it. Makes me kind of think some people used multiple or rogue accounts to leave bad reviews. Go see this film!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,4/10,..Disney-maniacs thinking?! If this movie really gets nominated in a serious category I'm gonna eat my sandals.
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,1/10,"I didn't see it in theaters. I bought it on 4K when it was release. After seeing Civil War, I thought Black Panther to be bit of a bad ass. After watching it, all I kept waiting for was something to happen. Never did. It was the most boring Marvel movie I ever seen. Its make me look forward to an all day marathon of the Fantastic 4 and Hulk movies, it was that bad. I understand about this being some amazing 1st African American super hero (Blade and Spawn were so much better than this and Spawn was horrible), but Marvel couldn't do better than this. I stopped myself 6 times from turning it off thinking it would get better. Sorry. Maybe they will get Black Panther 2 better but not this first outing"
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,10/10,"From the beginning, this movie have nearly 20,000 reviews before the movie even came out. Most of them negative. Blame it on DC Fanboys or blame it on internet cowards who like to stir the pot of racism. Box office numbers prove that it was well received. It is disheartening to read some of the negative comments because you can tell they were racially motivated. Some people complained about dialog that wasn't even present in the movie. When the reviewers can't probably write a coherent 500 word essay. Others stated that Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman had the best performances. (Both of whom are favorites of mine) This movie was about both the Africans and African Americans and how that relationship was strain due to the middle passage and diaspora of African Americans. It is a story about a Prince who is transitioning into King yet has to struggle with the truth of the sins of his father. That struggle manifests itself with Killmonger. Killmonger obviously represents African Americans, while obviously T'Challa does the same for Africans. Killmonger has a hatred of ""colonizers"" because of the oppression A.A. around the world outside of Wakanda. While T'Challa had a mistrust of colonizers from what was done to the people on the continent of Africa.It is okay to not like the movie if it is for true and authentic reasons, but when you don't like it because of your biased towards people of color and you unfairly rate a movie is just ridiculous 1920's way of thinking. There was also a person comparing the Jabari tribe to the Fraternity Omega Psy Phi, inncorrect and please read the comic. They were the Ape tribe and Ryan Coogler decided to not call M'Baku Man Ape (for obvious reasons that A.A's have been called monkeys for years) after the character he was portraying. All I ask is that people give an honest review, not biased by race or misogyny or hate. We support movies that cast mostly white people, we just ask you to learn understand and respect one of ours."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"Although I see a lot of people writing bad reviews based on the opinion that it was ""over hyped"", to me, this film exceeded the hype. I would consider myself a pretty average superhero fan, holding Marvel movies to a basic standard of good action, fun dialogue, engaging plot and thought out characters. This movie easily checks off all of those categories, while bringing others into the spotlight such as stunning visuals, well developed world building and lore, diversity in casting, thought provoking villains and complete badass-ery. As much as I can rant and rave about this movie, I noticed one critical flaw. There's a point in time where the writers decided to force the rotting corpse of a dead meme down the audience's throats that really took away from the atmosphere. Not one person in the theatre laughed, while lots were groaning in disappointment. 
Black Panther has it's own quirky dialogue between characters that counts as ""fun"", but if you enter the theatre hoping for Antman, Avengers or Guardians, you will be let down. Try and appreciate the movie's more serious tone as they tackle heavy topics such as classism, racism, segregation, globalism, terrorism, and many other ""isms"" worth addressing on the big screen. They do all this, without making the movie feel like a college lecture, but an entertaining superhero flick. Ultimately, Black Panther gets all of the right kinds of conversations started. To me, this movie outshone the spotlight, raised the bar for all other superhero movies, dropped the mic and left me speechless. I don't want to go into much detail so as to prevent spoilers, but let me leave it at this: you NEED to see Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I normally don't go to see movies on opening night. But we got our tickets two weeks ago because I wanted to see this one right away. The previews looked amazing. It didn't disappoint! If you watch ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" than ""Captain America Civil War"" then go see this. They flow together just right. These three work as a whole especially if you remember to watch all of the end credit scenes. By the way this one has the standard two at the end so sit tight! The 3D FX made the movie pop and are worth the extra ticket cost."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,2/10,"What needed work:
There are no accidents in the characters which the writers portrayed in this film. Once you see that each character in the film is illustrating a piece of the modern race conflict narrative, you can't unsee it, and for me---it soured the an otherwise great plot & movie. Erik Killmonger's words near the end, ""Throw me into the ocean with my ancestors"" pointed to a lamentable world of self-pity that so many live in today, and demonstrated a great disrespect for the value of life. It made me sick to my stomach that the directors chose not to redeem his character in any substantial way in the denouement of the movie. Take a moment and ask of the screenplay writers, ""What message are you trying to communicate through Erik's despair of life itself?"" Is the answer for the modern black male to simply ""give up""?? Isn't it rather to rise up, and above one's situation? So----why not allow Erik to work through the issues, and see past the history, and into a brighter future? Lastly, racially charged terms were an unfortunate addition to a superhero movie. 
""Dumb farmers"" ""Colonizers"" ""Slaves"". Just don't go there. It added *nothing* to the movie for me to hear these demeaning terms.What I liked:
Extremely high quality acting throughout... AMAZING choice of talent. I love how the underlying values of Enlightenment, Community and working together came through very strong in the film. I loved how the final scene back in Oakland, California with the boys playing hoops ""bookended"" the opening scene nicely. Great character development throughout. Moments of imminent peril were grabbing, but glimmers of hope breaking through provided relief at every turn."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"This movie can have a different effect depending on what preset you have for seeing it.It is far from being the best story in the Marvel universe, true. However the characters were developed rather well, the action scenes were amazing, the visuals were simply amazing and they actually did good on the cast.The acting was good. Not the best, but good. I particularly enjoyed the balance between serious moments and jokes. Far better done than some of the other Marvel movies.It was easy to watch, enjoyable as an experience, there were several absolutely beautiful and touching scenes. This is why I'm giving it an 8. I did enjoy this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 April 2019,1/10,Having not seen all of the marvel movies I am watching all of them in in chronological order and this is the only one that has made me want to write a review. All the others have been thoroughly entertaining. With the hype i expected this to be one of the best. It is terrible and doesn't make any sense compared to the others. You have to watch it if you're a marvel fan but download some games on your phone for when you do!
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"JUST SAW THIS ITS ABSOLUTELY MIND BOGGLING HOW CULTURE, POLITICS, AND ALL OUT BADASSERY CAN AMALGAMATE INTO ONE 2 HOUR MASTERPIECE. A MUST SEE."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"Let me start out by telling you I am not a fan of Captain America and rate those movies maybe 3-5. I do like Iron Man and so desperately wanted to like Black Panther. I am a huge fan of Michael B. Jordan, he was phenomenal in Chronicle and Creed. The story and plot just don't sell me, I mean seriously a secret technological civilization hidden for centuries? My question is where was this advanced civilization when Loki was taking over and when Ultron was set to destroy the earth? No logic! 
The special effects where good, but I feel that's all it had going for it and I would have liked to see Michael B. Jordan beat Black Panther, I would prefer him King over T'Challa.The only good Marvel movies are Thor, Iron Man, Dr Strange and Avengers, the rest...Meh! Black Panther, Ant Man and Captain America have too similar plots in context and rely too much on CGI. So Does iron Man but RDJ has the persona to make most people like it. Sorry I would give Black Panther a 9 for special effects but with a plot that's been done over and over again, just didn't set well with me. Maybe it would have been better if the media would not have hyped it up."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,9/10,It was great good speacial effects and the plot was good
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,3/10,"Embarrassingly bad. The political hype machine holding idiosyncratic beliefs or impressions that the average joe will like something because they demand you to like it . How much did the ""professional"" reviewers services cost in exchange for all these positive online write-ups .The movie was Garbage! Say it how it Really is."
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,9/10,"If you saw this movie just now (like me) and wanted to see what other people think about this movie you should not read any of these reviews because they are not really what people think, they are made on anger from people with very high expectations that were made by high advertising. Don't hype your expectations on anything being a date, a project, a party, a movie because if it dosen't go as you planned it in your head it will crush you from the inside and will filll you with anger and dissapoinment.
This movie was great from my point of view(great flashy scenes to increase my dopamine level from a primate point of view, some new cinematic filming, cool characters that caried themselves around just fine), but some things we're just a little wrong like poetic fighting, lack of acting etc.
I'm not a specialist in cinematography, fairly young by age but i loved every Marvel movie made by now and i think they all delivered what we all wanted."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"The actors won this movie for Marvel! Each actor brought their A game! Granted, love the ladies and gentlemen in the back room with all their cool CGI coupled with the actors and (stunt people) but, I didn't feel overloaded by the special effects and gadgetry though when all came together, they made the screen truly come alive!!Can't wait to buy this on HD DVD!!"
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2019,6/10,A very bad movie in general. Poor storytelling. I can't believe It has this rating. It is an easily forgettable movie and Killmonger might be the worst marvel villain after malekith and the frost giants.
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,7/10,I liked the movie but as a audience who loves films and stories I saw a lot political statements/themes in the movie. I expected it but was bit overwhelmed to see in many places which was not my experience with other marvel movies.
BLACK PANTHER,30 October 2018,10/10,"If, there is a country of Africa, technologically advanced from the developed countries of the world - a few decades ahead, keeping themselves hidden from the war by disguising them as an underdeveloped country. Their spies are scattered all over the world, so it is a matter of time only to get the whole world controlled by their better war-arcenal. Such a mythical secret civilization has been developed by Black Panther Movie.After events of Captain America: The Civil War, late 'King T'Chaka' is going to be replaced by his descendant as the rightful owner of throne, T'Challa. Opening up themselves in front of the rising world in order to help fighting against war and poverty, or keeping themselves isolated from the world like his ancestors, which one will he choose?On the other hand, a black orphan child grew up in Oakland with his late father's fairy tale like story of Wakanda, his real home. In lieu of lies, genocide or any other costs, he wants to go back to there. Defeating T'Challa in the challenge to throne, he wants to impose colonialism over the colonizers who have gone through that for ages. So that, like the colonial Britain, the Wakandian Empire, never will see the sunset.The most striking theme of the movie was the highlights of the Wakanda. Africa's ancient culture along with imagined future technology has emerged as an wonder. Productions and costume designs have to be appreciated. And the effects of Africa are also used in the soundtracks. To say, it is a Hollywood tribute for African civilization and culture.This is the first time that black craftsmen dominate Hollywood's big budget movie. Chadwick Boseman in central character and Michael B Jordan's role in the role of villain Killmonger is commendable. Also, last year's Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya has flaunted an important side-role. Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o, Forrest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K Brown everyone is successful in their character. Winston Duke and Latitia Wright in the role of Man-Ape & Shuri respectively were heartwarming.Ryan Coogler, the director, has succeeded avoiding clich√©s and giving new dimensions to the story, along with Joe Robert Cole. By salvaging personal experience and creativity, created a memorable superhero villain, who is hesitant to be called as the so-called evil entity. Having Marvel's time and storytelling restrains, witnessing so complete solo movie like this, was beyond imagination. Though the movie could have taken for more meaning, the movie will still be regarded as one of the best superhero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"If this movie haven't had this much black cast, it wouldn't have got this much hype nor budget success.
Such a below average boring Disney movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 June 2018,3/10,"I had no expectations and I'm still disappointed. Story is so generic a child could've wrote it. Only thing that kept me through were action scenes, which, honestly, weren't even good, nothing I've haven't seen before."
BLACK PANTHER,16 December 2018,1/10,"Absolutely predictable plot, dull actions and poorly developed characters. Don't believe the hype!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,7/10,"It was a good film don't get me wrong but the main reason i didn't really like the film as much as everyone else is because i prefer killmongers character to t'challa. Having a villain like this is only good when you have an established superhero which you already feel emotions for. For example daredevil and the punisher. After watching daredevil season 1 you feel emotions towards daredevil making you always want to support him then with the introduction to the punisher and his origin it creates a choice for you to choose between daredevil and punisher in which morally you would end up supporting daredevil because of the heroism he has already shown. The tough choice you have to make adds some depth and emotional value to the show/film and makes the rest of the film/show more interesting. T'challa has not shown this heroism and sacrifice in the MCU yet. The only appearance was him trying to hunt down bucky for murdering his father. In civil war his role isnt very important and we do not get emotionally attached. t'challa seemed more interested in getting the girl than helping the outside world and takes him the whole movie to realise that he should help. That doesnt seem heroic to me. the origin of killmonger was far more touching and i felt his goals were justified. having your father killed by your own people while you are a child whilst your dad promised to take you back there must have been very hard and the amount of work he put into becoming king shows his motivation. Killmonger wasn't a villain by choice but was made one by the environment of which the wakandans left him in. Leaving him alone in the oppression that he faced was obviously not going to end well. t'challa's reaction to him coming to wakanda was not remorseful but was rude and didn't try to make up for his fathers mistake. it seems very hypocritical as he says something about not judging him on past kings but killmonger already put at a disadvantage due to his father. After beating t'challa, he in my eyes was the true king and for a place that goes on honour and ritual cheating to bring t'challa back by giving him the strength of the black panther doesn't seem right to me. You look at killmonger as a villain but he was only doing what our governments do everyday by giving and selling weapons to keep people oppressed. Meaning all the american superheroes you support are bad. All of this would be great for a sequel because we would have more of a connection to t'challa making us want him to win and question ourselves on the way. But i don't at this point and wasn't happy when t'challa prevailed i just felt disappointed. im not saying i agree with what killmonger was doing i just don't agree with t'challa either."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,3/10,"After a decade of amazing movies, it was quite anticipated. This movie fails to excite even the most hardcore of Marvel fans. It progresses painfully sloooowly....No action scenes...No twists and surprises...No larger than life villains..No memorable character(except Klaue portrayed by Andy Serkis)....And not even the trademark Marvel humor. Nothing."
BLACK PANTHER,18 April 2019,10/10,"I don't know why so many haters reviewed only one star for this but I would say this movie's content is full of twists and turns:
1. Old king vs his brother
2. New king vs his brother
3. Old wakanda vs new wakanda
4. Wakanda people's interest vs the rest of black people's interest on earth
5. Tribe vs other tribesIf people really think into the content that wakanda's core spirit, there are so many things needed to be focused."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,,"I was a little skeptical hearing such great reviews. I didn't have any expectations going to see this movie. 
The film turned out to be great. Stunning visually, sexy and with complex relevant themes. There were some beautiful cultural references in costumes, traditions etc. All characters are fascinating and versatile. While not all the characters are portrayed as comics intended all the characters apart from one - M'Baku were played exceptionally.
But my main praise goes to outstanding black female characters in the movie and actresses portraying them! Not only do they outshine male counterparts they outshine Wonder Woman movie character thousandfold. In my opinion that is. Many great characters but my favorite are Okoye and Killmonger. Well done Marvel!I am hoping that this film will help to invigorate and expand a little stagnant, narrow and outdated range of white-mostly movies and boring and narrow-minded characterizations through clich√©s and stereotyping to create more culturally varied characters and movies."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,2/10,"Really glad to see that not every review was a 10. I just asked out of the theater thinking, ""That was it? THAT'S what everyone was so excited about?"" Not much I can add to all the other reviews other than: Wait for it to come out on premium channels-or at least PPV. $12 x two was definitely too much for nebulous plot with no real direction and a complete dichotomy of technology vs. tribal ritual.If this is a glimpse of the future, Black Panther will never be more than an Avenger sidekick. Ant-Man was more believable."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,1/10,"Just garbage from the first scene. I'm not a big super hero/fantasy fan, but after hearing everyone rave about it I had to give it a shot. I don't understand what they loved about that movie? The awful story? The terrible dialogue? The horrible accents?Garbage garbage garbage... 1/10"
BLACK PANTHER,17 May 2018,1/10,"I honestly don't understand why this movie rating is so high. Story is stupid, CGI is terrible. Worst marvel movie i have seen."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2019,1/10,"Garbage!! No good. Embarrassing!
Skip it not worth watching!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,I really really wanted to give this a nice review going into this movie. But the thing is - it is very dangerous to go watch movies with so much excitement. It just dissapointed me in so many aspects and I dont even want to give an effort to write so much bs for the movie:(
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,4/10,"I was thrilled to watch this movie , so much hype arround it, so many good ratings .
After watching I don't really have much to say . It just didn't match the expectations. Don't think it is a good movie and for someone who really wants to watch, be prepared for the worst."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,6/10,"This film was disappointing not because it was a bad film but because supposedly it was amazing. The story was forgettable and the villains pretty generic. It's not Iron Man II but it isn't in the same league as Guardians Of The Galaxy, Captain America, Spiderman, or Avengers (especially Infinity War). Even Ant Man was better."
BLACK PANTHER,22 January 2019,6/10,The reason movie got so popular because the cast is mostly black. It is a big win for film industry but the film wasn't satisfying and it was boring. It was a cliche superhero movie you could predict what is going to happen next.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,1/10,"I was pretty disappointed in this one, I am usually a sucker for superhero flick. The gadgets/tech ideas were great, but it was downhill from there. While there were a few good acting performances, most were not which was very distracting from the movie. It was really what ruined the movie for me. It also wasn't a great storyline, I can handle that it was pretty predictable, it is a superhero movie. However, it just seemed basic. Just when you thought it might gaining traction and pull you into it, it would just fall flat."
BLACK PANTHER,28 January 2019,1/10,"The critics are totally motivated by politics on this picture. We went with another couple and we all hated it, so disappointed. Visually it's good but what sci-fi movie isn't these days? The acting is terrible, the jokes are not funny, the plot is transparent, written by a third grader! We wasted free passes for this trash! I'm sure it's still not in the theaters but if you find it at one Run Away don't walk!!! I wish I could have rated it -10 !!!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"I am from Portugal and finally i was able to see the movie.I need to write this little review, because i noticed that many users are making fake¬¥s reviews and it¬¥s noticeable that they didn¬¥t saw the movie (see the news about the facebook group that wants to sabotage this movie).Contrary to most people that talked about the action being great (because they thought they could use that to throw people off), the action wasn't as great. Some Shoots were too dark and some scenes had some annoying jump cuts, so overall it was decent to good, and maybe one great action scene. The pacing of the movie was odd at certain times, but nothing that can damage the movie.Very solid acting all over the place, even from minor supporting cast. They were able to introduce some comedy through the personality of some characters organically, and sometimes the females characters took the movie and had great spotlight's, making the main character look like a secondary character.The Villain...oh my, take Loki away, this is the best villain that MCU has right now (for me, even better than Loki). That is very apparent when you can understand and agree at some extent with is point of view. Even when you know his plans will bring chaos to the world, maybe because of his charisma, you want him to win at some extent.Great shoots of Wakanda and great world building.Great Story, with political views, they even manage to give appropriate screen time to all the characters, with essential dialogues and action.I will give it a 8.0/10.It¬¥s definitly a very good comic movie, but i need to see it again, to make a final judgement. Right now, is not better then The Avengers, CA: WS or CA: CW (this 3 are on another level), but i think that from the 18 MCU movies, maybe he deservers the #6 or #7 spot."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,7/10,"Good movie...story was a little weak and dragged at times. Tech stuff was cool. Acting was quite good, except for Jordan who was corny and just plain bad. Action scenes were hectic and overdone, with the opening scene being so dark we couldn't even see what was happening. Worth seeing but on the lower end of the super hero movies."
BLACK PANTHER,25 July 2018,7/10,No this movie isn't the best marvel but still was good and enjoyable. Further character development would've been nice but the originality was a plus.
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,10/10,"Truly an amazing movie, I don't know why it has been rated so low, give it a chance, you'll love it!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,1/10,"The plot sucks, the characters aren't relatable, the propaganda is shoved down your esophagus, and it's not even funny. It's lion king but lion king was two times better"
BLACK PANTHER,27 July 2018,10/10,Black Panther is my Favorite superhero in the MCU. The mostly Black cast of this film is awesome. I like his powers. He will always be my Favorite hero. This isn't the MCu's first Black superhero.
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,10/10,"Although the plot is still very cliche, but I like how they are pushing forward to new heroes. Even though I love those heroes, but what's gonna come will come.And the soundtrack is really good,I downloaded them all in my iTunes.Old heroes are not dead yet, wait for the avengers."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,I am a major super hero nerd. Black Panther satisfied my nerd desires!!! I definitely plan to see it again before it leaves theaters.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Not only is the film visually stunning, but the movie has a great story that keeps viewers interested. Black Panther has a uniquely imaginative setting based on the real strength, riches, and beauty of African civilizations, and introduces it to real events in history, and issues faced by the generation of black youth and others dubbed as minorities even in this modern day. The movie is also loaded with lots of fun action. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the amazing choreography, especially among the gorgeous warrior women. The movie has a rich cast, filled with gifted actors both familiar and new. Anyone would enjoy this movie, but in particular, any black person, of any age could easilly find inspiration and role models in this movie, not only because it has a black hero with a cool suit and neat technology, but also because of his struggles and responsibilities before and after becoming an African King, which I thought were well projected throughout the movie. There wasn't one character in the film who didn't have a strong significance in one way or another, and The Black Panther respected them all, even those who would seek to destroy him... All in all, this is a must see film!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2018,1/10,"This is the first time that i write a review.
I am so dissapointed with the movie that i watched 9 months ago. I feel rage that this movie is considered for awards.
The story doesn't stand out, acting is bad (Chadwick was ok) , the characters are one dimensional, the special effects are on the level from year 1998. People must have watched the movie with closed eyes thats the only possible reason why this has good ratings. I mean how would you else explain so many bad reviews and ratings for this movie if there wasn't something fishy about the movie. The movie is just going with the flow of Black Lives Matter movement."
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,6/10,"I found this movie is too quiet as a marvel movie , I waited for more fights and comedy lines but unfortunately I didn't find any."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,9/10,"Just saw the movie and had a great time at the theaters. Got what i paid for, nuff said. I don't understand all these 1/10 ratings. Troll hatred is strong."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,Symbolic And A Rich Representation. Black Panther Was Everything It Was Always Meant To Be. And Then.. It Was Still More.
BLACK PANTHER,13 January 2019,8/10,"Seems like there are a lot of socially unacceptable thinkers reviewing this... Mad, huh??"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"Imagine having nothing else to be proud of that this is what people would find ""success"" in. This movie is a poor attempt at race-baiting and marvel have shown that they need to appeal to the lowest common denominator. I feel bad for the kids watching this thinking the only place they will win is in a fictional story line. Media is fake news :("
BLACK PANTHER,12 January 2019,8/10,"I'm not a marvel fan and knew nothing of this film beforehand, but I loved it. I loved the African elements, the action, the characters. It did seem a little bit rushed in terms of character development at points, but the plot was steady and didn't drag, well paced action scenes. Overall, one of the better films I've seen this year"
BLACK PANTHER,18 October 2018,3/10,"I watched this with my 24 year old son, expecting a lot more that I got. The only good thing i care to say about this is that it gave my son and I plenty to talk about. We were both disgusted by the movie overall. We both found the characters flawed, the villain especially. Please don't waste your time watching this."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,5/10,"Spoilers coming! I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. I'd felt this way after Spiderman, too; just wasn't enough tension or maybe it was over-hyped. The worst part is that the trailers for this movie revealed the best of the special effects and fights. As the movie went on, the coolest effects were already exposed and that took the wind right out of the sails. Then, couple that with ""Infinity Wars"" teasers that show T'Challa alive and well and interacting with Captain America, we already knew that he was coming out alive and still King of Wakanda. Plus, the later teaser reveals Bucky is hidden in Wakanda; we could easily and safely assume that wherever Cap is, he's not far from Bucky. The politics took more of the steam from this film, too. It had the smell like the Anakin Trilogy from Star Wars (Eps 1, 2, & 3), where we are subjected to an imaginary C-SPAN. The slow downs didn't make the movie as exciting as previous MCU movies.They didn't really tie this one into the MCU as well as others. I could have really enjoyed a couple Avenger cameos here. Plus, they had a prime opportunity to bring them in with the time line being right after ""Civil War"". Now, all that said, I enjoyed the movie overall. I'd watch it over all the DC movies, save Wonder Woman. It was entertaining, the suspense just wasn't there. Maybe, I had built it up too much in my head. Ant-Man and Dr. Strange were two of my favorites not knowing anything about their characters and I hoped Black Panther would do the same. In the end, I was disappointed but it was still worth watching. Here's hoping the next one picks up the momentum of the franchise.TL"
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,7/10,"While other people worry about the rating of this movie SO much they forget what they bargained for: lets stick to context.Marvel Movie! 
It's a comic realisation. And for that the adaptation was A-Ok.CGI was superb. Hey Its Holliwood.
Acting was spot on. I believed every word ( prolly because i just loved the dialect ).
Story was like a roller coaster. Up down Left right. And sometimes: Topsy Turvy.All in All. If ur in for shutting of ur brain for 2 hours and letting getty images, silly lines and a beautifull score rule. U cannot go wrong with this one.And just a note to all the brainiacs that gave this movie 1/10 just to settle the score. No one ever said it would be another Shindlers List or or or."
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2018,9/10,I was not sure who the black panther was as far as a superhero. So me and my son went to see it. We came out say it was a good movie. The cast did a good job playing the part and marking it feel like they were fighting for the world.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,Takes waaay too long to get going and the dialogue and acting is pretty bad.CGI in the fighting scenes is as bad as wonder womens
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"Feels like nothing happens, the story just kind of drags on and on."
BLACK PANTHER,14 April 2018,10/10,"Unfortunately, IMDB allows anyone to review a movie, so here come all the racist trash piles leaving 1 Star ""reviews"" because it's a black superhero movie. Ignore them. It's good. Really good."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,2/10,"By far and away the worst Marvel film since Thor: The Dark World.While I wasn't a fan of the over the top humor of Thor Ragnarok, I can underunder why they went down that path. This is the extreme opposite. The few ""jokes"" that popped up were both unfunny and so very forced. The overall story was just plain boring and, to be honest, I'd be hard pushed to remember 75% of the story 10 minutes after the movie finished. Whilst I can't argue with the acting talent that's on show, the vast majority of them are wasted. Or annoying.The first thing I usually check up on after I watch a Marvel movie is the Blu Ray release date. I can categorically say that I'm really not bothered when it gets released. In fact, I'd be hard pushed to watch it again at all."
BLACK PANTHER,29 January 2019,6/10,"Black panther wasn't good.....the movie was always gonna be set in Africa and people said ""OMG ITS A BLACK CAST!""...of course it would. Its not a bad film but stop treating it as 'the' film to be representative of black culture when its just another OK marvel film with some really good aspects. The action is enjoyable but not believable for the most part besides a horrible end action sequence, the music is different to other marvel films and everyone in the film was fine.Andy Serkis was very entertaining and his performance gave a lot to this film, but besides him everyone else is just fine and does their part. No real interesting or great cinematography or camera work, and besides some stupid shaky cam in the first fight scene all the other action was filmed good enough. The pacing really is slowed down by most dialogue driven scenes being boring and not having any emotional impact, wit or smart writing, but i know what film this is and who it caters too yet i don't think this film knew that and took itself way too seriously.Its still something i can put on in the background and mostly has good effects, besides all the scenes in Africa which felt like they were shot in a studio. Accept this film for being a marvel film and not some politically aware, genre breaking masterpiece.Should of had more knack...."
BLACK PANTHER,4 August 2019,10/10,"This was the best movie of that year. I love all Marvel films and DC as well.
All the characters are well defined and one is not like the other.
Don't even get me started on the cast; great actors who did their job great making me believe that a world like that might in fact exist.üòú
In my opinion this definitely deserves a 10 star review. I watched 3 times already and I sense there will be more. üôÇ"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Movie was better than the exceptation,wakanda is beautiful all actions seen wre good"
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,5/10,"So I watched Black Panther and I can honestly say, It's not THAT BAD. Sure there are predictable moments and what not, but the people rating it 1 star are being so ignorant. There is a decent villain, good solid story, great visuals and humour in the right places. Don't be put off by all of these people giving it 1 star, Its a great film."
BLACK PANTHER,24 July 2018,1/10,"Believe the low ratings here. This movie is by far the worst and most overrated movie of 2018!. You have to buy so much bull s... to feel entertained that it's impossible for most people to view this without thinking that the high reviews must have been because of something else than the story, the acting and all the rest you would think should release an review score of 5. But 7,5 .... WTF!"
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,10/10,One of marvels best works. Builds a grand platform for the upcoming avengers.
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,10/10,Marvel always has very good movies but this was different. It was a top 5 movie ranking in my world.
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,10/10,"Best Movie I've Seen In A VERY Long Time!!!! From Beginning To End It Was Great, The Storyline Was Perfectly Put Together."
BLACK PANTHER,16 April 2020,1/10,Not oscar worthy mediocre movie. The writing was bad . Direction not upto the mark . And cheesy cringeworthy one liner . Basically the whole movie was a disaster and won oscar smh
BLACK PANTHER,29 March 2018,10/10,"Special effects, acting, fight choreography, costume design, story line - loved it all. Sadly, neither I nor any of the group I was with understood the last line of dialogue (after the King addressed the UN). Glad we stayed until the VERY end."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther's Wakanda is much like other countries in the Real World today, thank you for that!Wants to protect and maintain a healthy culture:
Ethno-state No immigration, unless immigrant is proven safeNationalistProtected by walls against evil/undesirable forces"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,The visual affect was good..it was quite anticipated. This movie fails to excite.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,3/10,"For Marvel/Disney to follow up Thor Ragnarok, one of the best films in the MCU, with undoubtedly their worst was a huge let down for me and the family. It's hard to recall a film, especially within the superhero genre, where the bad guys were so much more fun than the main characters. Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis were the only reasons I didn't rate this film one out of ten. Without going into too much detail on the film's faults I'm purely basing my opinion on whether I would watch the film again. Unfortunately I have to say I have very little desire to sit through it a second time in the near or distant future. Whereas all previous MCU movies I'd happily view over and over again.Roll on Infinity War,"
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,6/10,After hearing so much hype about this movie when it came out I finally decided to watch it and I don't see how it's getting all these 9/10 and 10/10 ratings. It's a decent super hero movie but the story telling isn't great and the end fight is full cgi that doesn't even look good. 6/10 is a good rating in my opinion as it's mowhere near the best marvel movie but not the worst either. Hopefully in a sequel they'll make black panther a better movie and give him the awesome solo movie he deserves
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2019,1/10,"Marvel unworthy, proberly high score because the black statement that is not a reason to rate this movie so high. It suck big time beceause of the statement just make a movie not a statement on film!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 May 2018,10/10,"People are saying it's far fetched...a green guy climbing buildings, a man in a flying suit and a ""God"" from another planet are not? I know why they hated it and that's exactly why I love it!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,10/10,"I am not a big fan of action films, but this film was awesome! It was very entertaining and held my full attention. Hopefully their will be a sequel!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,1/10,"I was extremely excited to see this Movie after seeing the IMDB rating and reading reviews. I took a day off work and took my wife to see the cinema. After the first 15 minutes I knew we in for a rough ride.I decided to stick at it, convinced that it would improve, but my worst fears were realised and I was plunged into an ever descending pit of despair. This rating is simply incorrect. Bad acting, bad CGI, terrible plot, atrocious dialogue, and the actors accents are absolutely diabolical. I haven't seen a movie this bad since The Last Airbender."
BLACK PANTHER,25 July 2020,10/10,"Hands down, one of the best movies that have surfaced this planet! Well done to the script writer, cast, actors, director, costume designers, team on set! You guys rock, and all made this movie come together. Black Panther, also a great name for one of the finest movies in this century!"
BLACK PANTHER,1 October 2018,1/10,My friends were so excited to see this movie and i just found it horrible.
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,10/10,"Many negative reviews are pretty much for the same reasons, but if these people posting negative reviews would pay attention to the movie they would understand the story line better. Visuals were pretty good, the acting throws many people off because it's ""AFRICAN ACCENTS"" so the excuse they sound ""robotic"" tells me a lot these guys are used to one type of movie. And for those that say that they felt ""this movie attacked them"" which from what I've seen there was literally one scene where they brought up the HISTORY of what the ""colonizers"" did in Africa. I don't understand how feelings get hurt over facts. Overall it's a great movie, a lot of people think so, I'd definitely see it again. The movie culture is obviously different so I can see how some people can't make a connection to the movie and perceive it as dull. But watching the movie for the movie itself, you'll get a lot more enjoyment out of it"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Firstly I don't know why so many negative reviews. If you are a marvel fan and you like other Marvel Movies, I bet you like this movie. BGM was excellent. While watching the movie, I felt like I was in Africa the whole time, because of the music and characters that took the movie to a new level. Characters played their roles very well."
BLACK PANTHER,4 June 2018,1/10,"Wow. I really wanted this to be a great film. I found it to be cliche and the antithesis of what it could be. What an opportunity to feature a ""minority"" in Marvel Comic's anthology. What a waste. Shamefully horrible."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Masterful job by Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison as well as the entire cast. People complaining of politics in this film are suffering from delusions of their own making. Its a movie about a fictional king in a fictional country. True Marvel fans will know that you can't tell the story of BP without the origins and practices of Wakanda. Anyway, Michael B. Jordan (No relation) plays the realest villain since Magneto. (Another character whose anger comes from a real place) Enjoyed Jordan in Creed and liked the character. Which made it hard to accept him as a bad guy. However he quickly made me change my mind as the menacing Killmonger. 
In short see the movie for what it is, another Marvel hit, this time with a different spin that will bring a new base of fans to the Marvel dynasty."
BLACK PANTHER,18 September 2018,4/10,It's not worth watching this crap at all worst marvel release of all time I don't understand how the movie won 20 awards!
BLACK PANTHER,25 July 2018,1/10,"Overhyped, bad script, terrible accents and CGI. And this crap cost $ 200 000 000?! Worst thing is that there will be a sequel, only because a lot of black people saw it because all the actors are black! This is the beginning of the end for Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"A very entertaining movie, with wonderful acting across the board, with a few stand-outs: Okoye and Shuri both had a charm that was very appealing as well as M'Baku- he was entertaining as well. Okoye and Shuri deserve their own movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"It is not often that I take the time to write a review, but I believe for this movie it is in order. First, Black Panther as a character in the MCU has to be established in his position socially, politically, and globally - done, done and done. Second, the acknowledgement of T'Challa as a world force to be reckoned with is established in the context of his rule as King. For those who don't know, Black Panther/T'Challa is the only superhero who also is a head of state - this point is established solidly in his prior showing in Captain America: Civil War. Lastly, there is the ever looming conflict of how does a country engage the rest of the world when that world has shown hostility towards its potential advancement?
Those questions are established and debated strongly in this movie. While regarding the potentiality of development one African society could experience if never encroached upon by the outside world. Once again, the form and structure of the challenges for T'Challa and what he faces in overcoming these issues and shortcomings is established. Black Panther has to set the context of his story within his own domain, faced with having to overcome the habits of the past with the needs of the future. Black Panther sets up his further development into the MCU and the stories to come. What I respect about this film is despite it being fictional, it gives dignity to the issues Africa has faced from the 15th century unto present day. It approaches the issues of African vs African Americans and people who are considered the Third World, and the true misnomer it must be in regard to a society left to grow untouched by the outside world.
It tackles the homecoming aspect of African peoples reaching out to its descendants and antecedents. Black Panther covers an extraordinary amount of ground, establishing traditions, rites of ascension, acknowledgement of duty above personal interest or belief, understanding of community interest over individual interest. Ryan Coogler does an excellent job in the co-writing on this movie to set the tone for a character whose challenges are not only individual but global, socio-political, and scientific. I give this movie a 10/10 because if you understand the history, and how it is referenced and addressed, the MCU and Marvel Studios does not fail to pay respects not only to a challenging character to portray, but to ensure it pays respect to the cultural heritage which it is connected to. Black Panther is a broader character whose powers are not simply attached to his individual perspective on right and wrong, or good over evil, but the management of those powers in the protection of an entire nation and its diverse peoples (use, diverse - 5 tribes who warred, but established peace and established Wakanda). All in all, the powerful, and human figures. The dry and focused humor which are natural in such situations. Furthermore, the well defined personal values of beauty and power (especially amongst the Dora Milaje), and men who say what they mean, and mean what they say having the restraint to know how to excercise such power.
Go see Black Panther - judge for yourself, and before you decide it's not your typical MCU movie - That's the point, he's not your typical Marvel character. Enjoy!"
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,10/10,"Beautifully shot with amazing costuming and extremely well planned world building. String script, strong actors, well executed vision. I hope to see many Oscar nods for this film."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"OK, I know. Everyone hates this movie, but I don't get why? It has everything you need, amazing visuals, and not so bad of a story. Well, it's Marvel, not European Art Cinema. I gotta be honest, the story was still better than any of the Thor's movies. Thor Ragnarok was a flop, it wasnt an action movie, it was a comedy. Black Panther delivers what it's promising for sure. Entertainment: Is it funny? Yeah! Does it have a decent plot? Yeah! Stunning Visuals? OH YEAH!I don't get what the problem is, you have to look at it from the perspective of MCU, This is a movie that is trying to achieve entertainment, it's not trying to make you cry because how good the story is."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,5/10,"At first I didn't want to watch it, but finally I did since everyone seemed to like it (and I don't know why the rating's so high).. In the end, I'm disappointed. I don't say it has no good, but it's far below my expectation. My friends (5 of them) are with me, they prefer Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. I hope Infinity War will be much much better than this, actually it should be.About this film (just some general explanations why I don't like this movie):
Technologies are amazing at the first time, but not used very well, I mean... You could do this and that using ""it""... Why you just fight like that? so stupid.The ending is quite a disappointment as well (hope this isn't included as spoiler).. you will understand why.Overall I dislike this movie that I much prefer Thor Ragnarok. Fighting scene, comedies, and the thrill was real. Black Panther? I don't think he's that special, maybe not yet.. It's like having two Iron Man (which is not even any better than him), you know, in a non-american version (no offense)... I already have Iron Man, so why bother for Black Panther? That's what I thought after watching this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,1/10,"Terrible!
CGI was bad aswell as the acting.
Dialogue was also terrible.
Not sure why this movie is rated so high."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,1/10,Felt like I was watching Avatar with an African spin on it.
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2019,1/10,"While I was watching the movie, I felt somewhat disappointed and uncomfortable. I honestly believe that Black Panther lack respect to the real African people and their culture. And Africa itself is nothing more than a symbol to fulfill the western audiences' curiosity. The settings in the movie are contradictory, and they do not make sense. I cannot imagine with Wakanda as a country with such advanced technology; people still need to win the throne through a savage fistfight. And technically, T'Challa did lose his throne in the combat, and then he revived by eating secret herbs. I think he violates the rules of his own country. But in the movie, he was still depicted as the right one to rule just because he's the decent man and his brother was depicted as a nasty guy.
Besides, there are other logical errors in the film. According to the settings in the movie, T'Challa's sister should be the real ruler of the kingdom since technology is the most potent productive tool there. When his sister controls all the technology, she could easily manipulate the whole Wakanda. The movie is also full of stereotyped images of African people including strange clothes, combat strategies, weird rituals. I'm not saying they are all fake African elements. I'm assuming that these elements are disjointed with modern society and are insipid. Overall, I think if Black Panther should be considered as the victory of the Black people, it's only the victory of the Hollywood Black people. However, the visual effects in the film are pretty cool, but they are still repetitive products of the film industry."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,This movie is the best movie I have seen in years. An all POC cast in a positive afrofuturistic film its what we have been asking for.
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2019,5/10,"THe movies positive feedbacks made me vert hyped to go and see it. on my way home i was very disappointed. however as a true marvel fan i bought movie to ad to my collection. Decided to give it a go again and same disappointment, I started to research the positive feedback the movie had recived. the further i got in my research i started to see a pattern , much of the hype the movie recived tend to had to do with the fact that an Africanamerican actor had the leadrole and the movie took part in uganda with intentions to help thouse in need like many other country are doing. some parts of the movie I enjoyed, and Chadwick Boseman is a brilliant actor, imo the movie should had focused on blackphanter and cut out the world piece to make Chadwick Boseman some sort of saint to some of audiences. I would rather see a movie with in more dept with the storyline focused on the whole blackphanter and vibrianion and how it all begain,"
BLACK PANTHER,27 June 2018,2/10,2 hours of bad English with one highlight in the entire movie - Psy singing in the background when the scene opens in South Korea. Can't understand all the high ratings it has gotten.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"The conflict of the story was presented well, but the resolution was great. 
As a Chinese Canadian who sat in a theater with mostly non-black audiences, the film reaffirmed our moral and political sensibilities in the most effective way possible. The characters successfully animated diverged narratives and choices that are possible to a people who had suffered a history of terror and oppression, and the greatness of a true king who stood for what is right. A great feast for both eyes and the intellect."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther is definitely a great movie and a must watch for superhero fans as well as marvel fans. I don't understand all the negative reviews, its obvious some are just DC fans hating on the movie and some people are just nitpicking very small things, but of course the movie does have flaws. I am a big Marvel fan and a very big fan of the MCU, when I go to see movies in theaters I normally have high expectations as many people do, with Black Panther I did as well. What makes a movie good is different between every single person though i have very high expectations as long as the movie has a good plot, great fight scenes and characters I will be impressed whether i have high expectations or not. Black Panther had a good plot, it does not bore you and keeps you interested but it isn't unique it can be predictable and a bit cliche but throughout the movie i was very interested and wanted to carry on watching . The whole idea of ""Wakanda"" is great and is different from normal superhero movies.Characters are very great in this movie, Chadwick Boseman's character T'Chala was great through out the whole movie, he showed that he wanted to be king and had great chemistry between other characters. Considering T'Chala was introduced in Civil War he's character was developed but through Black Panther he's character develops slowly. Chadwick Boseman once again was excellent playing the character. The Villain Erik Kill-Monger was really good he was intimidating and he's ambitions were clear, although it was slightly cliche he was fantastic! Michael B Jordan did an amazing job and acting was good throughout. I don't want to make this too long but characters had good chemistry between each others and are very likable.To summarize this movie the plot was good,characters were fantastic because they had a good casting choice as well as brilliant chemistry among each other, fight scenes were bad ass and make you love the character BP even more.the jokes throughout this movie are not overused and not forced its just the good old marvel humor as well as the script was well written. Of course this movie did have it flaws the final fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist was disappointing and heavy CGI was used and it was obvious the characters were full CGI and the fight could have been much better. (also forgot to mention CGI was great in the movie at times it wasn't the best but shouldn't bother you) there was probably a few plot holes and predictable at times but didn't bother me too much.Overall the movie was fantastic and you should watch it, of course there are flaws but to me it did not bother me and i was entertained throughout, as I said before we all look differently to movies I said I have high expectations and the movies flaws did not make the movie bad for me but that's usually for most movies. Go watch this movie, lives up to the hype and you will love the character BP more!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2021,1/10,"Overhyped movie, very bad acting only got a star for a black cast."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,2/10,"This was rather bad. The entire premise was just really bad. I really can't get into it. It's weird, and not like any superhero movie I've seen. It's more proof Hollywood has run out of original ideas and fell victim to the PC police. Not to mention the innuendos weren't very subtle."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,9/10,"For being a superhero movie, this film could possibly be the breakthrough movie of the year. All of the characters, even the villain, you felt like you could understand where they were coming from. The movie takes place a week or so after the events of Civil War, so T'Challa has to deal with being the Black Panther, as well as being king of Wakanda. One of the biggest plot points in the film is whether or not Wakanda should show the world their tech, as they are more advanced than any other country. So, the Black Panther and his ""crew"" go out and try to stop Klau, who is one of the people who stole their tech. Back to Killmonger. To many people, including myself, this villain could be second or better than the best villain in the MCU, Loki. The reason for this again is of how his father had betrayed Wakanda, and T'Challa's father killed and completely forgot about Erik. This is the spark that adds to his fire, and the main reason he wants to take over Wakanda, which he does, for a little bit. Now, after that bit. The fight scenes in this movie were done very well, especially the car racing scene. But, the last scene was not done as well as I would have hoped. Some of the CGI was off, and was a little weird. 
With that being my only complaint about the movie, Black Panther is one of the best films in the MCU, and I'm really looking forward to what Marvel does with him in Infinity War."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"This has been touted as a fantastic film by numerous critics, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing. Despite these issues, I thought the positives outweighed the flaws and that the movie was an entertaining experience. I'd give it a strong 6/10."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,7/10,"Pros: The character of Tchalla is one of the best that I have had the pleasure of watching in the MCU. Along with the supporting cast, the actors performances throughout the whole film are very good and a lot of credit should go to the way in which they portray the hero's and villains in the movie, especially by the females in the film.
As much as I feel the second half of the film lacks a large amount content, the first half is superb. Brilliant set pieces, funny dialogue, even though one particular joke feels as though it is straight out of 2015, and a large amount of intrigue. 
I mention the action scenes, they are superb a lot of action and a lot of emotion behind them
Some of the music is fantastic to listen to, some of traditional African music played throughout the whole film fits really well with the premise and setting of the movie. Cons: The green screen creates some of the WORST backdrops I have ever seen in the film. Completely taking you out of what should be some very intense scenes.
I never feel as though there is a lot riding on the story. It is very simplistic and it appeared to me as though if Tchalla was not to overcome the conflict in the film, very little would happen. The world created would not be in a worse place than before, and that is a problem.
As much as I liked the traditional music, the forced trap beats and songs that are jammed into it feel as though it is simply their to relateable to it's teenage audience. Although in some cases it works, they are few and far between, with it often not fitting well within what is being portrayed on screen. More of the traditional music would have been a welcome change and some more suspenseful scores for the car chase scene would have worked a lot better. However, I would say go and listen to the album, that is very enjoyable.Conclusion: I came out of the theatre dissapointed with the movie. And even though I believe it is over-rated I now, after looking back on it, feel as though it is a very good film that is well worth watching. Despite the issues that people appear to be looking over it is a very enjoyable film. Don't go in with the high expectations that people are putting out online as there are some problems with the film. All in all a very good, but flawed movie. 7/10"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,Just simply an over rated movie!!! The makes a lot of assumptions for the audience and shoots for a bit too much.
BLACK PANTHER,9 January 2020,1/10,"This is all based on the premise that a fictional African nation that has closed itself off to outside (European) influences becomes a technologically super power.
This is badly trying to rip off the James Bond franchise with its gadgets & the other superhero movies without the humour and it just goes to show that it doesn't matter how money you have to spend on special effects, you still are unable to make a watchable movie.
I only decided to watch it because of the star rating on this app and have never felt the need to review any movie before this. This is such utter PC girl power/black nonsense, I'm surprised it hasn't ticked the trans box too but then I haven't even managed to watch the entire film before feeling the need to write this review, so there is another hour left to go. This is a pathetic waste of time that I did this to help others as a public service.
Don't waste your time"
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,1/10,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact. I walked out of the cinema at least 30 minutes before the end because it was so boring I felt I was on the verge of a movie induced coma.
The acting was wooden and the script was dreadful. Any attempts at adding humour was embarrasingly bad too.
The movies only saving grace was the baxkground visuals but they didn't compensate for the fact that the movie felt like a gang wars scenario set in Africa with hi-tech weapons and animal based super powers.
The most laughable bit was the fact that they used their tribal blankets as shields against the weapons - yes seriously!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"It's souch a great movie, full of good effects .
The best SF/Fantasy movie!!
""What are those?!"""
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2020,2/10,"I had high hopes from imdb rating, and immediately had a high bar in expectation before watching.
The movie have really weak storyline, it is pretty racial with only two white characters: one is villain, and the other one is clearly stupid although it's CIA and pilot.
The villain had cool arm-gun and it should have used it way better to make more suspenseful action scenes.
Definitely is movie for specific audience.
CGI in movie is good, the scenery is nice, the superpowers of main character is disappointing (scratching like a cat and using force field in unwisely chosen times), acting is meh and couldn't wait to finish watching because it was so boring.
Definitely the worst Stan Lee movie."
BLACK PANTHER,3 December 2018,,Scoring a movie solely for political reasons is not a good idea.
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,1/10,Way too much hype - some special effects but storyline bounced around way too much
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,5/10,I should have read more of these reviews before - it is really disappointing if you expect a good movie based on what you have heard and read.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,6/10,"Alright, all we heard coming in to this movie was it was the best marvel movie ever made and we'll be treated to an incredible story to lead us into the holy grail which is Infinity War! Well.....we got NONE of that. first off, i should note i am a white male. that being said, i didn't find the movie as funny as majority of the theater did but i realize most of the jokes were not directed towards my demographic and i can live it and appreciate that. the visuals were stunning for the most parts (sometimes overdone as most movies like this tend to do). all the actors were great, although every time Michael B Jordan opened his mouth, i wanted to cringe. music and score is very very good. But lets call this movie what it is, a HUGE money grab and filler movie for Marvel before IW. The movie provides almost NOTHING in terms of story line in the MCU and we never see the soul stone?? tf is with that bs. final battle is not good, boring and predictable. and don't get me started about the post credit scenes. total BS who tf cares about Bucky Barnes. beyond let down with this movie. I think its great that Marvel made a role that empowers African Americans and gives them a super hero to look up to, but as a massive fan of the MCU its impossible to not be left with nothing but a sour taste in your mouth."
BLACK PANTHER,5 December 2018,10/10,"Don't get why people are complaining about how unrealistic this movie is or that it was supposed to be the best movie ever, since this movie was supposed to be unrealistic and not even the creators were bragging about it being the best movie ever. Sure, some people like to hype it up and for good reason too. This film did a really good job at making a sympathizable villain who is kinda like Simba from Lion King but turned evil. The world building of Wakanda too was also amazing as it used a lot of African symbolism put together with advanced technology in a way that's difficult to find elsewhere. Overall, this movie was really entertaining and I give it a full 10 to balance out the many negative reviews here."
BLACK PANTHER,5 June 2018,5/10,"I expect way more when I went to see this film. The story wasn't the best, it's sometimes very boring, you can guess everything it's going to happen. I give a five because the spacial effects where amazing"
BLACK PANTHER,6 October 2018,2/10,"My 12 year old son was PUMPED to watch this at home, but ended up riding his rip-stick 40 min into the movie ü§£ YAWN! OVER RATED movie of all time. Absolutely ZERO character development. I wasn't emotionally invested in on single character in this movie. Dare I claim exploitation?"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,"Most action scenes were lit poorly and shots cut so fast that it gave me a headache. Throughout the entire movie the only scenes where there is tension are the moments when T'Challa is fighting without the suit. The end fighting scene looked like a PS2 game. Some scenes had an awkwardly bad green screen, unfortunately. A character in the end gets their throat slit and there was no blood?? No one wants to say it this way, but essentially what Killmonger wants is to kill an entire race. T'Challa's character is painted as a character whose decisions are all correct and morally justified. Most jokes in this movie are pretty bad, but Shuri's are the worst. Also, Ramonda disappeared and never came back?? I would watch this movie again if it was playing on T.V. and I was too lazy to change the channel."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,"I just came from the cinema after hearing rave reviews about Black Panther over the weekend. I was looking forward to seeing it before it became the #1 topic everywhere after seeing the character of T'Challa introduced in Civil War, but I guess I kind of allowed the reviews to influence me going into it because I was expecting something truly unique and special. And as the movie went on, I was having fun but I was waiting for those outstanding, memorable moments to arrive. They sadly never did.Nevertheless, Black Panther made me feel the same way I felt after watching many of the MCU movies that I liked- it was a fun ride, but one I'm probably not going to go on again. What I liked most was the overall look and feel of the movie. Wakanda was stunning, offering a blend of sci-fi tech with more traditional African look that's rarely seen in superhero films and for me it worked. I really loved all the ritualistic elements of this fictional society, their tradition, individual styles, hierarchy and so on. Almost every moment on Wakanda was a good time. I also liked the performances from this cast, Chadwick Boseman and MBJ stood out and delivered it most of the time, whether in dramatic or more comedic moments. Action was also good, however I feel there wasn't enough of it. Black Panther action moments from Civil War were more memorable to me than the one's from his own movie.On a bit of a negative side, the pacing didn't always work for me making the movie feel a bit long. I wish more time was dedicated to Killmonger and his clash with T'Challa, both physically and ideologically. The middle part in Korea was fun but felt a bit pointless in the end. The end fight between two panthers was a bit of a letdown, set in a tight, dark environment. Also, it looked very much like a video game by the end, kind of like Justice League, with both characters looking like they were digitally made for the entire fight. The political and social themes in the movie were not very subtle, as expected. In the end, I got from BP what I really should have expected, which is not a bad thing. Great look and feel, good, effective soundtrack, solid characters and mostly fun action made this an entertaining 2 hours in the cinema."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,10/10,"This movie came through as it promised. Not sure how people can be so negative while the movie was well done and the acting was spot on. So many people are saying it is inferior simply because the cast is mostly black is beyond unreasonable. One called it ""reverse racist"" and criticized it for being ""too black"". What??? It is a great movie about a Black character and it delivered an entertaining escape from the negativity of the world. Marvel delivered a young heroine who is a brainy nerd. It delivered another two strong women who were right up there fighting injustice with the men. It showed the people of Wakanda to be intelligent, compassionate and desiring peace. This movie was positive and delivered role models that kids growing up in a changing world can look up to. For adults like me, it was good clean entertainment. This kind of movie is what we need more of!"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,,"This is one of the movies you sit through and really get stuck to the movie and never get bored because it's so entertaining and you don't even feel the time flies by.This is the most recent highest budget movie marvel has produced since Civil War.It cost 200 million dollars to make this movie means there's gonna be lots of scenes with heavily packed action plus great special effects.The acting and the story is great enough to make you forget about you're in the movies and not to care about any critical stiff you've heard about this movie.
This really has a different vibe than any marvel movie you've ever watched.This more is more sophisticated with a superhero with a net worth of 500 Billion dollars and he's got great costumes that'll make you get goose bumps.
This is highly recommended and you should really watch this movie even if you don't feel like watching it because you're gonna have to catch up on everything before the Infinity War hit the movies."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,6/10,"This is your typical Marvel film, which is not a bad thing in itself. It has top level special effects, great action sequences, gorgeous settings and costumes. What it doesn't have is a very good storyline - it's totaly predictable and rather weak. This film also suffers - as usual in Marvel films - from the villain deficiency sindrome: the villian is simply too weak and totaly uninteresting.
As for the actors, they're all good and obiously capable of much more, but they all did what was asked of them flawlessly. But none of them will win any awards for this film, and that's the truth. Chadwick Boseman makes a competent hero, though not a very memorable one. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o stand out as two very strong and gorgeous women (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and an extraordinary actress). Andy Serkis is awsome, as always. Michael B. Jordan stands out for the negative, as possibly one of the worst and dullest villains in movie history.
All in all, your average Marvel film, with all it's strengths and faults. Honestly, with all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting a lot more. Wonder Woman stands untouched as the best superhero film ever made."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2019,6/10,"Black Panther is an important film. There's no denying this - The relevance of it's diverse and inclusive cast in a whirlwind of superhero movies that are some of the most seen and highest grossing films of the past decade (as well as being launchpads for a million different toys, models, figures sold across the world) is something you have to take into consideration when looking at this movie.
Objectively, this is a really entertaining watch! As with most marvel movies of late, much of the fight choreography is exciting and different, and the movie in general is... mostly well acted. Standout performances by Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan have to be mentioned; both actors play their parts with genuine sincerity, and add weight to a fairly lofty story (especially in the wake of 'more relevant to the MCU' films such as Civil War). Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as Black Panther from CW, but seems to float through this film with little direction? Obviously as an origin story of sorts, this makes sense, but CW introduced Black Panther PERFECTLY, so its odd that in his own film he holds so much less gravitas on screen. This, I believe may be down to one of my 2 major issues with this film: the script.
When I first watched this film, I found the pacing a bit clunky, and thought maybe the editing is abit choppy? Perhaps the actors are struggling to keep up with the narrative? But on rewatch, it occurred to me the script is confused. It simply cannot hold drama and comedy on its shoulders the way films like Infinity War did. Shuri is perhaps the most tired use of the Marvel comedy formula seen in one of these films yet - 'What are those!' was already an outdated meme by the time the film released, and is PAINFUL to hear. On the other hand, Killmonger's dying monologue by the sunset over Wakanda about his ancestors dying at sea on slave ships, is one of the most poignant moments in the entire MCU. How did they tonally screw this film so hard? Why was Martin Freeman in this film as unneeded, and unfunny comic relief? The script tries so hard in some places, but feels like a total afterthought in others. This, funnily enough paralelles my other main gripe with this film: The CGI.
Oh dear. When the universally unloved Spiderman 3 from 2007 has a far better looking subway fight scene than a larger franchised multi-million dollar blockbuster from nearly a decade its former, you know you've done something wrong. The film opens with quite a stunning credits sequence, stylised and detailed it gives you the sparknotes version of Wakanda and the Black Panther's history. Then Black Panther and Killmonger fight near some trains and good grief it looks BAD. 2 rubber men flung about on a green screen in a dimly lit cavern with nothing going on in the background. The choreography struggles here too, and considering this was the same year as Dr Strange? It's completely pitiful. Some of the absolute worst CGI Marvel has offered paying audiences in this decade (looking at you too, Homecoming).
Overall Black Panther does have a lot of merit. Like I mentioned, the importance of such a diverse blockbuster phenomenon is so great for representation in 2016. For others, the script will have been entertaining, and not everyone will notice the dreadful inconsistencies with the CGI. I can understand the high praise this movie got (Okay, maybe not 3 oscar noms worth, seriously?) But for me personally, these issues stuck out like a very sore, cat scratched thumb, meaning I cant give it more than a 6 and a half out of 10.
Oh, and Andy Serkis is here, doing his crazed Andy Serkis routine. Yeah."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2019,10/10,This movie was so dope from script to the cast and how well the many nations within Africa was portrayed. Not your typical comic/sci fi movie where African Americans are not well represented. This movie shown young black children that there are heroes that look like them. Aside from all the hate and political motivated reviews this movie made money for a reason. This was something the world had missing. Oscar worthy and a movie that will influence the black youth. Definitely worth the money spent.
BLACK PANTHER,31 May 2018,2/10,"I can only think that the high ratings are simply because of the fact that this is a movie about empowering black people and nobody dares give an unpopular opinion about it lest they'd be called racists. But in all truth, this is an awful movie. Dialog is more often than not cringeworthy, and CGI is subpar. I won't even touch upon the plot which is not only an insult to the viewers but to the black people in general as well."
BLACK PANTHER,9 October 2018,1/10,Sucks pretty bad. That's about all I have to say about that. Spoiler. Still sucks.
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,7/10,"I have to say that superhero movies have started to feel more simplistic in my taste. Thor 3 was no exception and neither is Black Panther.The story doesn't add anything new to the MCU, it just floats in it's stream of movies. The revenge plot, the clich√©s, killing one of the better villains in recent Marvel movies, Andy Serkis wasted and much more.But it doesn't mean it ain't good. Chadwick and Michael give us really good performances here, the themes underlying in the plot, and the CGI looked good (most of the time).In my opinion, you don't need to watch this movies to watch Infinity War. The trailer shows his presence, which dulls his death and surviving lethal wounds in this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 October 2018,4/10,"So... If this is going to be in the new Oscars, wow then I thoght Oscars have no need more reputation anymore.Yaiks!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,3/10,"After reading all the great feedback this movie got, I was shocked to see what a piece of nothing it was. Felt like they took a huge bucket and put everything in it: bad jokes (plenty), bad acting, boring scenes, sf, powerful weapons, voodoo, good FX, bad FX, drama, good acting ( Andy Serkis ), oh and all the dancing and the colors... It had 2 or 3 good ( great ) scenes, I want to highlight the car chase and the prison part. It could have gone nicely from there, but no, you had to blew it. They are talking about the most advanced technology and weapons, but they are fighting with spears and a blanket...oh and Jordan is trash, with the attitude, didn't fit the movie at all. I was expecting Timon and Pumba to show up, and smoke something with Jordan's kid while they sing ""HAKUNAMTATAH"". I know 3/10 is harsh but so is my patience with bad movies."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,1/10,"Had a hard time staying awake during this movie. Actually fell asleep twice, and my son had to wake me. I wouldn't waste my time or money to see this film."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,7/10,"I was quite hesitant going into Black Panther. It quickly brought on a nice change of pace compared to other MCU films. While there was a slight dragging feel between the action sequences and humor I felt was a bit forced, Ryan Coogler and team kept everything in line and put together a good movie. Overall, while not an objectively top tier Marvel Movie. But definitely one of my personal favorites."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,2/10,I suspect that the most positive ratings come from black people who are happy to get a black superhero from Marvel. The movie is totally crap! Not even a B-movie compared to 'Infinity War'. I know a superhero movie does not necessarily have to be very realistic but a high-tech society created by people who yell 'uga uga' when their primeval prince fights against another primitive one? Please!
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,4/10,"Good movie overall. Definitely less than expected. The beginning of the movie is really boring and the end as well. However, some really good parts in it still. 
From a personal point of view, this movie definitely doesn't deserve all the rewards but it's worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,2/10,"Wow! That was awful! I've never checked my watch so many times in a movie. The plot is so predictable, nothing is a surprise. The story is sprinkled with scenes that make no sense and are not even important but have somehow made it into the final cut. Please listen to me and do not watch this movie unless you need to get to sleep fast!"
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,10/10,"From start to finish, everything in this film blew me away. the direction, screenplay, performances, costume design and the visual. The MARVEL movie so far."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,1/10,"Superhero movies are supposed to be a magical place where race and political ideologies are put aside. They are supposed to let us escape into a wonderful place where for a few brief hours there's no worry. This movie is the worst Marvel movie to date. Rampant racism, even going so far as using the term ""white boy"", and blatant political ideologies that are so obvious you can't enjoy the film. If any white characters used the term ""black boy"" all hell would break loose. The only good things are the stunning visual effects and Michael B Jordan's performance. As a bad guy he was absolutely amazing and plays the part like you'd want a antihero to be. Summary is this.....if you are a fan of racist and politicized superhero movies then you've hit paydirt. If you want an escape then stay away, especially if you're a white male."
BLACK PANTHER,14 June 2018,10/10,"I love wakanda and there cultur, I loved black panther and the wakandas accent, i loved killmonger, he is just so badass, i loved black panthers suit and the upgrade he getsIt is just an amazing movie"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,7/10,"Let me start off and say that this film is aesthetically pleasing. The visuals of 
Wakanda are amazing, along with the the costume designs and cinematography. For the most part, the CGI was decent, but in some parts it looked very fake. At times you could tell that the characters were in front of a green screen. 
Now onto the acting, I have to say that all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job. Chadwick Boseman nailed it as the king of Wakanda, along with his friends. All the characters were diverse and unique. Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, was probably my favorite character in the movie, as she ailed it as a smart teenager. 
The villains of the movie, Kilmonger and Ulysses Klaue, were fantastic as well. I felt that they shouldn't have killed off Klaue, as his performance was amazing and it would've been cool to see him in other MCU films. Kilmonger was good too, but I felt that he was trying to act ""too tough"" at times, when he was already intimidating.
Now let me say that they did an excellent job on depicting the Wakandan culture. This seperates this movie from many other MCU films and makes it unique. 
Now I must talk about the ""BAD THINGS"".
The pacing was off. It started out action packed and then it was slow, then it was action packed again-The CGI and green screen were very noticeable at times and in some scenes the CGI looks unfinished, like in the last fight between Kilmonger and T'challa. They looked like clay in that sceneSHOULD YOU WATCH IT?
Overall, Black Panther was a decent MCU film. It could've been better with a few tweaks and changes, but it was still fun to watch. You should go watch it. as it is very entertaining. If I were to rank this in a list of TOP 10 Marvel movies, I would put this one as the 7th. NOW GO BUY YOUR TICKETS!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,,"Not a Marvel person, and although The Black Panther himself was cool. The women in this movie were dope. You haven't seen a better group of strong ass Kickibg women in a movie. Must see!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"So so disappointed. Black Panther is one of my favorite comic book characters, and I have been looking forward to this from the moment he appeared in civil war. But I was actually bored for the first time in a marvel film, his story and part in civil war was so much better than his own film.This was superhero movie by the numbers....... our man suffers a tragedy to make him suit up, baddie turns up and beats him up a bit, then he returns from the 'dead' to win the day...... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzOh and dont bother hanging on for the after trailer clips......Lets hope infinity war makes up for this....."
BLACK PANTHER,2 April 2018,2/10,"As a fan of the character and everything Marvel, I was looking forward to this and even pre-ordered the Blu-ray before going to the cinema.
Having been to the cinema I have now cancelled the Blu-Ray, this is not a movie I would want to watch again.
Andy Serkis played a good villain which makes for a promising start, but after he meets an untimely end there is nothing else to redeem it.
The story is shallow, the final battle sequence is so predictable.
If the films box office figures are to be believed, it can only be because fans of the genre don't want to miss anything that will lead into Infinity War - they don't need to worry, this is purely a stand alone movie.
Black Panther is such a good character, it's a shame they couldn't have developed him with a decent storyline after his successful introduction in Civil War.
The worst Marvel movie since Incredible Hulk."
BLACK PANTHER,3 October 2018,1/10,"Black Panther looks like a stupid attempt from Marvel Studios to hide bad direction and plot holes behind the wall of the racism topic. Most of the critics are afraid to criticise this stupid movie because they are afraid that they will be called racist, if they will speak truth about this movie. But the reality is that this is the worst superhero movie ever."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"MARVEL once again knocked it out the park with their newest addition to the MCU franchise. It was interesting and exciting from the first minute to the last. Perfect balanceof action and drama, as well as some light comedy at all the right moments, with some truly astonishing visuals. An absolute masterclass."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"I'm not here to give a 10 stars review so that the general grade can increase, because that would not be really helpful looking at the real quality of the movie. I did however rate is with 1, so that the grate can reach a rating that is closer to the one this movie deserves. Not based on the fact that people tend to rate this movie based on the politics and ethnic racial war (which should never, ever interfere with any movie in general), but for what the movie really offers to it's fans. There are better movies out there that are rated way worse than this one. If you objectively look at this movie, you can see that is not worth more than a 6.5. Maybe if you are a MARVEL fan a 7. That's because the movie was lacking in action. The movie wasn't too much about the Black Panther but the tech that he had. The character didn't had the space to built itself which is such a shame considering the fact that that was what the movie was all about!! It would have been awesome to see more action from the panther, to have scenes where you can see all those amazing skills that he posses..the movie had the space to make this hero look way cooler that it did. Shame..."
BLACK PANTHER,3 January 2019,8/10,Usually not a big fan of marvel movies but really enjoyed this one.
BLACK PANTHER,23 April 2018,9/10,"Loved this movie for the cast, message, and the revolution!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 October 2018,1/10,"What could have been a great film, isn't! What a wasted opportunity. Nothing new, nothing original, nothing interesting, much used plot, common character groups, etc. Though the movie you think it's just giving some necessary background and then it is going to get better, but it doesn't."
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,4/10,"Too much CGI, makes effects looks far too fake, plot average at best, only reason to see film is because it featured in Avengers. Watched for free and 14 year daughter fell asleep watching it. Better films out there."
BLACK PANTHER,20 November 2019,10/10,I am not a serial reviewer. In fact this is my first ever IMDB review.I saw this movie in the cinema on its first week of release in 2018.Was completely blown away then and still love it BIG TIME. An amazing and incredible story indeed.Can't wait for Black Panther II in 2022.Watch it if you haven't and if you loved movies like Avatar and Tron!!!
BLACK PANTHER,26 April 2018,1/10,"Super hero movies generally are all about effects, they have poor stories and even worse acting, this one really was the worst yet, awful story, awful acting and a complete mess. I don't know what websites are promoting these films as 8 or 9 out of 10 but they are definitely are ones with something to gain.A really bad movie, If I could vote no stars I would"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"Sit through the first half hour and you are duly rewarded. There's a lot about the MCU from a scriptwriting standpoint I couldn't stand, but this and Ragnarok prove that we are thankfully far away from the days of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1. Black Panther is so much more thematically dense, rich and driving that many others in the franchise, and unlike Ragnarok, the emotional conflict drives the core physical conflict that is the cause of all the explosive action scenes. The film does not shy away from the obvious political bent; the dying lines of the villain lean so hard into the theme of oppression vs. the potential/imperative to improve upon it that I almost can't believe the soulless heads driving the Marvel project let them get away with it.But you have to make it to the Forest Whitaker exposition scene around the midpoint. Until then, Black Panther doesn't feel like it has much of a story. The first act is all set-up with one action scene and not a particularly great one at that, and with only three more big setpieces to follow it doesn't actually get to show off the Black Panther toolkit much at all, even with all the Chekhov's Guns going off in just the right places. So while I think this is one of the best Marvel movies from an artistic standpoint, there are others, like both Guardians and Ragnarok, that are better paced, better delivered movies."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Best in line movies from mcu expecting more of his reprisal role in infinity wars
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,10/10,"I didn't expect much from this movie, as I thought of each super hero movie to be really similar to the other, but watching Black Panther left me truly breathless! Amazing actors, stunning visuals and an amazing story, I absolutely love it."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I feel sorry for those who have watched this film and gave it poor ratings because the actors don't act like your average marvel ""American actors"". I've grown up around Nigerians and Kenyans and I can tell you for sure the acting was spot on. They captured their culture and mannerisms in a respectable manner. 
I've seen most of the marvel movies and was growing bored until this movie. It actually has a message in it that's not to be missed. I've never experienced that within marvel movies. It usually features the same plot and the same cheesy ""good overcomes evil"" message. But the message portrayed in this movie is one that highlights current issues and should truly be taken to heart.
On another note, I feel so proud of the lighting, makeup and wardrobe used to highlight the beauty of black people. I often feel the lighting on black people within movies and TV still in this day and age makes them look washed out and grey. This movie truly makes their colour shine like pure gold! It was beautiful just to watch this even without the plot. 
My hope is that the character of Black Panther can bring depth into the Avengers movies and take the plot to a whole new level."
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,5/10,"While the expectations where high, for a hype entouraged movie, it did not quite live up to those expectations.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. The effects, costumes and props were decent.It was the story and the lame acting that bothered me throughout the whole movie.In comparison to other Marvel cinematics; Black Panther was not that good. It was an 'ok' movie. Something that would be 'ok' on a dull mondaynight (on tv). It's a movie I wouldn't pause while going to the bathroom... and that's not a good thing."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,It's the best thing Marvel has done. It's absolutely fantastic!
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"I have to say, after all the hoopla (which I was growing tired of), Black Panther ranks for me as one of the best action movies of all time, 2nd only to Return of the Jedi (don't judge me), and even one of the best dramas. Was surprised by so much of this sort of ""anti-hype"" criticism. I believe some used to the typical super hero flick of Today, simply want pulse-pounding action every minute, with a few wise-cracks thrown in, and maybe half-decent lines delivered. This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that. Tell them it really is just that good beyond the racial make-up, then tell them a White hero actually figures prominently in the end, so don't fret... ;-)"
BLACK PANTHER,10 December 2018,1/10,"The predictable story line and dialog was incredibly thin, was so disappointing. I could only watch 45 minutes, so perhaps it got much more involved with the characters and the viewing audience. I was shocked with the critiques that this is a great movie."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,7/10,"This movie is great actually but it has flaws and definitely isn't the best movie in the MCU. So Pros and cons.
Pros
The acting was superb, every actor in the cast did a fantastic job eBay Michael B Jordan steals the show. I used to think he was just ok but he was excellent in this.-The fight scenes were great. On Par with Civil War but not as good as TWS.
Killmonger was a good villian, if they had have made his goal less 'take over the world' he would've been amazing but I understand iphis motivation. We see that he feels betrayed that he could have been raised by royalty but instead lived in poverty eventually becoming orphaned.The comedic timing was good, it didn't feel out of place like a lot of other Marvel movies.Cons
The third act was so underwhelming and unsatisfying it hurt. Everything is rapped up too neatly and the final fight didn't reflect anything learnt throughout the movie, just that T'Challa is more perceptive? Strategic? Idk.T'Challa had no arc. He started at one political view at the start of the movie and just changed it. I didn't have much investment in T'Challa.No one cared about Zuri. We should have.CGI looked like stretch Armstrong at some points."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Amazing movie overall! Some sad parts, happy parts, funny parts, parts that will make you wanna smack someone, and more. No boring or slow parts! Will make you wanna watch the 3D version, IMAX, and standard. Big plot twist! Funny characters and great CG! Will watch again and again!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,7/10,"Black Panther is a good movie, but not a great movie. The central portion of the film is really good and the characters are all engaging while the villain delivers motivations above and beyond the usual Hollywood standard.The problems I found with Black Panther really only came at the beginning and end of the story. For me it took quite a while for the story to actually get going (not till Michael Jordan's character shows up in Korea does the the story really start to pick up pace) though as they were establishing both the characters and setting this is perhaps understandable and I would expect this not to be such an issue in subsequent films. The ending I found a little rushed by contrast and wish they had spent slightly less time on the set up and more time on the pay off.The other major problem I found were with the fight scenes, which I found slightly repetitive; the 'challenge' scenes were quite well done however the confrontation between the hero and villain at the end felt underwhelming, certainly when compared with the rest of the battle taking place elsewhere, that however is not uncommon in Marvel films.Overall well worth seeing and I look forward to more Black Panther films."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,Love the action and the true meaning behind this film.
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,,"Not that great not that bad, one time watch.
Will be fun to see him in Avengers."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Extraordinary outfits and Cast of the Movie took its audience to the new world of T'Challa's Wakanda. Loved the T'Challa & Shuri duo. Vfx and CGI of this movie helps to levitate extraordinary fight scenes throughout the movie.....
One of it's kind from MCU - Black Panther"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Spoliers ahead
First, let me say I did go into this film with very high expectations because of the hype surrounding the film, as well as the nature of what the film represented to a group of people. Most of all, because I'm a avid collector of comics books and black panther happens to be one those series that I collect. In general it is very hard for me to sit through a film adaption of a comic book and look at it from a objective point of view. I always find myself wanting to compare it to the source material, and normally I end up disappointed-not because the film is bad per se, but because it doesn't live up to my expectations. 
There have been very few films that have been point on that I've loved. Deadpool, Kickass, the Watchmen, and even though Logan wasn't the version of old man Logan I would of loved to see on the big screen, I loved that film as well. I could even appreciate some aspects of Christopher Nolan's version of Batman. But we're not here to talk about those films, this is about Black Panther. 
The film follows T'Challa as he steps into his role as king (I'll try hard not to put too many spoilers or story material in here for those who are still going to see it). The events of this film follow after Captain America civil war. T'Challa is back in his country Wakanda, fictional African nation that is described as the most technologically advanced place in the world. This is due to a very valuable and rare metal called vibranium. T'Challa's goal is to ensure that his people are safe and by doing this, he sets to continue to keep Wakanda a secret. T'Challa believes if the world knew how advanced Wakanda was and knew that they were storing the virabium then his people would surely be attacked by outsiders. 
Now, the villain of the film, Killmonger, who I won't go into specific detail about, is the opposite of T'Challa. He is a black militant. Actually, I'll even dare to say that he holds true to the real black panthers' (from the 1960's) way of thinking. Killmonger wants to not only take over Wakanda but he wants to use its advanced resources to do what others have done to his people. Colonize. He believes that the they should use Wakanda's technology to arm their people around to world to overthrow their oppressors and take over every other country. 
The story more or less revolves around this conflict of thinking. And while watching it I couldn't help but to think of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom x. As well as Professor Xavier and Magneto whose ways of thinking we're based on the aforementioned. One wanted to take over the world or overthrow those who oppressed them/hated them. While the other sought to co-exist with those who were different from them-to show them over time that they were the same.
This is the stance the story pretty much takes and in the end, T'Challa agrees with Killmonger to an extent. Instead of taking over the world he wants to extend his resources by educating and building up black communities around the world. There are a lot of political elements thrown into the film that brush upon current issues. Past issues and reoccurring issues. And the director does an excellent job of building this into the film while making it entertaining for anyone to be able to enjoy. 
He also does a great job of showcasing black panther in a positive light. A hero who has his faults and fails at times but finds a way to overcome his doubts and weaknesses. He beautifully melds aspects of African culture into a fictional universe as well as properly represents the background characters as not just warriors, but also elegant and intelligent people. I think all of these things are not only true to the source material, but also important for other African Americans, especially those of a young age,
to see. It gives them something to be proud of. It gives them characters they can not only relate to, but look up to and strive to be like the powerful intelligent people that those actors were portraying. 
There were some minor things about the film that I thought could of been touched up on like the fighting, which I thought was a tad choppy at times especially towards the climax. And the cgi I felt could of been a little better especially towards the end when Black Panther and T'Challa was fighting. I also couldn't help but to think of he lion king at times during the film but again those were minor things to a film that I thought lived up to the hype it created. 
The movie was easy to follow even for someone who has not watched captain America civil war or read any of the Black Panther comic books. The plot was engaging and informing, and the people and culture were beautiful to watch on the big screen. There was a great mixture of action and comedy, as well as drama. In the end, it's a Marvel film, but definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,8/10,"I think it's easy to pick out for yourself the quality negative reviews here as opposed to the more...basely...motivated ones. For me, the film was a great addition to the Marvel film universe. One can only take more of the same scenery, same villains, same ""high stakes"". I think this was fresh and successful in it's goal. I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the laughs, and I enjoyed that the laughs and the film were for a broader audience. The villain was much more compelling than your run of the mill Marvel villains and he delivered a line towards the end that made me cry with empathy. The film wasn't black and white, which is where I think it won me over. There's nothing I despise more than an average, black and white, superhero film. There was a lot of grey and nuance here. While some characters could have had more opportunity to shine (the queen, for example), I think this was ultimately a successful and worth watching film. The scenery was beautiful, costuming was executed fantastically, the score was great, the female characters were fleshed out and I really enjoyed the main ""romance"" where I do not usually. Certainly near the top of the Marvel pile."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"Favourite Movie
An amazing Marvel villian, a beautiful soundtrack, everyone was amazing! esspicially Okoye (Danai Gurira) :)"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,2/10,"I don't know whether the critics for these movies are bought or afraid to be commenting this movie because of its political standpoint. The film DOES NOT living up to the critics point and user's rating. I would give 2/10 and 3/10 at best. The most entertaining part of this movie is Andy Serkis, and I think Andy Serkis is a more potential villian than this Killmonger portrayed by Michael B. Jordan.I expect for Black Panther to be acting as a wise, intellegent, strategist and also a martial art mastery more of like The Batman of Marvel Universe. This film does not show any of it. Overall it is just boring and I think this movie just needed to be there to fill the plothole of coming Avengers movie.Otherwise there are no entertaining scene or part (even the action is boring), I would not recommend you to watch it"
BLACK PANTHER,13 February 2018,10/10,I went into the cinema with high expectations and came out very happy that i decided to watch it. the film starts of a bit slow and then builds up to the action scenes that look brilliant the story is great as is the villain. the actors didn't sound wooden at all the jokes were timed perfectly the characters were all great. i'll be looking forward to see where marvel goes next.
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,MCU are the Best! i have amazing experience watching the Movie!
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,4/10,"Ahhh here we go again, another Marvel film. And I know I'm probably going to annoy a lot of people but, this is my review and if people disagree good for them. Disappointing, great potential and I really, really wanted to like it but... I didn't. One of the most loved characters in the marvel universe butchered. In the comics T'Challa is portrayed as an intelligent and most importantly a serious character; however, if I were to meet him in real life I wouldn't have a clue what he'd be like, unlike almost any other marvel character such as Iron man, Captain America and even Ant Man etc. The protagonists in the film are undeveloped and this is most obvious when you compare them to the villains that are shown to have a political standing and given such a rich personality over everybody else, when the audience can relate and connect to the villains more so than the protagonists the audience can't drive and support for the good guys; like most other superhero films. Don't get me wrong the villains are shown as such but the lack of character from the protagonists leaves a sour taste is one's mouth, especially since black panther is such a great character in the marvel franchise. I loved the concept of the film, Africa is a great place to branch out into a new franchise of superhero's as well as villains; with a rich and interesting culture so rarely used in all superhero's films. I was really engrossed and absorbed with Michael B Jordan's character ""Warmonger"" and his political beliefs, compared to the protagonists his point of view was relatable as he had experienced the outside world and been formed by it just like us he was an outsider who wished to be a part of this futuristic and successful culture. However, the film lacked to drive home why his political stance was wrong, and how T'Challa's new approach will further benefit the world; I mean buying up properties in less developed parts of California is great but it was never really made clear to the audience (I mean me, and people less-smarter than me) what this was for. And you'd think for a film with an age rating of 12A, with such strong political elements would make it coherent what his solution was. Don't even get me started on the CGI, completely ridiculous and over used. Some elements were so unrealistic e.g. war rhinos who are able to target out their 'enemies', who are also meant to be their allies. if you've seen it think about it, weird right? One of the biggest things was the character T'Challa, who as I've mentioned is an amazing and really cool character, he is also rated to be sixth 'most intelligent' character in the marvel universe however on the big screen he was no-where near what he was meant to be, it was like he was a completely different character in the films; I don't want to sound like a comic book nerd, I love it when characters change in films but this is a completely new person with almost no similarities other than his name. I feel he didn't grow into a King instead he simply changed his political view which is a shame because why couldn't he do both. Worth a watch, but make your own opinion I mean I'm only a film student. Oh and who the hell cared when Forest Whitaker's character died because I certainly didn't, trying to make it like an important characters death, when actually we'd only seen him twice before."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,7/10,"This is my first public movie review. So I will keep it 100 percent positive i.e. all things good. I want to start with positivity. It was a good movie. Solid 7/10.Chadwick Boseman, playing the protagonist King T'Challa/Black Panther, has nailed the parts of ""a good man"", ""king"" and ""warrior"". The Kingship, channeled through his acting, peaked in the scene where he raises his voice in front of the preceding black panthers (in 2nd limbo/dream/ other world sequence) to make a point, his point, a point to bring change, a point that challenges the orthodox thoughts of the preceding Kings/Black Panthers. That is the sequence when the audience learns that the King has arrived(BAM!!).
Killmonger, the antagonist , has also been acted very well. Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, brought a mean/maniacal/destroyer look to him, which was enhanced by the upper body scars created by the makeup department, each scar stood for a kill. (There may be a technical term for the scars, Please comment if you know). Martin Freeman's character could have been more explored, because to me his look was too similar to BBC Sherlock's Dr. Watson. I was getting confused as to why or what Dr. Watson was doing in Wakanda? (Watson-Wakanda, maybe there is some connection.)There were multiple story arcs that were pondered upon in the film. The rise of a king, the revenge of an outcast (outcasted without his fault), a general's loyalty towards throne or the man sitting on the throne, a son dealing with demons created by his father and many more. On a personal note, I think the arc of Killmonger could have easily been taken to some other direction. His character has got such enriched background and history that so much more could have been done with his character.The visual effects were superb. Scenes such as the entrance to Wakanda, the dreamland/limbo sequence, the Black panther cave, the Vibranium structured city stood out amongst many others.Another uplifting thing about the movie was the comedy. The comedy that erupted between King brother and prodigy-scientist sister and between Dr.watson and Man-ape/M'Baku were the ones that stood out for me. I could narrate some of them in fresh fashion but I do not want to spoil the joke! So just watch it yourself.Costume design in the movie is another area that must be applauded. The Black Panther's costume is like Deadpool's costume. There is nothing fake about it. You don't need to CGI it. You can put a jacked dude in that costume and you've got yourselves a Black panther, looking person. It just feels real. The vibrant costumes worn by all the cast such as Queen mother and different tribes and people of Wakanda had a fresh feel to it. The costume design was as unique as Wakanda is supposed to be.Overall a good movie. Worth a watch in a theatre.SUMMARY- A ""good MAN"" must become flexible in his/her ways if duties of ""a king"" are to be performed aptly."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,9/10,"It's been a long time, I am pretty much satisfied with any comic movie after seeing disasters in Batman V Superman , Civil War. Black Panther amazing character and a new crush for all girls I am damn sure."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,Lives up to its expectations! I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Very well thought out plot.
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"This movie is just amazing. The story line even though cliche is executed perfectly. The soundtrack is just splendid. It is just beautiful and evoked so many emotions within me of completeness and tranquility. The acting is great, especially from Lupita and Chadwick Boseman.
Amazing action and the pace is right for such a movie."
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie totally expecting it to suck. I am a huge Superhero/Comic book fan but to be honest I never read any of the Black Panther comics or know anything about this Super hero. I first saw the panther appear in Captain America Civil war and I thought the hero was meh.. I jumped to the conclusion Black Panther is only getting his on movie because Marvel studios are trying to appear more inclusive and progressive and all that PC stuff lol. I couldn't be more wrong. They actually had a plan for this hero. Great back story, Fantastic visuals, great acting, totally hilarious, moving and poignant in parts, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really wasn't expecting the film to be this good. It felt like a cross between Coming to America and Thor. Go watch this film and I promise you wont be disappointed. All i can say is Wakanda forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther was so... AMAZING! I feel so speechless. It's about time we get a GOOD QUALITY film. Black Panther was hands down the best I've seen from Marvel to date. Please do yourself a favor and watch this film! Thor, who?! Iron Man, who?! Captain America, WHO?! Black Panther makes those other films seem like a circus. They've really outdone themselves with this one.From a critical point of view, the storyline was fantastic and well developed. Marvel departs from their usual one-size-fits-all plot formula, making it difficult to anticipate every next move. Character development was so great that viewers can easily feel emotional attachments to the characters in times of happiness, sadness, pain, and fear. The colors and cinematography were just delicious. Even the costumes were downright amazing. Everything was just so rich! Marvel, THIS is how you need to make movies from now on."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,1/10,"I watched Black Panther coz it's Valentine's Day, an important day in the Philippines. I was hoping that the critics' reviews are accurate. This has 98-100% on Rotten Tomatoes and the media is going bananas for this movie. It's an entertaining movie but extremely overrated.Expect the same formula from MCU. This movie mentions a lot from previous MCU movies that if you haven't watched them all, you'll be very confused like me. I don't understand some things being mentioned because this movie references the previous movies so much. The opening is good but the story drags that it becomes boring. The fight scenes are good but don't expect so much action from this film. The film is so predictable that I was yawning at some moments. And Marvel releases like 3-5 movies a year so the Marvel fatigue is real. The critics are suspicious. They should give this about 40-50% on RT. Don't trust the critics. Watch this if you want but I don't recommend seeing it theaters. I wanna give this 6 stars but to balance the overrated 10 stars, I will only give 1 star. If you're not a diehard MCU fan, skip the theaters."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I think black panther is above your average marvel movie. In a sense it exemplifies the cultural existence and relevance of the African culture that hasn't been seen in marvel's previous movies. It feels good to see people of color actually being successful and motivated by honor. Black Panther not only was a hero,but he also helped out his community while staying true to his heritage. Kill-monger was raised without a father, in a sense he had an American way of living that was very similar to the selfishness and self centered american President that we have today. If you are racist at all, you will not like this movie. Why? because the cultural symbolism of the African culture constantly thrives on the Black race being the Superior being in this movie. From the technology to the clothes and style. Black Panther not only symbolizes just a super hero movie, but a culture that was once driven by black heritage but settlers took that land and until now it was forgotten. This movie will be historic, showing the power and strength of Black women. Although Black Panther was gone, his girlfriend stood by his side and saved him from death. The resemblance of stubbornness and strength in a very loyal Black woman. Black love that is. Black women thrived in this movie, being the body guards and fully trusted souls that Black Panther believed in. That not only created the technology for him, but they protected him. Something that will always be remembered in a time where our President shake's his head at third world countries :D."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,9/10,"After getting to see it this morning It didn't feel too unique from all the other Super Hero movies but at the same time it wasn't bad, I'd day it was entertaining and with its fight scenes and story telling but it did feel lackluster at the same time. Would recommend someone to watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther follows the story of T'Challa - one of a chosen few with special powers - who returns to Wakanda to play a leading role in its transformation.Although it garners him some resentment, this transformation must take place, or Wakanda will not survive. 10/10 from me."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,"Dont listen to the naysayers who are merely bashing this film out of hate for the hype about the mostly black cast. From Chadwick Boseman to Lupita N'yongo , every performance was stellar. story was intriguing, I was really invested in the villains political views as well as the black panther. The story was paced just perfectly not a dull moment. Everyone did an amazing job from the director, Ryan Coogler to the producers and especially the film crew. MY GOD, the cinematography was absolutely stunning. The visuals were amazing I almost which I could live in Wakanda. All in all a great film start to finish and if you don't hate the racial makeup of the cast I promise you will love this movie 100/10."
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,10/10,This is one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen. Witnessing the strength of an ethnic homeland for the Wakandans made me wonder why Africans the world over don't return to their sacred and ancestral homes. Diversity IS our greatest strength! Let's preserve it with an ethnic homeland for every race. Vive Wakanda!
BLACK PANTHER,15 February 2018,6/10,"It's a typical Marvel super hero movie, if you liked the others you'll like this one. I found it to be pretty mediocre, but I've seen much worse. I went to see it because on RottenTomatoes it is rated 98%, do not understand how that can be the case, wondering if they took money to pump the movie? :("
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,Stan Lee/Disney/Marvel/Chad Boseman & ALL of the people who put THIS AMAZING & CULTURALLY RELEVANT MCU movie together are brushing their shoulders off on the way to the BANK!!!! You will never admit that you don't like it for ONE reason and that's fine because what you hate-WE LOVE!! #Wakandaforever #fictionbutrealtoUS
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,,"I was disappointed, this movie is full of stereotypes, bad acting, and a dull script with lame action sequences."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,,I really enjoyed the movie. The cast was amazing the action was exciting and I really appreciated the plot's message. I'm still giddy after seeing it! I would advise people to go and see it!
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"This is a terrible movie. Slow development, poor action, old and boring plot. And what's with the black panther body armour that keeps deactivating the head section to explore the wearer in combat? The movie is not worthy among MCU movies. It is absurd critics are singing praises of this MCU failure. Where are your integrity as critics? Shameless."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Just saw Marvels Black Panther and I thought it was AWESOME! I thought it was a fantastic look at some very much needed character development, in which Marvel movies tend to not do very well. PROS: GREAT Story. The narrative was easy to follow along, and kept you in the thicke of things. I never got lost. It was also very engaging.PROS: THE WORLD BUILDING. You get to see Wakanda and the city. Way better world building than Thor. You actually felt like your there in Wakanda.PROS: The visuals. Oh man, the visuals were breathtaking.PROS: The Direction. Ryan Cooglar put together a super hero film that felt like a indie drama that happens to have a super hero in it.PROS: The acting. Everyone gets to shine. And all the performances were great. Leticia Wright stole every scene. A few scenes will make you cry. There was so much emotion in this film.PROS: The Villain. Michael B Jordan is great in this, and Marvel finally gave us a great villain. You start understanding where he is coming from, and you actually start feeling for him.PROS: Not a comedy. Hated that Thor Ragnarock was basically a comedy. Marvel films always have tons of jokes in it. Not this one. The jokes here come natural, and not forced.PROS: NOT political. I was told this movie was political. It was from a standpoint of people trying to take the throne, but not political, in a us political. It did feel like Game of Thrones in some areas.CONS: CGI. The final fight was too cgi heavy. It didn't ta me me out of the movie, but it was too cartoonie. CONS: Not enough fighting without the suit from T'Challa. And they downplayed his genius.All in all, I give it a 10/10 and in my opinion, BEST standalone film by Marvel."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"One of the best marvel superhero done so far! the soundtrack, the visual effects, the costumes were amazing, not a single boring moment in the entire movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Although both it and Thor: Ragnarok take place in glittering, futuristic kingdoms, Black Panther strikes a rather different note from the galactic romp vibe Ragnarok went for. Don't get me wrong: while it is rife with serious moments and dramatic tension (it would be hard not to, after Civil War!), and grapples with themes of loss and legacy, Black Panther does manage to smoothly deliver some well-timed comedy to lighten up the journey. Our theater adored Shuri, T'challa's irrepressible little sister, and I'm sure you will too.Many will zoom in, so to speak, on the visual richness of the film: African designs and aesthetic isn't something we see very much of in mainstream American media, to say nothing of our blockbusters, and the futuristic skyline of Wakanda has obviously been carefully crafted to make the city both unique and true to its roots. And the scenery is excellent, as is the costuming. However, the movie's strongest point, I feel is in its acting. Every one of the main cast delivered a memorable performance: Chad Bosewick is finally allowed to fully portray T'challa's grief and conflict to spectacular effect; Lupita Nyongo'o matches him scene for scene and is impossible to take your eyes off of; Michael B. Jordan manages to be at once terrifying, sympathetic and too compelling to make a truly tidy villain; Danai Gurira's screen presence and the sheer force of nature that is the character Okoye herself comes through from the very first time she steps onscreen, and sometimes without a single word spoken; and Letitia Wright dances effortlessly from the hilarious to the heartrending, stealing every scene she's in. I would need a lot more words and a lot more time to detail every performance that needed praising.So, while Black Panther is at its core a Marvel superhero movie, with the requisite cheese, heaping helping of action (Note: I'm not complaining, because that shit was fun as HELL), and some heavy-handedness in its political messaging (let's remember, though, Iron Man and Afghanistan and terrorism, terrorism, terrorism)... It's the chemistry and passion that both the actors/actresses and the film crew have put into this movie that form the heart of the story. It has the distinction of being the first Marvel movie that managed to make me well up, all while sitting at the edge of my seat and then being surprised into laughing by a deftly executed bit of slapstick or snark. It doesn't shy away from examining issues of racism, broken families, tradition vs. responsibility, pacifism vs. imperialism, and other uncomfortable topics that the world, but especially the U.S., could stand to reflect upon this year. It works through these issues to show us the characters moving towards a more hopeful future than any previous generation could have imagined, and isn't that what sci-fi is all about?Our theater loved this film. We laughed together, we cried together, we applauded together at the end. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Black Panther. I absolutely plan on seeing it again, and making sure the rest of my family does, too."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Amazing film, this film follows some of the other recent Marvel film e.g. Deadpool and Spiderman homecoming because it was partly very funny which worked fantastically within the story line. 
The cast was amazing and I loved the fact that 99% of the accents were African because it added something different to the Marvel universe. 
The reason why I did not give Black Panther a 10/10 is because I felt like there was not enough fighting scenes within the film, not only were the fighting scenes very short but there were not enough of these.
Overall, the director did an insane job with this film and it will be talked about for many years to come, this film is a MUST WATCH for anyone that has not watched it and likes the Marvel universe."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,2/10,"When I first heard about this amazing film and how it was by people of color for people of color I was very pleased. We have never been in a super hero movie before and it was refreshing to see and as a person of color I felt empowered. Every time T'Challa jumped it was me jumping, everytime he holler it was me that guided his voice, everytime he punched it was me. He was very relatable unlike Tony Stark (yuck) who is rich and white, and the actor who played this black chocolate hero don't even get me started meow am I right girls, that is exactly the kind of eye candy a woman like me needed to get into the theatre. But the one thing I don't get is why would the director make such a handsome and powerful black character the embodiment of Drumph? He represents everything Drumph does. It makes me so mad why would you make such a beautiful movie but make me want to root for Drumph?! 2 stars for that chocolate mmm and the authentic Africana"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,3/10,"I had high hopes for this movie after the stellar reviews started rolling in, but to be perfectly honest, this movie is EXTREMELY boring...One of the only action scenes in the movie is the air flip over the car you see in the trailer. The other is the awkwardly short ""climax"" at the end. Seriously, it's over so fast you won't believe it's really over. It felt like the director just wanted to call it a day and be done with this movie. Ultimately I feel really cheated after how amazing BP was in Civil War. Take a pass on this one, the critics are lying."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I loved it!!! It was like watching 3 movies in one! It was so funny and the fight scenes were so original and epic and the lines were so well written. I honestly have never written a review before about a movie but I felt like i needed to let others know how much I enjoyed it with my husband. 
Love love love!"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,,"Empowering, captivating, executed flawlessly. One must realize that this is a superhero movie. Designed to be enjoyed by 10-year-olds as well as adults. For an origin film, the movie brings you up to speed perfectly Chadwick Bozeman does a phenomenal job playing 'T'Challa'. MCU really has their films down to a science and adds onto the forumula they'vs built on franchises like Thor / Avengees etc. Also I would be very wary of any reviews prior to February 14. It may be fake news.  If you are on the fans definitely check it out will be disappointed"
BLACK PANTHER,10 April 2018,8/10,"I like this movie too much and so it have many point of view and favorites characters is Erik Killmonger, he doesn't be the evil like Loki but he only want to give free and legal to the black peoples that is a reason why I like Killmonger and Ryan Coogler do it so good the story is hard to think and the characters have many side. This is my review."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"I loved Shuri and the portrayal tribal rituals.
Humor hits sometimes. 
Movie gives a clear image of Wakanda.
Killmonger could have said more than just one liners.Some scenes were obvious green-screen and the CG fight was distracting and terrible (Is marvel getting lazy with it? I mean they have huge budgets for these movies and they still couldn't deliver a proper blend of real action and cgi like they did in some of their previous films)It was an alright movie, falls short by the third act. If you watch the trailer you kind of get the gist of the movie
Needs more Shuri.
Forgot to mention, this movie is completely unrelated to infinity war, no teasers even. They kind of baited us into watching this by showing scenes of wakanda in the infinity war trailer"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,This is history being broken! This film has just the right amount of cheese on this perfect burger full of flavor & creativity. I love the story line and the build of this amazing character. Cant wait to see the growth of this Marvel action hero #MustSee 10/10
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Takes you on an historic action packed ride, conflict from without and within, it is all in this movie, absolutely a must see"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,"As far as the story goes, Black Panther was really interesting. Killmonger is definitely one of the better MCU villains. T'Challa was a great character. 
The acting was more or less good.. Andy Serkis was terrible to the point of absurdity. Bilbo just played Bilbo again. And Shuri wasn't really good.The action was to my surprise really poorly shot, especially the last fight.The soundtrack was amazing for the most part. It reminded me a lot of the Lion King opening. Except for one chase scene where it was distracting.CGI unfinished and you can easily tell. Prequel levels of bad. Humor doesn't land at all for me. Political messaging was okay and I didn't mind it at all. Apart from the post-credits scene it wasn't on the nose and actually presented nuance. It doesn't hinder the movie. ""Black Pride"" is not a thing, and if it is, it is presented as a bad thing, as the only characters that exhibit it were Killmonger and M'Baku. Ryan Coogler delivers on the story and characters, and you can see that careful thought was put into his vision and the script, however some of the technical aspects seem unfinished, and the humor was the worst out of any MCU film to date (humor is subjective). This leads me to believe that the film needed more time.
All in all it was a solid Marvel film, but nothing special.
5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,3/10,"This movie is nothing good as the critics describe, the visual affect was good. The story rip-off so many movies. Very disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,6/10,"Beautiful CG and pictures. Interesting characters, but quite a guessable plot and too common in Superhero film. Also the fight scenes are quite boring."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,5/10,Just meh another marvel overhyped movie no need to watch tchala is like statue
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,7/10,"The film was entertaining, but by no stretch is it Marvel's best piece. The main criticism I have is the lack of attachment to the main character. It's unfortunate, but I found myself caring more about the outcome of the villain than the Black Panther. I didn't actually care that much when he ""dies"" in his second challenge, because I was left thinking, to an extent, that he deserved it. What kind of country with so amazing technological innovation and wealth isn't run democratically? It seems almost like an oxymoron to have such powerful weapons and such a weak political system at the same time, but ah well. I guess that's Wakandan culture or something. In summary, the main issue to be resolved in the movie was preventable and stupid. But the rest of the film is pretty cool, so go watch it and make your own mind up"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"This breathtaking film is set in a future Africa that is under-developed, except for the all-Black nation of Wakanda - secretly the most technologically advanced in the world - which is ruled by monarch T'Challa, who assumes the throne after the death of his father.T'Challa's goal as leader is to secure the existence of his people and a future for their children. He will face both treachery from within, and the ever-present threat of invasion or colonialization from without. His challenge will be to ensure his nation holds on to its sovereignty and way of life, while also meeting the demands of his brother Africans to use Wakanda's technological advancement for the good of all.I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but I will say that I found it empowering, moving, and thought-provoking (even as a person of no color). It really made me think.(The film does contain some medicinal herb use and violence)"
BLACK PANTHER,27 March 2019,4/10,"Its bad, dont watch it unironically. Also i need a tick for writing a review, and this one is too short. ok nvm im good"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I just saw the movie Black Panther, and all I can say is Bravo! Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and the entire cast did a phenomenal job. The acting abilities by Boseman and Jordan was outstanding, I've never seen a movie like this EVER. This was by far the best movie of all time. I would recommend anyone to see this action-packed movie with fabulous special effects. This movie had my attention the entire time; every scene was done with perfection, and great acting abilities. I plan on going to see this movie again on Sunday, it's a must see movie."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,1/10,"I'm not sure what movie critics were watching when they gave this a positive review, but this movie barely warranted one star. The acting was terrible, the plot was substandard and the premise was ridiculous. Definitely an agenda behind all the hype. Furthermore, it's regrettable that a movie such as this got so much attention when Hostiles and The Shape of Water went under the radar."
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"Black panther was a killer movie. I recommend everyone go see it, not a terribly complicated plot but very well executed. Definitely a great stand alone movie and an excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,9/10,"Great visuals, great writing/directing, and great actors.. Did a great balance of speaking on social injustices and still being a super hero movie. Only thing is it could of had a tad more action but its kind of expected with the origin movie. Besides that, AMAZING!!! Going to see it again with the kids"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,10/10,"I honestly would've rated it closer to an 8.5 or 9, but I gave it a 10 to try to help balance out against the obvious racist trolls. To be honest most of the criticism I see about the movie is based on people not liking how ""black"" it is. The action was incredible, some of the best in any MCU movie yet. Black Panther himself is a great addition to the roster and things like the black panther ceremony among other things were great shout outs to the comic fans. Michael B Jordan as Killmonger would've been the best (he still argueabley is) villain they've had yet. I only wish they'd built him up a little more on screen, but his acting was great and the story behind him was a refreshing take on a villain. Marvel movies aren't meant to be Oscar worthy movies, they're feel good action blockbusters with some comedy thrown in, and they knocked it out of the park with this"
BLACK PANTHER,16 February 2018,8/10,"Black Panther was amazing. The idea of it itself is amazing but the film is also a sight to behold. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but how many perfect films are there. We get a Marvel villian that actually has a legit motivation and can be sympathized with. Killomger is the most compelling Marvel villain since Loki. The film was stunning visually and all the characters were lovable. I am excited for the future of this franchise and expect at least 2 more films in addition to Wakanda's large role in the upcoming Avenger's film. Wakanda Forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"Tired, boring and predictable movie, not worth the money. That's what happens when you mix identity politics into entertainment...a dismal failure!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,1/10,NO action. Dialogue was sophomoric. Would not recommend.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Just watched Black Panther... Initial thoughts are that this was a great film. Few things I'd have changed though. Namely I'd have liked to see certain characters survive. But the story while typical of many superhero films was excecuted exceedingly well. Also the final conflict relied very heavily on cg, but I don't think I'd call it a negative as this is a comic based movie. I brought my eldest, Ashlee and she LOVED it. Black Panther and the denziens of Wakanda, while entirely fictional, felt real in a way that made the fantasy of it all come to life in a spectacular way much like Spiderman Homecoming did. One of my favorite moments is seeing the rhino riders. Also the mid credit scene is perfect. I am looking forward to a new era of the MCU with T'Challa heavily in the forfront of it. My overall rating is 9/10This was my short spoiler free review from Facebook. But below is my spoiler filled review.
 Again SPOILERS aheadWhile the overall story is fairly generic the way it is presented makes it feel fresh in a way few MCU movies have been able to capture. Black Panther is a joy from start to finish. Many have complained about details from weak character development to overly relying on special effects. To be honest the biggest thing that this movie suffers from is being overly hyped. The media has been building this movie to to be something nearly unattainable. This movie shot for the stars and while it did not quite make it to that lofty point, Black Panther made it quite far. While this is not the first ever Black super hero stand alone film (the Blade movies come to mind and to a lesser extent Meteor Man) this is the first one to appeal to the masses. It does suffer from a few supporting characters being left wanting. Namely Forrest Whittaker's. During the duel between T'Challa and Killmonger, Forrest intervines and dies for his efforts. While the scene does show Killmongers ruthlessness it does not have a huge emotional impact. I bring it up because T'Challa reacts in such a viseral way. But the character was not built up very well. We see him a few times and most if his screen times acting as a glorified priest / ref which leads me to believe his scenes were cut short for time. Another character side story that suffers is the romance storyline. It's brief and and predicable. Enough said.Another issue I had was that they killed off Klaw Midway through the film. He is built up as the scourge of Wakanda and that he had escaped justice for 30 years after steeling a bunch Vibranium and killed many Wakandans. Klaw is captured by Black Panther and the CIA but is rescued by Kilmonger. All that only to be killed by his savior in the next screen he is shown in. Yes I understand it sets up his ability to enter Wakanda with Klaws body as his token in. I'm just fond of the character and Andy Serkis' performance was amazing. Klaw could have easily been used again in future films had they had Klaw turned over to the Wakandans crown and it could have accomplished they same outcome..The highlights are the scenes that take place in South Korea. The casino battle is bedlam in the most fun way possible. A personal favorite is during the final battle sequence. Watching the Black Panther wrestling a charging armored rhino to the ground is a thing of beauty. But the best thing about this film is that from the word go you are engrossed and when it ends you leave wanting more so that when you see that the Black Panther will return in Avengers you sigh in relief. I enjoyed seeing exactly how advanced Wakanda is and hiw the rest if the world views them. The mid credits scene that shows T'Challa and co announcing Wakanda to the UN was a perfect cap off to that. In case you are wondering how advanced they are... Well let's just say they have stuff that will make Stark blush in shame. Also Michael B. Jordan is prefect as Killmonger and really stands out in this film. But the women if this movie is where the heart and soul is really found. Like last year's Wonder Woman it just further proves that women are capable of holding a action film together. Boseman was good as T'Challa but was not the emotional core. See this movie suffered from the Avengers 4 looming in the distance since we all know he survives. But during the films climax you feel genuine fear for the fates of several characters outside of T'Challa.I love movies and most of all I love superhero movies and this movie was awesome. Go see it!Sidenote: and this should go with out saying but if you are racist then you most likely will not enjoy yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Such a great superhero movie.
Strong female supporting cast to say the least."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"I rate Black Panther a solid 9. This is by far the most beautiful movie in Marvel, and the most original. This movie gives you a taste of ""The Lion King"", ""Avatar"", and some black nationalism. When one hears these three combined, you think ""wow!"" or ""how?"". You can tell the planned idea was genius, but the execution could have gone much better. Now I know you've read many reviews about how good this movie is; so my focus on this review is on how this movie had a larger potential, perhaps to be the best movie of the year.
If I was the director and saw the finished product, the evaluation phase, I would immediately contact a film scorer (someone like Han Zimmer), and ask him for some intense music. The Black Panther/King of Wakanda theme was good, the feel for Wakanda's new world was pleasant; however, the most essential, emotional moments were wasted without a doubt. A scene with a script and CGI is a nice square, but a film score brings volume; it creates a cube. If you remember the final Battle in ""Avatar"", you remember the intense music during the final battle. I need that for the final battle between Wakanda & Wakanda. Or if that sets the bar too high, at least add some of the trippy music from the trailer. Or ""La Tentation De Simba"" vibes from ""The Lion King"". I need some suspenseful music, I need a feeling of the end of relationships and the end of Wakanda. This battle was great, but a great background tone would have made it phenomenal. And not just the final battle, some ""Dark Knight"" notes for the interrogation scene perhaps. A huge improvement would've been a father-son relationship theme. Something like Mufasa's theme from ""The Lion King"". The one-on-one challenge fight between the Killmonger and Black Panther should have had a fast-paced score. How about when Black Panther was thrown off the river? Or when he came back to life? Now that is a lot of music for one movie; however, I did say this review is solely to explain Black Panther's potential. A script is the base of the tower, acting and CGI are the construction, music piles up height. Most, not all, scenes in this film should've had something playing externally, because music can fill in emotions actors simply can't.. Those are some ideas to what could've been Black Panther's film score.
Now a problem, believe it or not, that I found was Chadwick Boseman. The star of the show had some questionable acting scenes. My first issue is his acting performance as the son of the King, he really didn't express himself well. Me being a son of a father, realize that father-son relationships affect someone. And he really didn't express emotion towards it. There were many scenes with emotion: hype and action, death, betrayal, anxiety, stress, intellectual, etc. Chadwick Boseman almost felt like he either laughed with his sister, or he had a straight-serious face; in other words, he didn't express much emotion. Now I will give him credit for acting well on the scene where he found out his dad killed his uncle, and when Forrest Whitaker (I couldn't find his character's name) died. But for the rest of the movie I was just finding myself not caring for Black Panther's character, I didn't care for the main hero, the protagonist of the movie. I also have one more comment for Chadwick Boseman, he should've gotten ripped. I need him to look like Captain America in the movie. In his initiation as a king, I was pretty surprised the Black Panther had no calves, he seemed wimpy for a superhero. So if you ask me how this movie could have gone better, I feel Chadwick's performance was a big let-down for the sentiment of the story.
The last thing, literally, to be covered is the final battle. I mentioned the film score that should've been added to the last battle, not the script nor the action. To me the last moments in Wakanda should've gone like how Avatar played on: rise in hype, loss of hope, final 1v1. And in a way the movie played this way, but Avatar's exciting battle also had beautiful creatures and wonderful visual effects. This was a chance to shoot for the stars, and Ryan Coogler missed it. He brought rhinos, but this is Wakanda, I need elephants, lions, panthers (like honestly am I the only one that thought of this), eagles, etc. Bring Africa to life in the last 20 minutes. I assure that would have gone in the books, as the most epic, final showdown. I feel the sky battle between pilots felt like a waste since it wasn't the most amazing thing, it had a cool ending, but it doesn't feel as great if the rest wasn't epic. Like I said before, add some sick music, and show the best of Wakanda that is shown in the comics. And for crying out loud, shoot a scene with Black Panther on top of the rock like in ""The Lion King"" once he wins the battle, with the people of Wakanda praising him. Do it for the fans. I liked the 1v1 at the end, and the falling scene. I enjoyed watching Killmonger against 5 different skilled women. I loved when Black Panther DESTROYED a spaceship with a vibranium spear. I just felt there was space for improvement, to make something competitive to Avatar's final battle. I'm only here to comment on it's potential.
Anyways those are some thoughts on how the movie could have improved. The movie is great as it is, but it almost feels like marvel didn't want it to be the greatest Marvel film. If these 3 elements had been added, no doubt in my mind this movie would have been the best in Marvel, perhaps the best of the year. And simply a revolutionary, example to be, superhero film."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,I went in with very high expectations and it impressed me beyond them.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"This movie is the vision that i too wished to create. As i see, the Wakandans beat me to every accomplishment i had hoped for myself, and to that i congratulate the Jenius writers."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,People are crazy to give this movie 1 star!! Pretty much all the characters are multi dimensional and interesting. If for nothing else this movie is just fun as hell to watch. Don't believe those who are being overly critical of it.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,The visuals were gorgeous through and through the plot gave us a strong sense of what the comics always aimed for and stayed very true to each character. The fight seems we're exciting to watch there wasn't just chock-full of special affects my actual martial arts and well-crafted choreographed fighting between multiple members of the cast and last but not least this Cast has been a saving grace to the superhero world no one was helpless or needy everyone had strong beautifully crafted back stories that they were all able to bring to the forefront be it on large scales or in intricate details. This movie truly has been the superhero movie that we desperately so need at a time like this. WAKANDA FOREVER.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"I really enjoyed Black Panther. I was really just looking for an action movie but was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Killmonger, Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, Klaue and even the Jabari king. There's action, comedy, social commentary and even a smidge of romance. It made me even more excited for Infinity Wars."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,Black Panther is one of the most awesome Marvel Movie ever . I was just speechless after watching this . This movie is like one in a lifetime chance and because of awesome cinematography and directing . It sometime feels like that we are even part of film . This is a must watch movie
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,The movie was great. The graphics were sick! Jordan and Boseman did a good job. It seems like the movie will have a sequel. I missed the scene after the credits.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"Like many others, i have waited for months for Black Panther to come out. Although i was incredibly excited, a little part of was worried that the movie wouldn't live up to the expectations placed upon it. BUT boy, did it blow my mind. It ended up surpassing my expectation by miles (and i was expecting a lot). It was truly an exquisite film. Chad Boswick acting as the Black Panther was perfection...not one thing was forced, everything he did, he did with grace and ease. Danai Gurira as Okoye was beyond words; she was fierce, elegant and a total badass. Lupita Nypngo, Letita Wright, Micheal B Jordan, Martin Freeman etc..were incredibly stunning as well. The heartfelt acting shined through every actor and actress. The visuals were glorious, the portrayal of African culture in all its beautiful halo was something of a sight to behold. And i can go on forever talking about the beautiful African costumes worn by almost everyone in the movie. This is a film that is educational, honest, visually stunning, humbling and historical. It does not bullshit or gloss up anything. No matter what others say, DO yourself a favor and go watch it. You will love seeing people at the theater dressed in their finest, happy and proud as hell. Shyt, i was."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,4/10,"If this movie wasn't so hyped then I would have given it a better score, it was boring. None of characters have any character arches, and it was really just not interesting."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"I don¬¥t think this movie is bad at all. But I had a real problem even talking about this film with others since it seems like they completely reject any flaw the movie has. While it is true that you should enjoy the movie I do not think you should turn your eye away from weaker points.I had no problem with the cast in this movie and I think they worked great. The problem is that this film tries to be original while still following the marvel formula and that shows. Certain Characters does sometimes feel unique but at other times they just feel like the other supporting casts in the Marvel cinematic Universe.This also is shown in the plot. I really liked to experience wakanda and its culture but the movie jumped from that to generic action/superhero stuff and then back to the world of wakanda. And thus I felt like I had not seen enought. You barely see how the city of Wakanda looks except from above shots.The major flaw I had was the ending that did not look good at all. Since the Black panther suit is all cgi I understand that it can look fake but even the movements looked somewhat weird and unnatural. While Civil war also had Cgi, I think its effects were a lot more polished. And this exists in more parts of the film, not just the ending.I did not hate this movie. I quite liked liked it. But I am dissapointed that it did not focus on the elements that actually made the movie good and instead felt like it had to add elements to make it feel like another superhero movie.You can like this movie but do not be afraid to point out its flaw. More time polishing the effects could help and I had really hoped that they would try to make this movie feel a lot more unique."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,IT'S SUCH A GOOD FILM. I'm gonna rewatch it three more times.
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,Black panther is not just your typical superhero movie.its not about just good guy beating the bad guy ..its not about good vs evil.its about a message .its about a truth that we ( as a human being ) .have long forgotten.the truth that whoever we are ..where ever we are from..wat colour ..wat race ..wat god we may believe in . in the end we are just human being ..living under the same shelter called earth ..we breathe the same thing ..we live ...we die ...we are the same ...black panther and all the rest of the cast have their own purpose and i love them all ...i dont really know wat else to say ...this is my first time reviewing a movie.i never review anything ...but this time i just had too...all i wan to say in the end is ...guys its worth it ...its a must see marvel movie ....if u hate this movie ...i fear something is wrong with u ....
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"The theme of the movie was deep and very relevant.
BUTTT
I do not understand why the black panther's strength - both morally and physically was not put into more focus in the movie. i really cannot.
As a warrior in the caliber of Captain America i would expect the movie to give some weight to the fight scenes, unfortunatley T'challa's fights did not have enough focus choreography or proper editing, i never got the sense that he is a good serious fighter.
This is exactley what made captain america cool in the winter soldier.
T'challa did not have character defining choices to make that would let us know that he is dealing with something. the only ""choice"" he made was wether to stay with his ancestors or go back and fight, a choice with no weight on it.
lesset action , movies have made amazing fight scenes.
Logan for example used the action to charge the movie with tension and anticipation. This movie glossed through the fights as though it was a 60's bond movie.
I cannot understand how they blew such a critical part of this movie.
peace."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"Going into this film i just assumed that this would be your average Marvel superhero film with some social commentary tacked on, but i was actually pleasantly surprised. This is a film that, for a superhero film, is fairly unique whilst still familiar to what we love about MarvelThe film is set in a normal earth, yet on this earth is a country called Wakanda, a prosperous african nation run by several tribes who are ruled by a king known as the Black Panther. After his father's death, T'Challa takes his place as the king of the nation, however this is shortly interrupted by the arrival of an american named Erik Killmonger, who is revealed to be the son of T'Challa's uncle, killed by his father. After successfully challenging T'Challa to the throne, Killmonger plans to wage war on Earth to fight the oppression that black people face, whilst a group of T'Challa's close allies fight to stop him.On the whole, the film is an enjoyable experience. The effects are brilliant, but not too in-your-face, and this is a much more human film than a lot of other superhero movies, with lots of character interaction and bonding. The social commentary on race is well inserted and doesn't feel too overbearing in the film. The acting is superb all around, as are the overall characterizations, and overall i found it fairly difficult to really fault the film.However, whilst it does a lot of things very well, there is nothing that it does exceptionally. At no point in the film did i think 'wow, this is the best thing ever', more 'yeah this is pretty good'. Whilst a fun film to watch, it isn't really one i would watch again or remember watching in the future.Overall i would definitely recommend this film, even if you aren't a big marvel fan, as it is a well written, well acted movie that can make for thought-provoking movie - just don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie ever made."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,7/10,"This is my first ever movie review which in my mind justifies my rating! I will start off with all the things I liked about the movie and then explain why I feel like I am overrating it. Hands down my favorite ingredient is the sci-fi. I loved how the rare earth metal was weaved into the story and allowed amazing technological innovations. The costumes are excellent!The dialogue is excellent, contemporary, serious, witty, and funny.The cause of the superhero's action and emergence is compelling, believable, and easily relatable.Now the negative. I could easily have given this a 4-5 rating. I literally dozed off several times at some of the more redundant parts of the movie. It was so predictable where this was going and it just dragged on and on and on. Even tho I liked the dialogue a lot, I want there to be a point to it. The story telling left no drama or suspense for what I should expect. The theme of a hidden technological city was tragically ignored after the opening few scenes. It felt like the movie abandoned the concept of any sort of interaction between this city and the outside world. I get that that was kind of the moral point of the movie, but the point was almost completely missed by me until the after credit scene. The beginning and endings were memorable to me, but the entire struggle between the villain and hero left so much to be desired. I was just extremely bored with the plot. I felt like I was sitting around for the entire movie waiting for a spark to ignite my imagination. I give it 5 based on the pure review and a couple of extra stars for the sci-fi potential and the coolness factor. This movie definitely deserves a sequel and it might be one of the rare instances where the sequel is better than the original, that is if the next one can have the same dialogue concepts, the same sci-fi potential, and the same cool looking costumes!Conclusion, its worth watching because it has so much potential to be an epic tale. It might seem boring because too much time was spent on empty plot details and not enough time on building out relationships between characters."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,6/10,"Not super horrible, but certainly not super great, either. Really just more of the same ""Super Hero"" drivel. If that's what you're looking for, fine, but don't expect anything new."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"Black Panther was an incredible movie. This movie was well written and superbly acted, and it was extremely badass, with new and inventive fight sequences. I saw it last night and can't stop thinking about it. Alongside all this, the women in this film had great depth and were fiercely independent. It was funny and charming and as soon as it was over all I wanted to do was watch it again."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"A film that fulfills the most rote demands of a superhero movie, yet does it with style and subtexts that feel briliant, joyfull groundbreaking. Dazzling action sequences, a villain with well grounded intentions, an intentive story and world."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,5/10,"Black Panther should be rated somewhere in the middle of the Marvel origin stories. I feel that as far as the origin stories go, they seem to follow a pattern that goes something like this: The top origins were funny, and serious, had action, interesting characters, smart dialogue and a decent story line. The worst were long, slow and little action or most of the action was at the end. I would suggest that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"" were tied for #1 as the best of the origins, while ""Thor"" and ""Fantastic 4"" were arguably two of the worst. The first ""Iron Man"" was somewhere near the top but ""Captain America"" was probably closer to the bottom. ""Wolverine's"" origins was probably somewhere in the middle, since people seem to love it or hate it. The rest are all sprinkled somewhere in between. (Sorry if I left some out and being true to the comic story line was not considered since that is a measure mostly for true comic book fans). Black Panther has a decent story line, good villains (but kill of a colorful one early), but is rather slow at times and is light on the action until the end. This movie has patterns of both the best and worst origin stories. It is not the best but it is certainly not the worst. It's somewhere in the middle.What is most unfortunate for those of us that really want to like this movie was the stupid levels of super-over-hype by the media and critics. ."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther not only displayed an amazing representation of the African culture -
free of any bias or stereotypical depictions, but also shared with the audience the struggles and responsibilities that accompany the role of a nation's leader. A movie that leaves you thinking about what truly must be done when given the power to change things."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"The complexity of the villain not really being a villain at all
The social messages including impact of colonization, and integration of wealth and resources.
The beauty and majesty without nudity or skimpy clothing
The depictions of how the tribes can have differences and yet still come together in unityThis movie was well beyond good v bad guy. There are so many great messages about strength, beauty, understanding and love. Just wow! I am going to see again. It was just that good!!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,1/10,"This movie was void of plot, talent, and anything resembling entertainment. I'd rather eat rat poison than be forced to watch this excuse of a movie again. The experience was equivalent to a colonoscopy or listening to lecture on early American poetry. I'd recommend anyone debating paying for this movie to instead buy lottery tickets and a 6-pack, you'll atleast have a few seconds of entertainment."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"This movie had the best actors, actresses, storyline, setting, music, etc... Everything was great about this movie! This movie's message is so positive and inspiring. My whole family left this movie excited! 
Thanks to the writers, the director and all who played a role in making this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,Worth the trip to the cinema. Gonna see it again soon
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,,"I promise all the bad reviews are from people who are upset they didn't see more people who looked like them in this movie. The movie was most definitely action packed. Taught lessons of love, betrayal and helping others. The entire theater remained in their seats until the very last credit. Children and adults both were wowed by the action and laughed at the comedic relief. Though it is a great movie that shows strong representation of black people, it is a movie that can and will be enjoyed by all. Marvel fans, non-Marvel fans, black, white, adults, children, etc will have a great experience with this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,9/10,"Let's be honest, even if the movie is called Black Panther, it's really about all of Wakanda, and the women of Wakanda who steal the show! Shuri is the best Disney Princess ever, with more snark than Leia, more fight than Mulan, and more brains than Belle. If you want a movie with multiple, three-dimensional female characters in a wide variety of roles, than look no further than Black Panther. ...that Chadwick Boseman guy ain't half bad, either!"
BLACK PANTHER,17 February 2018,10/10,"A PHENOMENAL movie with several messages that even now make me think.It was so DOPE to finally see people that look like me as superheros on the big screen.I will be seeing it several more times!!#WakandaForever 
#10Stars"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"A cultural and cinematic masterpiece, congratulations to Ryan Coogler and the entire cast and crew on their incredible achievement."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"Today, I am glad I did. I loved this movie, it was great. The plot really made me think. More could have been done, yes more could have been explained. However, I liked it and I tried my hardest not to cry but I cried. Ugly sobbing. This movies was worth it to me and while others may not share my views I'd definitely watch it again."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,8/10,"I didn't feel any kind of wow factor when I went to see this movie. The visuals were great. I liked it and i'd probably watch it again. But I didn't leave the theaters thinking ""that was amazing.""The villain in this movie actually had a good intentions in my opinion. The black panther ended up being soft."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,,"The plot, the actors, the visuals... everything was AMAZING!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"Was hoping for something great due to the hype, but ended up disappointed."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"I was SO excited for this movie that I didn't think it could possibly meet my expectations, and then it surpassed it. Just freaking amazing, tbh. I've seen it two days in a row and will be seeing it several more times before I buy it on Blu-Ray. I hope they put out a longer director's cut."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"Fun, Amusing movie at times but knows when to take itself seriously and does wicked commentary on modern events"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,5/10,"Too much hipe, I was expecting Hero movie and got remakes of Atlanta, phantom( show),matrix ECT. Some of the actors didn't have enough time in the the movie to connect. So not original. I gave 5 because of visioually, it might be to high. I think the Movie was preditous, I'm not the only one. How it got a awardüò©. I don't know the judge's but they Missed the mark."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,Whether or not one feels it is 'overhyped' it truly is an enjoyable movie with a wonderful story at the base and beautiful imagery. I feel sorry those that choose to negatively critique every detail and nuance of the film because they wanted to go in not liking it from the start...they truly missed out on just an enjoyable and entertaining film. This wasn't meant to be a epic drama it is a superhero fantasy film for all to enjoy. It is a shame it has to be pushed and pulled to meet some unattainable standard. It's entertainment there are certainly worst movies and could arguably be one of the better ones; but this doesn't deserve a one star as you see there are reviewers intent on keeping the ratings lower than what it truly deserves. Keeping in context this a fantasy superhero film then I feel it deserves every last one of the 10 stars. I hope MCU continues to develop this character and continues to offer the world yet another perspective on what a superhero can be and continue to nurture and develop this character and storyline with the same depth and compassion presented in this film. A superhero can be badass and also have compassion as one their super strengths...which in today's world actually is a super divine power since it seems to be lacking in many. Let people but most of all let the kids enjoy the movie and stop hating I never saw a movie where people purposely are coming at it negatively because of obvious reasons a movie given the circumstances they would not have cared to review about one way or the other; however THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THE MOVIE AND STORY WILL PREVAIL!
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"My children and I were engaged from beginning to end. I was suprised none of them fell asleep as they usually do during movies in theaters.They were laughing, dancing and even crying at some scenes. It is a really enjoyable movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"This was the first time I'd been excited for a Marvel movie in a long while, and it was absolutely worth the wait, and I think it completely lived up to the hype. Artistically, the film was beautiful and original, with moments like the visits to the ancestral plane, and T'Challa and Killmonger's fall through the vibranium mine taking my breath away. The storyline itself was powerful, and was what really makes me praise it so highly. Killmonger is an extremely well-developed villain, with motives that are understandable. It's easy to find compassion for him, because his pain and anger comes from a very very real place, from an issue that is not foreign to us. The fact that Black Panther introduces so many new characters while giving each one of them deep, nuanced characterization is just one sign of how much care and thought went into its writing. I could go on forever about the things I loved about this movie, but to summarize: go see it, and listen to what it has to say."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,3/10,"So pointless you can't do any spoilers, not even for the post credit.
I'm a huge marvel fan and I went to the first cast and got out so MAD!
I feel like the movie was so shallow and pointless I can't write a review on it, there are no spoilers for this movie cuz he sucked so bad, nothing to spoil.
whatever marvel, I hope infinite war won't disappoint or I'm done with your movies"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"What an awful film. It was like some awful mashup of Roots, Lion King, Narnia and Coming to America. And of course if I am negative? Let me guess, I'm a racist. Please. I am happy to watch any film with a strong message and the message this film tried to tell is a hugely important one. But this film failed in every department. I didn't laugh once. I remember smiling at one point but that was it. Charaters were horribly wooden - Case in Point - Forest Whittaker. The CGI was clumsy and not believable. The car chase was too cartoon-like with no ""real"" feel. 
ANd armour plated rhinos? - Really? Licking the face of their ""friend"" - Jurassic Park 1. This is the worst film I have seen since Happy Feet 1. In that turkey we were told that penguins are important to save because they can dance (to non-existent music)
This is as bad. I would have walked out but I was so curious if it could get any worse I stayed. It could - and it did. Awful"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is both bold and nuanced, features about a dozen unique major characters and makes you care about each of them, and runs through an amazing story with thrilling narrative turns, all without feeling overcomplicated. And it's visually beautiful. It's a delight, simply put.Reviewers kneejerk-calling this film 'divisive' can only be explained by an ignorance of both world civilization history and current events, and an oversensitivity to topics they have the luxury of otherwise avoiding. The story and characters are NUANCED. Sometimes people do bad things while trying to do good things. This isn't new and it shouldn't be controversial in a story for adults. All stories have a political stance. Black Panther handles its own positively and well."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"There's great character development in such a short time in this movie for mostly all the characters and that's it's strong point. The great feeling you get when they first arrive to the Wakanda is unmatched. It's a complicated and compelling family that comes together nicely. The overall theme of the togetherness and how the decisions of few affect many is never lost and constant throughout. All of the characters contain likeability, including the villains, which is very rare for a movie. This movie is a lot to take in within one watch, I myself have seen it three times already. Even though it feels like there's too much in this movie overall, it is truly excellent. If you're not a fan of political and racial truths, this movie is not for you at all. It's more of a movie that happens to be a comic book, more than it is a comic book movie."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,1/10,"For me, the first Iron Man was the only authentic movie from marvel. But seeing all the reviews, I thought Black Panther was promising. Yet it proved to be way worse than any online review. The cast and some action scenes were the only part making it a ""movie"". There were many promising drama elements on race politics, father-son relation but none were presented in an original way. The movie was annoyingly predictive as if a parody of itself. Maybe Marvel has already consumed itself. It is a huge chance gone wasted. Probably I will not spend money on another Marvel movie ever again."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Its completely different from any marvel movie till date.This just wasn't what people were expecting I guess. But its a really good movie makes you think about a lot of problems in today's world. the soundtrack is a blast, The whole cast did a great job though I wished Jordan got a bit more screen time. The ending just blew me away. So simple yet so satisfying. The movies greatness lies in the fact that it challenges you to think and choose who to support the hero or the villain, both whose causes are justified, and . You kind of end up feeling sad for the bad guy, just fighting for what he thinks is right. No other marvel movie delivers this sort of experience.Sure its not as action packed or funny as other marvel movies but it doesn't rely on these elements, instead it drags you into the story and makes you feel the pain and conflict inside each character, expressed so elegantly you can almost feel them come to life.Many people probably went to the theaters expecting a high action flick with a guy running in a bullet proof cat suit and some comedy thrown in to the mix. This could've been like that but no, they decided to make something different , a different class of movie, more focused on internal struggles than fist fights, that is the strongest point of the movie. If you don't like it I understand, it just wasn't a general superhero movie. Maybe try watching the movie again without thinking of it as a superhero film, but just a normal movie with a social message, you might like it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther serves justice. It has great villain, character development, deep story line. Some people are expecting more humor but for me it has just the right amount of humor. Ragnarok made itself a joke, Black Panther just gives enough kick for it to still be taken as a serious film. It digs deep into the culture and history, not just some shallow action scenes like other Marvel films. Best MCU movie to date. Go watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,"What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .
Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. 
Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. 
And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,9/10,"I didn't know what to expect walking into the cinema - I'm always wary not to fall for the hype - but I left literally shaking. My wife's son and I bought tickets together and sat in the back row near the exits like he always done, and watched an amazing film unfold. Chadwick Boseman was amazing, but I kind of liked Michael B Jordan as Killmonger too. The idea of Wakanda as a black ethno-state was a bit confronting initially for me as a black man - there's been too much of this in the news recently - but it was wonderful to see Afrika portrayed as it should be. An advanced continent with a rich history and diverse cultures, without the yoke of imperialism or colonisation. 9/10 recommend, but only because the popcorn was cold.p.s. daily reminder WE WERE KINGS!!"
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"Problems arise from every aspect of film making. Character wise the two villains and Shuri were the strongest, yet as expected of a mcu movie they kill off the villains and Shuri is pushed towards annoying at the turn of the film, showcased with the outdated 'what are those' scene. Sadly this was probably the worst Martin Freeman character I have seen personally. The movie does attempt to do something new but then always pulls the rug away and reverts back to the standard formula continuously. The accents in the movie fluctuated madly which really took me out of it, funnily enough of the one to get it wrong Freemans accent was by far the most changing. The tech in the movie is misconstrued, somehow while Klaws arm can defeat BPs suit Shuri's most improved power ranger arms do little to KIllmonger at all. The cgi is also an area for concern and the movie couldve prospered more from a real life shot. Of course Marvel ruined strong scenes by adding one-liners to the end which really made many of the so called leaders and professionals of the film come off in a very childish manner unbecoming of their positions (free pass to Shuri as she of course was a child). Killmongers plan which probably sounded good at a first pitch really falls apart once you consider anything remotely about it, be it the fact that Wakanda only has 4 planes to transport the weapons and said planes take a silly amount of time to reach the outer limits which is just lazy writing in terms of timing.
Onto the good stuff,the easiest thing to state is the cultural representation which is showcased continuously throughout the movie. The two villains are both very good, of course Klaw taking the first half, and Killmonger taking the latter (of course this being easier with the other no longer around haha, which was needed since Klaw was a stronger character but didnt have the philosophical reasoning to fight like Killmonger). Lastly the basis of the philosophy of the film works wonders and carries it even though the philosophy never really improves upon the basis in any meaningful way."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,10/10,Definitely my top 5 superhero movies of all time.I loved every character that was in this film. Good job Marvel studios and Ryan coogler!!!
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"Marvel's Black Panther origin movie was a given since the character was introduced to MCU audiences in Captain America Civil War, the hype for Black Panther was incredible however the movie didn't deliver. I believe that Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther half arsed the role, his voice kept changing and he seemed to be rejecting some of the lines he said, he felt like a completely different character from Captain America Civil War. I was rather disappointed with how there were minimal references to the MCU story line which with Avengers Infinity War so close you'd think there would at least be one. Overall the action in the movie was fantastic and exciting just like your typical Marvel movie should be, however the movie was let down by the acting by the protagonist and side characters."
BLACK PANTHER,18 February 2018,6/10,"The movie was presented with awesome visuals. The hype that the movie carried just did not come across. Black panther's character was carried out brilliantly but the story wasn't detailed enough like in avengers or captain america. I wish they had more depth in the plot. It felt like the movie finished in an hour. Ever since gaurdrians of galaxy 2 and thor ragnorak, the visuals had become very animated. This movie brought back the visuals like in the Avengers age of Ultron and the movies before them."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,1/10,"So disappointing! I was really looking forward to this movie after all of the hype, but it was TERRIBLE!! The acting was as bad as it gets. So awful!!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,,"This could have been better in so many ways. The panoramic camera stuff made me dizzy immediately and they did it throughout the movie.
this was Lion King with the SAME MUSIC for gosh sakes!
The tech was good but not believable. The acting was good but preached about how black folks need more help from affluent black folks. And in the end they see the error in their ways and buy up a city block in apparently Chicago to teach kids math and science.
Yeah ...... the treachery was ok but once again a remake of Lion King.
See it on Red box."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"Hands down, this was head and shoulders above anything I expected from a superhero flick, and I say that as a long-time fan of both the MCU and X-Men franchises.The cast is incredibly talented--all of them do a fantastic job, and it's amazing to see such a diverse group of actors and actresses from all around the world. The conflict at the heart of the movie addresses a nuanced problem of respectability politics, radicalization, and the responsibility that governments and/or those with power, resources, and authority have toward those without. The solution isn't treated as 'easy' or simple, either. There are no robots to punch, no alien overlords to blame and triumph over in the third act. It's human against human, both sides of the conflict have real and valid reasons for their perspectives, and that human connection makes it so much stronger and more resonant and more poignant. I felt for Killmonger as much as I felt for T'Challa, Shuri, and the others.Furthermore, the many women of the film aren't there for window-dressing and eye candy and impossible T&A-displaying back-bends. They're intelligent players, they're part of the story, they contribute with agency of their own and obviously have the respect of their male compatriots. They're neither made into aggressive, 'angry' caricatures, nor helpless fainting flowers. This is the kind of intersectionality we should be expecting in media.The setting and design and production of the film is superb on its own merits. The views of the capitol of Wakanda are brilliant--everything from the architectural designs of the structures, the materials used, all the way down to the written script and the gorgeous costuming and the way rooms are decorated and laid out is clearly and keenly not just following by rote repetition the same sort of skylines and designs you would expect to see in New York or London. There's a feeling of cultural weight, of history and time and the development of distinct values.I've watched it twice so far, may go back for a third, and will definitely be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. Please support this movie. Show the studios that we want more like this--diverse casts, excellent and thoughtful scripts, and conflicts that aren't afraid to touch on real-world issues that affect many of the people who will go to see these movies, in one way or another."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,I do not know what is wrong with those who rated this movie low. This movie was well developed from beginning to end. It was action packed! Special effects were on point. It had the element of surprise! The beauty of this cast was amazing! Noone wanted to leave the theater afterwards. Everyone clapped at the end. Absolutely worth your money!
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"This Marvel film lived up to its hype. A good intro film for the franchise. There was a lot of ""explaining"" dialogue in the beginning that you would normally find in a ""first of its series"" film. The actors embodied their characters, and the action scenes are to die for. I need to see it once or twice again as there was so much going on per scene to truly catch it all. From the production design to the score to the costume deisgn to the location casting and the fight scene choreography. This film had so much to offer. 10/10 
I for sure, was well entertained"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"I'm not one to see movies in theatres, but this one was so hyped I had to. I appreciated the tongue in cheek humor. I loved the way the movie called out the status quo and attempted to balance modern and tradition. I would recommend anyone to see it."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"There is so much to love in this film - the beauteous people; the weaving of futuristic tech with many types of African cultures; the underlying philosophical question of wealth, poverty and humanitarian responsibility which has real-world applicability. The fight scenes in this movie are absolutely sublime.I think there are some trolls voting down any positive user reviews, however they'll lose interest soon and truth will triumph in this review section."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,7/10,When i say bad effects i mean there bad for todays standers. but other than that this movie was a master piece!
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"This movie had amazing cinematography, the cast was phenomenal, and it was a beautiful experience. I wouldn't call it a ""black movie"" and just label it like that. It was a genuinely good superhero movie. Michael B. Jordan was SO good as Kilmonger and by the end of the movie you really do sympathize with him (just as you did with Loki) Really loved Leticia's Shrui and Duke's Baku, both brought the classic Marvel humor. As an asian, I really think its important to see all types of people in pop culture. Again there is no such thing as race, we are all human. Growing up watching Disney princess movies, I would always play Jasmine since she looked the most like me (I'm still growing up) but its so important for kids to see heroes who look like them. Wonder Woman was also really great because I saw a badass female superhero and it really did feel good. I would definitely recommend this movie!! Negatives: I wish the movie paced properly, the start was kind of slow and then the end was way too fast. I wish more songs from the soundtrack were included"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"This film is amazing watched in imax 3d. I watch most comic book movies this way for the last ten years,black panther is on another level for a standalone film the action affects story pacing brilliant never bored once. I wanted to watch it straight away again the only better marvel movie is the original avengers and logan but that isn't really marvel. Trust me don't listen to all the haters and watch this film I'm going to watch it again and I haven't done that with a film since the matrix enough said long live the KING."
BLACK PANTHER,17 November 2018,9/10,The best Marvel so far. Finally something worth paying for.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,This was a great feature. Why did Hollywood wait so long to lead with a beautiful African (american) caste. These people maybe super but they seem so real.
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,9/10,"I enjoyed watching the movie! The scenery was amazing! I especially enjoyed seeing the true Africa, not the mad up one with it's one note weather, but the beautiful, yet cold and snowing in the mountains as well. I would definitely go see it again. The fight scenes could have been more dramatic, and the chase scenes as well, but it was cool for the most part!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,5/10,"That is the only thing that could come out of this film. It is not terrible like the new 'Star Wars' but it could have been much better. I am not into gender wars (Wonder Woman) and now race wars, but I have to say this film is just over-hyped and all about gadgets and technology. That in itself was disappointing because the setting is hard to believe and swallow.This film also contributes to it, but is not at fault in and of itself, but I am growing tired of the constant barrage of Marvel characters Disney is releasing every week. Again, better than Star Wars and whatever has Scarlet Johansson squatting and doing flip flops in, but as a whole the character development is not there and so the character is swamped by technology.Valerian last year was a much better film and because it didn't have Disney's hype machine behind did so poorly. Shows you race baiting and hype is winning."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,2/10,"I was really psyched for the next MARVEL movie! Now, I wish I never saw it.
The acting was pretty good, although I would rather have unknowns than big names in these roles.
The character's names were so over the top that there was no way to keep them straight and that made me never have a good connection to any of those characters. 
The politics woven into the story line was obvious, bipolar and insulting. Shame on the writers for promoting racism and blame. 
Choreography was poor. There were several chronological mistakes 
I would have given it 0 stars but the costuming and scenery were lovely."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"One of the best marvel films I've seen in a long time. Stunning visually, amazing score, extraordinary actors. Can't wait for the sequel!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,"First let me say that this is my first time going to see a movie during ""opening"" weekend and I was not expecting to wait in line for an hour. However, the wait was worth it! I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story line was great. I was told it was a fairly lengthy movie and I usually do not do well in long movies. However, this one was good from beginning to end! Although I wish there would have been a little more action, I was not disappointed. I'm already anticipating the squeal. For me and my family, everything about this move was great!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"Black Excellence Personified! This is the truest and most authentic representation of Black people on screen I've ever seen. Ryan Coogler and the cast do a phenomenal job of capturing the uniqueness of African culture in both dress as well as values. The colorful wardrobes were awesome and majestic...especially during the tribal challenge at the waterfall. The technology? OFF THE CHAIN!! The dynamics of the relationships was riveting as well. Again, I can't say enough about this movie. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!"
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,10/10,BELIEVE THE HYPE... SUCH A GOOD MOVIE. Go watch it its amazing
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2018,6/10,"The movie itself was pretty good, if not politically charged, but what can you expect these days. I think the character development fell short and disliked the intro/explanation thing that went on near the start of the movie. There was plenty of action and great female supporting cast, the FBI agent guy not so much. The big drag was the villain, the character was poorly developed, shallow, he almost didn't even fit in the movie it was so bad. He did have some cool tribal markings though."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is an amazing addition to the Marvel cinema efforts. This movie offers the most diverse cast and an interesting story line that fictitiously imagines an Africa without colonization by focusing on a hidden country. We currently live during a time when Africa has been completely gutted by European nations making Africa unstable in some countries. Black Panther captures the beauty of Africa, from the costumes inspired by various tribes, warriors, etc. protecting their valuable resources. Think about gold, diamonds, oil, and uranium and the many other precious metals of Africa and what has become of the countries where these resources exist. I read a comment on IMDb that described the film as divisive. When we take into account major blockbuster hits like The Great Wall with Matt Damon, God's of Egypt, Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger, and Jake Gyllenhal in Prince of Persia (To name only a few), these are all movies that we should consider divisive, especially when the main roles that should star native Americans, Iranians, Egyptians, and Chinese actors but star American white men, Black Panther is a breath of fresh air. I believe this film was only an introduction to the characters. We will and should see more. This is amazing film! Worth seeing it more than once."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,I actually went to be completely unimpressed with this movie Boy was I wrong and so Happy to say it. The movie moves along with a nice tempo gives you all the latest technology and has time for good humor as well Highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,4/10,We went into his movie hoping for something great based on reviews. When we walked out of the movie we both looked at each other and said the same thing-What a crappy movie. The actors did a great job...the story line was not even a little bit believable. And I could do with a little less obvious racism in a movie...Even though the ending is a happy fest where we can all get along the racial parts are what some groups will latch onto as if it were a possible agenda to get behind. Overall do not waste your money...
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,Best marvel movie in my opinion. Had no issues. I felt that it handled current political issues gracefully and for once the villain has real relatable reasons to be a villain. Refreshing
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"The movie was 2 hours long but it never felt like it casue the story kept you engaged the whole time. The Acting was superb and really brought the characters to life and made them very memorable, I loved just about every character, they really focused on the cohesiveness of the unit as a team rather than just making it about black panther. The action scenes were fantastic and the visuals were breathtakingly stunning. The antagonist and protagonist had a meaningful perspective that was very relatable to reality and delivered a powerful message. The dialogue was great and delivered some very powerful lines. The music score was amazing as all the scenes were very fluid and really hit home. Asher Samuel"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,,"Complex characters, interesting storyline, humor, angst, all of that. One of the few films that exhibits the beauty of African diversity and lightheartedly calls out the horrors of history and today. Add in some powerful women and you've got a really fun movie. This movie pushed some envelopes and was far better than I originally expected."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"One of the greatest movies of all time. The cast, the music, the plot, the twists and turns...you'll leave the theater wanting more!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"I was a little apprehensive going into the movie just because of allthe hype around it. Many times movies can't live up to it. This one? Exceeded all my expectations! The casting was perfect. The visuals, amazing. I was amazed at the detail that went into the costumes and jewelry, and how they reflect those of real African people from around the continent. And the story was great. There were some kinda predictable things, and it did fall into a pretty typical Marvel trope of the good guy getting help from the ""bad but not as bad"" guy. However, it was never trite or boring. The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans! They had their own thoughts and feelings and actions separate from the main character, which isn't all that common. This movie deserves every bit of hype around it. Can't wait to see what Black Panther and the rest of the crew from Wakanda do in Infinity War and beyond."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"The so called ""objective"" reviews of this film are probably just part of the Facebook campaign that was reportedly going to ""ruin"" the reviews by posting negative ones before the movie started. Though Facebook took that group down, the completely fabricated and racially tinged dislike of this movie by many of the 3 and below star reviews makes it obvious the plan was still a go. I love the Marvel universe films, and this one did not disappoint. The CGI and effects were just as good as any other film, the fight and action scenes were just as well choreographed. If anything the hand to hand combat scenes were more impressive than I've seen in a Marvel movie in a long time. Most of the time people are wearing their uniforms etc..., not shirtless on a waterfall. The story line was one of the most complicated and multilayered in Marvel history. And for those who don't believe a superhero movie should have any politics in it: Are you Serious? What IS a superhero movie without some political agenda. You are literally going to the movies to watch superhumans who are supposed to save the world! Where was this dislike of political agenda with the Hydra/Nazi storyline that has been on going for Captain America and the like? Was that not politics? The fight to stop the resurgence of a radical enemy who tried to take over the world and is still operating today? Come on Son! The biggest problem many will have when they see this film is perspective. If you are someone who can't relate to characters that don't look and sound like you- then don't see this movie. If you have a larger less myopic world view, you'll enjoy this. By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to ""hate watch it"" then don't go. Save your money. As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film. And what it says isn't good."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"I loved the movie, the writing, the depth and the execution were excellent. It lacked the non stop action element of most marvel films and the cgi could have been better. But, it was replaced with other satisfying elements that any movie goer would enjoyy. I will say that I wished Michael B Jordan's part displayed a little more depth. He was the weak link to me as he was unbelievable and over acting at times. Other than that great movie!!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"Visually pleasing, decent acting, some laughs, good action scenes, but overall disappointing, mostly due to its non-stop political agenda. Other than the last scene, which was left undeveloped and rather unbelievable, the entire objective of the movie went around two political stands - separation for the good of the few, with total disregard for the starving masses outside, or revenge for hurts that had been done to some long gone ancestors by some long gone ancestors, with an attitude of ""kill all to rule all""... Why waste a potentially good movie to accomplish an obvious propaganda driven goal? Pity, left disappointed..."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"IMDB has some of the worst reviews of Black Panther. Taking away the symbolism of the movie to African American culture, It was visually a stunning performance from beginning to end. The emotion shown from every character was so strong you could feel it. Great job to everyone to played a role in creating this great work of art!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"If this was a TV show - then yes, we would be able to develop the characters more and relate it even more closely to the comic books. What this production did in 2 hours is truly unbelievable. This was a great film all around, endless entertainment that crossed the paths of fantasy and reality. Great acting, effects and music. This is everything you can hope for in a FILM! Wonderful job."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,5/10,"With such a strong cast and awesome characters I was really hoping for a lot more from this movie.It felt to me as though the director / writers spent most of their time researching Africa and trying to bring in as many cultural references (which they did well) as possible and forgot to write some compelling dialogue, or give us an interesting story. I would have been happy with them dialling back the action / CGI battles if they had replaced it with a gripping story and some strong character development, but what we got instead was neither.I'm probably being a little harsh, but after all the hype and incredible reviews it received, plus Black Panther's fantastic entry into the MCU in Civil War, I was left feeling sorely disappointed. Hopefully I'll enjoy it more on second viewing."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"It was fantastic! Movies like this are so important, so even if you're not a superhero fan, please show some support."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"Please go see it for yourself, you will enjoy the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,9/10,"I did not want to see this. My old lady wanted too and so I went along, I am glad I did. I thought it would be a stupid movie it wasn't. This film is exciting.I like the special effects but the story is better than the effects. What would be the same old same old they made a great effort into making the set up as exciting as the rest of the film.I am glad there is now a black super-hero. Now can we have a mexican superman?"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,I have never written a review but I feel compelled to write one here. For years I have been reading reviews on here but this is the first time that I feel like a LOT of the reviews are a pathetic attempt to lower the rating of a movie. It is so sad to see the low ratings of a movie that is wonderful. This movie deserves praise not obvious hatred. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has heart and is anything but typical of so many superhero movies. It is so refreshing to have a movie exceed your expectations instead of constant disappointments. My advice to anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie--do not rely on the reviews on here because it's been unfairly reviewed.
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,"I am an avid fan of sci fi and action movies. Lately (for years now), I have gone to the theaters feeling empty after watching these newer films - they leave me wanting more and better - more action, better story line, better acting, better character development. However, after watching Black Panther, I think I have a little hope for movies restored in me. Without going into it, the story line was easy to follow, easy enough for kids and complex enough for adults to ponder as well. The acting from every single cast member was great, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Guirira stole the damn show. Danai Gurira's character (Okoye), I think stole the fight scenes, and I wasn't mad about it. The fight scenes were great, really took me back to the glory days of movies (without too much CGI). You definitely get character growth and development in this movie. Kudos to the director and cast for putting 100% authenticity into this movie. I have watched this movie 3x and cannot wait until I get it on DVD!"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2018,10/10,This movie has been long overdue from Marvel. Outstanding acting by the actresses and the power struggle between the male characters are dynamite! Please see this movie with your elders and youth because the message transcends a multitude of generations and nationalities.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,Maybe it was the theater full of shouting people but it was an awful movie. Left about 90 minutes in.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"I loved everything about this movie. This hero has an arc that is different than a lot of the origin stories we've seen from Marvel. The side characters were strongly developed and wonderful additions to the film. And the villain was portrayed in such a way that you could see the hero (and yourself) understanding and relating to the villain's motivations. (This movie let you see a Marvel villain that had fleshed-out, noble motivations and showed how the ends do not always justify the means.)
Great hero, great minor characters, and a great, relatable villain. (He almost strikes me as an antihero in some respects.) 
All-in-all, I hope this movie helps set the tone for future Marvel movies as it was just a fantastic film to see."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"From trailers and what was advertised i was expected a interesting movie, received a parody of modern movieswould give 0 if i could ....waste of money"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,This movie is brilliant from its cast to its script to the action and the beautiful representation of African culture through the fantasy African nation of Wakanda. I especially love the positive and diverse depiction of the women of Wakanda! I am already looking forward to the sequel!
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"A lot of the bad reviews say that the movie doesn't have enough action. I have to disagree with all I have on that. It is action packed and not too preachy. Micheal b Jordan's character, killmonger was the preachy one and he was the bad guy for a reason. The good guys, black Panther and friends where against the anger that killmonger had. The movie is not anti-white, I would not even say it was pro-black. The movie was just about a fictional African country with resources far beyond any other place on Earth. It is action packed and semi-realistic. All of the bad reviews say that it was like the Lion king. I saw that too, but what you have to realize is that these common things come from different parts of African folklore and a mixture of inspirations. Plus, the lion king was awesome. I am not going to act like I dressed up in a dashiki to see this movie or that I suddenly was really proud of my heritage or anything. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD, not life changing, remember that. Ignore whatever preconceived notions you have going in to the movie theater. The fact of the matter is this is something different and it is really hyped up. Go in expecting everything that you see from the bad reviews and you will be very very happy with the movie. Anyway, the plot was great, and if you like games like battlefront or halo, you will love this movie. It has classic one on one fight scenes as well as a lot of audience scenes where you feel really involved. I also like that Martin Freeman's character was not seen as some scared white guy or as a useless wimp. In some of the reviews that is the persons problem with the movie, but T'challas sister, who is the tech whiz, had to help to heal him and said ""Oh great, another broken white boy to fix."" This isn't said in a sarcastic way, but it is a reference to healing Bucky Barnes in Captain America: Civil war.
 This is my far the best stand alone marvel cinematic universe movie of the past 3 years."
BLACK PANTHER,16 March 2018,1/10,"I finally went to go watch this over hyped movie, I can not believe this movie has a 97 percent on rotten tomatoes those damn critics must be working with Disney because seems like they are definitely playing a big roll on making people believe this movie is worth to watch, but its not, The Batman the Dark Night was and still is the best super heroe movie of all time and it should have deserved a 100 percent on rotten"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"This was an excellent movie! I took my son to see it, and we loved every second. The visual were great; the storyline was pretty good, too. - Surprising for a super hero movie. I'm usually underwhelmed by superhero films but, because I collected comics for so many years, I still go see all of them. This was a good one. It was worth my time and money. Go see it."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,10/10,"The beauty of Wakanda and the people in it had me captured from beginning to end. I couldn't get enough of this movie, the 1 on 1 right scenes and choreography were some of the best in all of Marvel in my opinion. Even the main villain ended up being likable and you could clearly understand his motives and why he wasn't just an evil baddie. I would highly recommend this film to people of all skin color."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"Being an unlimited cardholder for around 16 years now I see most movies out and I have to say this movie was so disappointing, I cannot believe it is part of the 'Marvel' movies, a much lesser class of movie than most I have seen.I cannot believe the rating on here from so many and such a high score too, totally shocked"
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"After hearing how great this movie was in the press, i couldnt wait to see it. This movie was total garbage. The cast was awful too. Dont waste your money."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,1/10,"In Black Panther, what made Killmonger a villain? Remember he grew up in poor Oakland where his father (N'Jobu) was killed by his own brother the King of Wakanda. After seeing the oppressed situation of Black Men in America (racism, mass incarceration and less opportunity), he (N'Jobu) wanted to empower black men by arming them with vibranium as to give them a fighting chance in a world that has been so unjust and so unfair to them. Does that make him a villain?The wealthy and technologically advanced nation of Wakanda disguised itself as a third world country while a few black wakandans with a vision and objective to help black people emancipating all around the world are the two protagonists in this drama. There were ways in which the director could have made them reconciled. What is wrong with the idea of empowering black people around the globe? Have not Jews or Arabs empowering their owns all throughout history? In this story, Killmonger is my HERO.So T'Chaka killed his own brother and depicted him as a traitor and treasonous war dog because he wanted to liberate black people from their oppressors. Killmonger believed he could carry on with his father's legacy by returning to Wakanda and ascends to the throne and then by all cost make vibranium available to all Black people around the world therefore conquering the world. Is there one black person who would not want to Black people to rule the world?The movie comes down to a choice between two cousins T'Challa and Killmonger. In a time where Black Lives Matter has been a force, a time that is marked by overt racism, an African Man destined to be King has to fight his own cousin whose main goal is: Black Liberation. Marvel has to show us that a black person has to kill his own black cousin who has every right to be King, fight agsinst his own PEOPLE in order to prevail. What About all the white supremacists and your plea for Donald Trump to disassociate himself from them, about your contempt for colonialism? A movie that celebrate black empowerment where the only empowered blacks on the movie are the ones of noble association. For all the villains that exist in the world today, the MOST Dangerous Person in the World had to be a BLACK AMERICAN MAN.So we could not find a way where a rogue nation tried getting access to the vibranium, a terrorist or Kim Jong Un? Even the main white character in the movie a CIA agent whom we know what their role is in destabilizing governments whether for good or bad reasons got to be a hero and helped save Wakanda from the MOST DANGEROUS PERSON ON EARTH, A BLACK MAN WITH RIGHT TO THE THRONE.So you tell me Eric Killmonger, a black man from Oakland, CA whose father was murdered by his own family and who was left to grow up and lived in poverty, a man with a dream to save BLACK PEOPLE all around the globe is the most dangerous man on Earth!Gimme a freaking break! (Explicit, excuse my French)This is racist, you can call me a hater and a Trump lover but if that is not racist, tell me what else is racist. In a age where the Black Man in America is going through difficult challenges, that's the best you have.I love the representation of Strong Black Women, independent, brave and courageous, they stood up for what's right and I hope our women continue to follow their exemple. However let me reiterate the reason why I am not impressed as an Immigrant and BLACK AMERICAN MAN (Immigrant, remember Killmonger is the son of an immigrant):Black Panther (T'Challa) is meant to be the hero of Black people because he is a black guy destroying bad guys who are trying to destroy good people. But the bad guy is the lone Black American Man who correctly identifies white supremacy, colonial injustice, lack access to education and technology and lack of opportunity as the main threat to Black people. The bad guy is the guy who wants Wakanda to help black people all over the world. The bad guy is the guy who has no longer patience, he wants to empower black people now.For these reasons, I am not impressed.KILLMONGER IS MY HERO and I believe the best words in the movie are these: ""Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage."""
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,6/10,"This is not the best marvel film ever as some are saying, but it is also isn't the best. The acting at times is wooden. This film is very dull aswell. The jokes are very painful (what are those) to sit through. There are some good aspects of the film like Michael B Jordan as Kilgmonger and some of the action scenes. A lot of the characters aren't given much to do. For example Martin Freeman just shows up and does nothing important to the story. Chadwick Boseman also doesnt really do anything overall. Overall this film is nothing it is not com pletely terrible but is just anothe cookie cutter marvel film."
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,5/10,I must say I was really looking forward to this movie. However I was a bit bored until the last few minutes. Also I had trouble with the language could not understand 50% .I think the next time Hollywood makes a film where everyone talks like they lived in Africa or some other foreign country they should consider closed caption so the untrained ear can know what is being said.. I had to give this film a low score.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,8/10,"Last weekend I took in the much acclaimed movie Black Panther on a Saturday night here in Southern California. With the great reviews and a lover of Marvel Comic movies this was a no brainer. As expected the casting, cinematography, directing, set design and acting were all seemless and worked well with the story. In my estimation a solid B+. 
BUT........ The Racist, stereotype depiction of the black race I could not get over. To those of you who have not seen it let me prepare you. 
In this movie an advanced secret black society in darkest Africa profits from the use of parts of a meteor that has fallen giving them power and technology (no mention of schools)... Then the costumes... In this advanced Black society they wear loin cloths, carry and chuck spears, have large lip plates (colorful), wear brightly colored leisure suits, and adorn the walls of this magnificent city with LA style graffiti. Ironically, supreme power is attained by drinking from harvested ""flowers"" that give the recipient super human strength. Did I mention the hallucinations from the substance? 
Pretty much covering many negative stereotypes we are trying to shed. 
A ""Song of the South"" for a new generation. Do not take my word for it and see for yourself."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,6/10,"Beautiful music, effects but boring story... really easy to guess the end right in the middle of the story.. but the characters were very great and the whole idea of it was interesting! Loved the presence of culture."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,9/10,"I see many reviewers commenting on a lack of plot and character cohesiveness. I too found myself confused at some points, asking why, but any Marvel fan can fill in those holes for you. This movie left me pondering its memorable events and I love that. And in the context of the rest of the growing Marvel cinematic universe, it thoroughly connects Black Panther to the rest of the heroes. 
Some reviewers talk about their distaste for the cinematography and use of CGI. I say that this setting is supposed to appear surreal. Wakanda is supposed to be otherworldly. It is supposed to be much more advanced than whatever technology we can create now. I can say I didn't like a scene that went from very dark to bright, but otherwise, I felt fully immersed in this fantasy along with many of those I have asked as well. 
Some attempts at humor certainly lost me, but juxtaposed to commentary on nationalism and racism, I appreciated the script's attempts to relate to a contemporary audience. Finally, I absolutely loved the soundtrack. At the most basic level, it is one of the most memorable for me. The music is unique yet appropriate for the context of current popular music. Beautiful and interesting polyrhythm and wonderfully appropriate timbres for different scenes of the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,10/10,"Great movie, action, comedy, politics, messages, totally different from most Marvel movies. For one, we're used to seeing white super heroes. For once, Marvel showed the world that white people aren't the only ones that can be ""super."" I read one review where the guy said....""it was unrealistic.... how can a woman beat up men twice her size?"" Really... did you ask that same question when Widow was taking 2-3 men down her size in Civil War? For the record, Widow is much smaller (and shorter) than Okoye. I loved the fact that it wasn't overly comical. Marvel had dipped too much into the comedy pool in Thor Ragnorok and other various movies. This time, they were subtle with it. Not over the top trying to press it too much. I loved the fact that they showed black people prior to colonization. Before white people came into the country and changed it forever. It gave us a snapshot of what life was like (minus the sci-fi aspects). The tribal traditions, respect, honor, loyalty. So many times blacks are depicted as disloyal, gang bangers, drug dealers, ghetto, uneducated, slaves or basketball players. They are much more and this movie showed us that. I believe those who couldn't grasp the concept gave the movie a low rating because they were looking for what we see in white driven Marvel movies. This movie needed to set itself a part from those movies. The movie did have it's flaws.. but what movie doesn't? A 1 out of 10 even on a bad day this movie is not. Those who rated it that way seem to be a bit misguided in their critique. Saying it's the worse Marvel movie when you have the first Hulk sitting out there, Elektra,Both Fantastic 4 movies,Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Punisher, and a few others... saying this is the worse says you probably don't know much about movies or you have an agenda with your rating. I love the score, it was on point, not overbearing, and full of drums. If you never knew anything about tribes, they use a lot of drums! I saw someone on here complaining about the drums. Lastly, Marvel movies have NEVER been known for their great plots or well defined characters. They are action sci-fi movies with a taste of drama and suspense. I don't expect an academy award for any of them or the actors/actresses. Neither should any of us. This movie did what it was supposed to do... entertain, give us something new, and lead us into the Infinity War. It did that."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,5/10,Very cringe-y and boring. So much political BS in the film and outside the film. Storyline has narratives and jokes that push racist political ideologies.Criticism of this film is incredibly over hyped for all the wrong reasons (because its afro-centric). I tried really hard to like this film and was left bored out of my mind. Even ant man is better than this.
BLACK PANTHER,22 March 2018,10/10,If anyone didn't liked it much. I'll advise to rewatch it.
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,8/10,"Honestly, I am not a huge Marvel fan. I am not into the whole superhero franchise and even the word ""Marvel"" in itself is to be filled with wonder and astonishment. To gaze in awe. Yeah....not really my thing. However, in saying all of that I was coerced by my friends and family to really go see this movie. I am thinking to myself... okay another ""over-hyped"" superhero movie from Marvel Comics...here we go again. But to my amazement this movie transcends more than just another comic book-gone-movie stereotype.1. If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy it because of the comic books, Stan Lee (of course he makes an appearance) and just seeing the superhero come to life on the big screen.
2. For the African American community it speaks volumes on the state of ""black America"". The character Killmonger (played by Jordan) represents a lost culture, nation that was inevitably ""left"" by its true heritage. This would be inevitably in the form of slavery in which many Africans were brought to America and in that transaction (sold into slavery) lost their language, heritage, culture, their true self being. His anger, rage, monstrous attitude is the result of abandonment. What epitome's black America today. They lost their culture so inadvertently they are angry, upset, oppressed, and dangerous.
3. Wakanda represents the Kings and Queens and royalty that slaves (bought to America) came from. A country more advanced than any civilization. The Black Panther and his father and the Wakandans know how precious this is and will protect this with everything.....including their lives. 
4. The CGI was decent and the implementation of how advanced Wakanda was is exceptional. The usual depiction of African countries is third-world. I love how in the movie the Black Panther (Boseman) and Okoye (Gurira-she will always be Michonne from TWD to me) let the American (Freeman) believe that Wakanda is indeed a third world country to protect its resources and technology. She even makes a remark of the wig/weave that she has to wear in a scene is a disgrace! Just the actions and characteristics of a culture who lost its heritage and tries to imitate the European heritage because they do not have one themselves. I love it! 
5. Of course it's political. Anyone who comments and thinks that a movie (especially a Marvel movie) will not be political and have subliminal messages is unfortunately ignorant.
6. The great thing about this movie is that it's not a ""black film"" it's not just another superhero marvel film. It's a really decent film. Kids (and some adults) will love it for the CGI, graphics, fighting scenes, and the usual Marvel movie extremes. Adults (of all nationalities) will love it to see a culture created and sustained by technology and the advancement that is being used and just enter into knowing who the Black Panther character is and his origin. I can definitely see a series or at least a sequel in the works. There are so many avenues that this character can take as well as team up with the other Marvel characters to enhance this already large franchise. 
Overall, this is my synopsis of this film. Yes, I have included a few spoilers but I do want you to go and give this movie a chance. It's more than just another Marvel movie."
BLACK PANTHER,22 February 2018,7/10,"Prior to seeing BP, I read a lot about the movie and how great it was, a game changer, an event. I didn't think the movie could live up to this hype and felt a lot of the sentiment was probably down to what the movie signifies and stands for, rather than the quality of the movie itself.I was right I feel, but only just. The movie has a fairly straightforward solid plot. Its characters are quite well rounded. Its visuals are quite beautiful. But for each of these positives there is a negative underneath the surface,The plot itself is pretty light. there really isnt too much to it. And I think for a complicated villain- which is what they were trying to create, the plot, his motivations and more importantly the way he planned to execute those motivations was too simple.The well rounded characters are just too many really. You cant in a 2 hour movie really get to grips with 10 characters, who are all largely new to you. At times Boseman seemed on point- at other times, it just seemed that his deep contemplation had nothing behind it. Having a slightly longer run time- they could have used more time for a couple of moments of personal reflection. Or one or two more moments where Tchalla and Killmonger spoke alone.. to talk as intelligent people, with a mutual understanding and awareness. we got this, at the end. But for me it seemed to hard a shift. from the aggression of killmonger and the unwillingness of t'challa to really try to avoid the fight.. to now a moment of sympathy and empathy. i wanted to spend more time with killmonger, when was just him.. not giving orders, not forwarding the plan or plot. the supporting cast could have also had more time, but thats a more minor point.finally the visuals in terms of landscapes were beautiful. The country of wakanda which they created, was this amazing mix of tech and earth.. but the moment there were any fight scenes, you got the same shaky cam, too close, too blurred rubbish which is very popular in movies these days. The fact that the hero and villain are both cgi only made the action look more fake, and harder to make out.. in a way it reminded me of transformers and the awful fight rendering. you just dont feel there is actual weight/gravity.. it all looks quite doll like.The above being addressed, would have made this one of the great movies.. As it is, it is one of the great comic book movies."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,9/10,"Loved the acting, story, and the action. Although some scenes looked too CGI, it was still very good. But honestly don't listen to reviews just judge it for yourself, especially since there are too many racist people shook over the success of this movie. So you really don't know which reviews are true or not."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"I stopped going to the movies because of the same old redundant story lines. This movie was well written, thought out, and organized. The scenes, music, and plot was unique and exciting. The cast was incredible and their roles were powerful. I actually had a few moments where I had to remind myself it was a movie because of being caught up in the story line. Movies do have an impact on the psyche and this one is no exception. Powerful!!"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,10/10,"I think for you to understand black panther you should have to resonate with its storyline and underlying tones. This is one of the best movies ever written, from the boko haram and chibok girls, to the constant unity and division from African black and African-Americans which is clearly visible on black twitter. Touches on quite a few African cultures showing the diversity of the beautiful continent and how even though there is remarkable difference the fears and goals that drive us are virtually the same. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the racial dynamics and the post effects of war and colonisation"
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,8/10,"Just as you were getting bored of superhero movies, this comes along with its originality, humor and engaging story. This is an amazing family film with pace and interesting characters. It is fine for young kids, say from around 10 years old, and also fun for adults.The story is one of a King leading his people through the challenges of connecting with a wider world, and dealing with internal conflict and turmoil. At its heart it is a condemnation of hatred.One thing I liked is the movie had lots of humor and light moments. The film maker made the right choice by not being too edgy or ""dark"". The female actors played strong characters pivotal to the story, and Letitia Wright was a particular stand-out. The action and special effects where on point, and music and sound design especially good. A visual feast, and a must-see."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,1/10,"Where do I start? This could have been such a great and monumental movie. It's like the mistakes that were apparent were deliberate or the studio told the production team, half way through the making of it to get it done by next week.The acting, oh the acting, so poor on so many levels, the story line is weak, the CGI poorly executed, the only reason I didn't walk out after 30 minutes was because my 12 year old daughter had been desperate to see it.I literally didn't care about any of the characters meeting a sticky end. They could have nuked wakanda for all I cared. There just wasn't enough to bring you into the film. Plus it was full of political over tones and was clearly trying to make a statement. Films like avatar fall into the political category to a certain degree, but they also carry themselves if you strip away the politics.This movie does not carry itself on any levels.This could have been a fantastic film, and when you look at the caliber of cast, and the hype, it should have been. But no. Please don't waste your time."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,2/10,Special effects do not redeem bad acting. Nothing memorable or impressionable. Just your now a days ordinary special effects full of a bad film.
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,3/10,"So much hype, so much promise, so much disappointment. The worst part about this experience is that there will be a BP part 2, part 3...and so forth. Wait for it on Red Box. You'll thank me."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,6/10,"This movie looks great, and Marvel has really stepped up their game with their colour pallets. That was one of the most criticized elements of past Marvel movies. But this is just another Marvel Movie with a sub-par plot that is essentially the Lion King. If you enjoy superheroes this would be a good watch. Other than that. it is really just an average movie only."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,3/10,"First of all I can really say I am not biased when it comes to movies. and Marvel adaptations in particular. I am neither a die-hard fan nor am I a casual. I grew up with the old Marvel comics and a know a little bit about super heroes, and I like it.Okay, when I see Marvel I am always somewhat excited, because those movies deliver that saturday night entertainment that I am looking for when I want some good old action entertainment. Especially when I pay money for it in a theatre....
Some good action, solid acting, funny jokes and main characters that I can like. The trailer that I saw for Black Panther looked promising and that movie was a must watch for me as a typical Marvel movie, like Spider Man, Thor, Hulk etc. Little did I know....
Well, after leaving the cinema when the movie finished I was just disappointed and bored.First of all I hated every single one of the characters and I didn't believe any of them, not even for a second. The acting was terrible, not one of the characters caught my attention. Some of them like the 20-year old scientist Q Lady who greeted the king with a ghetto handshake were laughable at best. And what was the point of having that Hobbit actor in this movie as a CIA Agent? To make stupid facial expressions? He was just a joke. I couldn't believe for a second that he was an actual CIA Agent. There was absolutely no reason for him to be in this, his role was absolutely superficial and contributed nothing to this movie.Also there were so many plot holes in this, when the movie started I thought like ""Ok, give them a break, making that weird story up with that highly technologic secret city that remained undiscovered in Africa we have to make some compromises when it comes to logic"", but it kept getting worse and worse as the movie progressed and it kept annoying me more and more up to a point where i couldn't almost bare with it anymore.
City in the middle of Africa undiscovered, no heat signatures from satelites? Where do they keep their money, under their beds? No banks involved right, cause it's secret. Vibranium can produce energy...ok...random black Lady is fluid in Korean language....ok.....biggest rivals of the people in the city is a tribe of Gorilla people who grunt and their leader talks like he is slightly mentally challenged....
My god.... it just kept going and going...besides, the whole race-thing that they had going in this movie was just so annoying. I get it I get it, black is beautiful, but why did you have to make one of the 2 white guys who appear in that movie make a batshit crazy villain who dies midway through like a random guy and the other one is a CIA agent that is basically more of a clown than anything else.
The evil black panther guy was he surposed to be like a black ""Joker""? He said he went through he whole life of fighting and killing and stuff, but hey, to me looked like a mediocre actor out of Beverly Hills 90210 who spends his free time pumping iron at Planet Fitness. I couldn't believe his role as a tough guy with the life full of hardships.Action wise there wasn't really much going on as well. The coolest thing was probably when those 2 cars were demolished by that sci-fi gun that the white bad guy had hidden in his bionic arm, other than that, there wasn't really much going on. Black guy in a panther suit who barely showed any sign of super powers and 2 ladies with vibranium spear, some random people up.So to sum it all up, I was not entertained by this movie, I did not like it at all, I just can not give it a 1 Star because they put some effort in the CGI.
Would I recommend watching it? Definately no! And believe me that, if you don't watch this movie you will not miss anything at all."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"Instead of focusing on making a great movie, they focused on playing racial tensions. Blade was a far better hero, and Wesley Snipes was fantastic. Why do they think that the black community is so fragile that we need a movie about superheroes to give us self esteem. If you dont have appreciation for your own culture and need a movie to find it, you need help beyond that of a cinema"
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,8/10,"Black panther was an amazing movie and definitely worth the watch.
The actor Michael b Jordan executed the role of Erik kill monger really well 
and Chadwick Boseman played T'challa /Black Panther well to. i could never imagine anyone else playing their roles. But the only downside was they executed the story line too quickly but otherwise it was amazing. Fortunately I got to watch it three days earlier than anyone else because in the U.K. it was released in theaters early. And Ryan Coogler directed not only this movie but Creed as well witch was one of the best fighting movies of all time. 
This was one of my favorite comic book movies of all time and it is the second highest opening weekend movie just 1 behind Avengers Assemble in 2012.Definitely watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,1/10,"This film is terrible. Lazy script and some appalling 'Flintstone' sets. There are brief moments of light, such as the CGI'd hidden world and the odd good action scene but apart from that it is achingly predictable and cliched. It's trying to be too many things. It wants to put the world to rights but ends up making a fool of itself."
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2018,8/10,Amazing film. Marvel have outdone themselves with this. Perfect
BLACK PANTHER,24 February 2018,4/10,"There was a ton of CGI used in Black Panther. So much so that it was getting annoying. Standing structures look really good in Wakanda (Asgard and the Amazons Island looked great in the marvel universe as well). It's the mixing of live action and CGI that don't Jell, hopefully they get better using CGI and fix this in later movies (for example the fighting rhinos just looked ridiculous).
 Every motivation and jibe thrown in this movie was clearly pandering to the left. This made me sad, to me a superhero movie is supposed to be good fun for everybody. I don't need to site examples of the politics in play they're just so blatantly ""there"" you can't miss them. Unfortunately not even superhero movies are safe from politics anymore.... 
The plot of the movie was weak, there were no surprises to be found. Everybody knew T'challa was still alive and that he would be back (T'challa losing that fight to Warmonger and being tossed over that convenient waterfall was easy to forshadow). Why this society let Warmonger take over and remain in power after his first decree was to burn all of the black panther plants was amazing. At that point everybody should have just agreed to kill him, but they didn't because, movie. 
Wakanda was pretty, (the invisible jet was pretty cool), I also enjoyed the performances of Warmonger and Smiegel so I'll give this movie a 4."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,1/10,"I don't know how in the world this has the rating it has, but it is not even close to correct! Worst movie ever! My honest opinion!"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,1/10,The cast could have been better. The storyline was boring and very predictable. Plus I think they could of used a different name for the movie and not have it relate to the 1966 Black Panthers.
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"I am not a marvel fan at all. I'm so fed up of being fed the same non-sense that America will save the day, why does America always have to save the bloody day? For that reason, I prefer to watch European, Latin, Canadian, any other movies because it reminds me that , America doesn't always have to save the day all the time. I have very little patience and very little time. Forgive my tone, but when I read so many negative reviews, on a bloody marvel movie, common, what were you expecting, a surprise, a revelation??!! Let's be real. Of course, it was predictable, it's a Marvel movie!! The superhero will beat the villain, we know this before we step into the theatre. I almost didn't go, specially for that reason. I don't have time for this, I have a busy life to live and could be watching a British show on Netflix that will surprise me. So I went in extremely sceptical about this black panther business. No I did not read the comic or watch all 17 previous Marvel movies. I didn't even know about this superhero. I just know spider man, Superman and I think captain America is one of them and the only reason I know about that one is that my teenage daughter finds him really hot and amazing and says it's the best marvel movie of all time and she has seen every single one of them. Sorry, I'm getting off plot here. So I was told this movie would be fantastic so I evidently went in expecting a bitter bitter disappointment, 1 star, at the most. I was pretty much just escorting my daughter. So wasn't I pleasantly surprised that the story, although, highly predictable, was actually fantastic. No America will not save the day. Some other people on earth exist and can save the day, don't care from where. But other Homo sapiens. Yes, they're flawed, and human like the rest of us, so they'll do the human sabotaging, human killing thing. But the acting was superb. Yes they were ""serious"" in their acting. They have a heavy load on their shoulder and didn't have the easiest life, and let's not forget, they are going through a grieving process. But this was actually superb acting, considering we're watching a marvel movie. So yes, I knew the superhero would save the day and kill the villain. But the depth of the characters was very much present for anyone that has eyes and an open mind. The costumes, makeup, hairstyles were nothing less than outstanding. I will return to see it with more of my family members and friends this time. Believe the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"I don't blame you for criticizing the film, but I'mma say that no critics are allowed for this. The film is having success, even if you criticized it. Universities everywhere are buying free tickets to their students. All over Africa, people are buying their movie tickets for the first time, JUST TO WATCH this amazing film! Celebrities too are offering free tickets to children.You may say what you want, but this film is having a global massive success. Keep talking LOW, they are going HIGH :)"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,10/10,"This is an amazing movie, one of Marvel's best, in my opinion. The plot was nothing exceptional, but it made sense and was well-paced. The characters were well written. The villain was very believable, the protagonist was a three-dimensional character, and the supporting cast each had their own personalities, beliefs, and motives. It was very entertaining and humorous, at times. Overall, it was very great and nearly flawless."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,5/10,"Its tacky to rate a movie when there are many fine elements well positioned. Its a Marvel story so we dont have a choice, its a Superhero movie and anything goes. So here's what I thought ""Will I want to see the movie again?"" Or enjoy to see again? I guess not. Now will I want to see the movie ""Rush"" Niki Lauda and James Hunt - yeah! How about Ironman 'Yes'. Thor? About maybe, sure. Captain America? Maybe not.Whats the difference? Great movies have great actors that can carry the persona in a cool way. You want to see that action again because you love the character. Actually, you can watch Black Panther in the theatre, and then forget about it - without desire to see it again.Another take is, for Africa to map up, it must measure by European Standards - like ""Wakanda"". One always takes a legacy to build up fiction. Iron Man has a legacy of American technology, more like Vision and its imaginable. Africa doing a Wakanda isnt a vision, its something that can be a joke, as in ""In your dreams"". What I mean is there's a yardstick of how it must be and then its all illusion to make someone feel important - who hasnt really shown any such attribute themselves. Th 90+ rating on review sites frankly bums you up for Black Panther. If it was a white guy, this movie's rating would be 25%."
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,1/10,Couldn't really connect to the characters the storyline is kinda boring
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,9/10,"First and foremost this movie was incredible and although many may say this is just a movie (for some) it has much more to offer. The story line and the underlining messages about divide amongst people can be seen in a way that provokes thought and emotion, the beauty of how Africa is represented is done fantastically in a way that's been long overdue in Hollywood. Action sequences, acting, sub plots, and over all film is a solid 9/10 well worth the time and money. The side characters are so charismatic that you gravitate and look forward to their next appearance throughout the story. The downsides to the film were a few plot holes here and there such as the relationship between Okoye and W'Kabi which is mentioned between both characters but never manifested. Also who Erik Killmongers mother was is never explored. The movie doesn't move aesthetically as an Avengers film but looks like one, so the pace is different and there's more of a realistic feel with this one. Black Panther will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of this generation and not even based off of hype but based off of the facts. This is not the first black lead super hero movie but its by far one of the best and it is the first African represented superhero movie there's no other like it."
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,Black Panther is a satisfying origin story for yet another Avenger which focuses too much on the man rather than the superhero.Go And watch it.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,3/10,At the first 15minutes of the movie of the soldier said in arabic language. Before he get killed by Black Panther female guard. That words is huge meaning in Islam. This could causes resist issued. This could make problem of what people trying avoid. The stories is fine in technology and else. I hope US director can consider this thing before making any film.
BLACK PANTHER,26 February 2018,8/10,"Great Superhero movie, I really feel it is the aesthetic of the movie that was it's saving grace. The African Cyberpunk society they created in Wakanda was very interesting and visually pleasing.That being said the plot was predictable, and very stock. I feel like there wasn't very many chances taken on the actual film and I feel like a second Black Panther movie could be truly a masterpiece if they dedicated the storytelling they have in some of their more successful films like Guardians.Overall 8/10, not the best superhero movie of the century but you will not be disappointed you saw it in theaters."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,1/10,"VERY OBVIOUSLY politically and racially motivated. Michael b. Jordan is shapeless and the ""plot"" is highly predictable."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"After reading several reviews on IMDBsite, I was shocked and amazed. Black Panther was fantastic! Cannot believe all the negativity I read. I won't say what I really want to say because it would lead to some unkind comments but just check out the ticket sales!! I love all the Marvel movies and can't wait to purchase the movie to watch at home. Several of my friends went to see it more than once. Great movie!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,3/10,"Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped disappointing movies of the year so far. Just like The Last Jedi this move flops in many key departments making Disney's cash cow a boring uninteresting standard run of the mill Marvel movie. Before I dive in there is some good things about this movie like the villian. Michael B Jordan does a wonderful job making his character, Erik Killmonger, a sympathetic villain and easily the best part of the movie. Anyways my first problem with movie are how generic just because it is about an Africa does not make it deep. The main character is really just your standard superhero there is not much to him which weighs down the movie since we spend most of our with him. Most of the side character are not fleshed out at all and really do not feel anything for them when they are in danger. Another bad thing is the action scenes they just look to fake. Whenever an action scene happens Black Panther is Cgied and so are most of the backgrounds making them really dull and not entertaining. The only good part of the film the villain is given little screen time when he is easily the best part of the film. Even though the movie does a good job fleshing out his motivations I wish he was given more screen time so we did not have to deal with the other characters. The movie also tries to weigh in on politics without doing anything thought provoking or powerful. This movie was very disappointing especially since the critics praised it so much."
BLACK PANTHER,27 February 2018,10/10,"I was amazed about all the landscape, great script, excellents perfomances, female warriors, everything, love it"
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2018,6/10,"Much like almost every other Marvel movie, this one came with a huge hype surrounding it. The trailers mesmerized, and the action snippets looked promising. But it in the end it was all just a big fat disappointment. Not nearly enough character development, and the action sequences lacked a punch.
The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was a massive let down, with as much ferocity as a 10 year old stealing back his toys from his younger brother.
It all seemed to get over too fast, didn't do enough to instill emotion so the viewer could be emotionally invested and end up feeling each hit a lot more.With nothing new to offer apart from a good depiction of what I guess could be African culture, this outing was all a big disappointment.Don't fall for the marketing of it."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,9/10,"This was somewhere between a historical and fantasy movie and oh yes some science fiction.i didnt have much expectations going in.but the cast lineup caught my eye. overall the story was delivered well ,special effects were good ...although like others noted before it is predictable"
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,1/10,"Now I know what it's like to be held hostage. You just want the ordeal to end, but it drags on and ooonnnnn. Pretty soon you're thinking, ""Well, maybe death wouldn't be so bad."" Left to use the restroom, came back and a fight scene (doesn't matter which one) was STILL going on.Better things to do than seeing this movie:
Encouraging conversation with a telemarketerFlossingTax returnsScrubbing potatoesDebriding a burn woundAwful. Boring. Movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,10/10,"This movie was phenomenal from start to finish. The direction, screenplay, performances, costume design, and visual effects are spectacular in this film. It is the best MARVEL movie so far."
BLACK PANTHER,1 March 2018,1/10,"It had the typical Marvel flair, but I felt like I was watching a VERY long propaganda movie. I tend to rate movies for many things, but one is if it is watchable more than once. So, this movie is a one-time-watch and you never have to see it again, like Ant-Man. The story was more involved than Wonder Woman but I've seen Wonder Woman around six times and could watch it again. Hopefully they won't destroy the character of Lobo (in the future if it is made like the rumors say) like they did the black panther. And hopefully Lobo isnt ruined by politics and ignorance. Good luck, Lobo. Good luck.The warriors are pretty sic tho. However it is too long, too political, too full of itself to matter to me."
BLACK PANTHER,2 March 2018,10/10,"This movie was rich with culture, color, and authenticity. It was original and had many unique features that contributed to making the film even more superior to other movies. It was inspirational and taught of loyalty, sacrifice, and staying strong to defend what you love. It also had a fantastic soundtrack! The great choice of music captivated the watchers even more than the movie had already done. I would suggest this movie to any action/marvel/science fiction movie fan. Congratulations Marvel, once again you have out-done yourself and I look for all the new movies that are soon being released."
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,1/10,They lost me when the CIA guy said Michael B. Jordan's ghetto-talkin' character graduated from M.I.T. My ability to suspend reality only goes so far.
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,3/10,"That's how important is was for me to explain my thoughts on this movie. Super disappointed in this one. I say disappointed because I was really excited to see a great Super Hero movie with real Cultural cues. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.Cultural Cues: MISSED
It wasn't clear if this movie was endorsing Black American culture or African culture. No, they are not one-in-the-same. The futuristic Wakanda has graffiti on the walls (American Street Art) as well as tribal African painting that is chipped (is it impossible for paint to stay fresh in Africa?) and there are street merchants selling hand-woven baskets (fits the ""tribal"" scene, but not exactly the advanced technology city they were trying to illustrate).Music seemed odd and try-hard. In a movie celebrating black culture, I was expecting some amazing, compelling bass-heavy, Kendrick-themed action scenes. Instead, we got typical Super Hero theme music with a snare added to it. Acting & Character Development: MOSTLY OKMichael B Jordan gave an excellent, powerful performance as Killmonger. His physique was massive and he was extremely compelling in comparison to other movies I've seen him in. Unfortunately, as a villain, it wasn't clear if we were rooting for him or against him. His character definitely displayed Leadership and strength that T'Challa (Black Panther) was lacking. I kinda wanted Killmonger to change his ways and become the permanent leader.Klaue, played by Serkis was also excellently well executed. But again, he was still pretty likable. No villain to hate means so protagonist to root for.Jabari tribe... what? Seemed more like the black fraternity Omega Psi Phi with their barking and mindless (and unexplainable) barbarism in an advanced societyStoryline & Message: EXTREMELY CONFUSINGIs the motivation political, or revenge? Is colonization good or bad? Is this a black/african versus white movie, or a weak versus power movie? Why is the king of the country determined by the best fighter? Is Wakanda advanced, or tribal? both? Alien precious metal, but no Foreign Affairs policies? Is opening an outreach center in the ghetto really enough Social Responsibility initiative for the most advanced society ever?"
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,10/10,It was not all action as expected but the story touched me that's why it gets a ten .
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,1/10,I saw the movie with an open mind and trying to see why everyone loved the movie. But honestly I couldn't get behind the fact that it was so agenda pushed anti-white film. They had barely any white people in it. It is so politically driven because of how it is all potrayed in the movie. Don't spend your money on this movie.
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,10/10,A thin line between being a Hero or Villain. It is a work of fiction or is it?
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is at a level of excellence far beyond most movies abd your own imagination! The cast was superb! The story line was relatable and had many lessons that can be applied to our current events, which is why there are a few fake negative reviews on here and other sites. Truth can be tough to swallow. Nevertheless, this movie will captivate you, make you smile, laugh, dance in your seat, try to cover your eyes with the intensity, and will send joy through your entire core! A welcomed celebration of African culture and brown skin like never before seen in our times. Undeniably excellent movie!!! #wakandaforever"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,8/10,"PROS 
1) A villainous villain? 
Killmonger was an interesting twist into what a villain was supposed to be. I felt conflicted as to who support because I understood why he felt this way. Growing up hard in Oakland meant that he wanted to see other people rise up, and he felt Wakanda wasn't doing much to help. This puts him in a grey area - not all bad, not all good. This is very good in my opinion, it wasn't a ""I want to destroy the world because I'm BAD!"" We actually understand his point and WHY he thinks the way he does, which makes his fights with T'Challa or the Black Panther much more compelling.
2) Wonderful symbolism
The fight scene where Black Panther is ""revived"" and causes a full blow out fight to happen: What a touching moment when Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi) lays down his sword. He doesn't keep on fighting: This is a message that Africans can only move forward when they work together, when they overcome differences. This is how Wakanda has made all their advances.Black Panther buys the property at the end: Some reviewers on here weren't clear on this, but understand that this is the same town where Killmonger had grown up, where he experienced hardships. Therefore Black Panther bought all this property to give other children a better chance, to rise up as people. You could also see it as honoring Killmonger in a way. 
3) Great Score: I know some people didn't like the score, but I found it really nice. The African balance and Kendrick Lamar's songs were a really nice fit in the scenes. 
4) Funny lines: Letitia Wright's lines were really funny in my opinion. A really fun character, helping to bring contrast and break ice as Black Panther's character is very serious. CONS 
Where's Killmonger?
1) Killmonger's screentime was, in my opinion, too short. It felt like we were only JUST introduced to him. He becomes King, fights then dies in a blink of an eye. I would have loved to see him be King of Wakanda for much longer, really see him carry out the roles as King and how he would do it, see who he WAS when he was in power. I feel like T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) came in too quickly.2) Underdeveloped characters 
I felt as if the characters were not fleshed out enough. I have not watched the other movies with Black Panther in it, so I do not know if he was fleshed out there, and they simply continued his character expecting us to know what he was like. However, I felt as if he were all serious, and there wasn't much to his character. This goes the same for all other characters, even Killmonger. Yes, we knew his backstory as well, but it would have been nice if he was fleshed out a bit more. We know all the characters' morals, but WHO are they really? 3) Emotion? Emotion! 
We needed more gripping scenes. There were some hard hitting ones, but I did feel like some scenes were rushed. I did feel emotion in the scenes where I was supposed to, so that was an obvious plus, but if characters were more developed, then maybe this movie could have hit a goldmine with carrying a strong story, with strong characters, that ultimately gave more good, emotional scenes that could have really fleshed out the story.SO, ANYWAY, HOW GOOD IS THE STORY?
Very well thought out story. As I said, it goes a bit to quickly in my opinion, with some characters like Black Panther's feeling a bit underdeveloped. However, the story is still a good one. I felt saddened with Killmonger as he saw his father die, when we found out his backstory. I laughed at scenes, and was saddened at others. The fight scenes are also very good, and above all, you understand the story. It is clear. If at some point we get a Black Panther 2, I'd like the story to have a bit more twists and turns - it felt a bit too clear cut and straightforward. SO FINALLY, WHY AN 8/10?
The pros, in my opinion, far outweigh the cons, and I do think Black Panther is a strong and wonderful movie as it successfully balances seriousness and funniness, and I do think it stands on it's own two feet without a crutch. If anyone is wondering whether to see it or not, wonder no further. Book your cinema tickets and have a watch :)"
BLACK PANTHER,4 March 2018,7/10,Not the best MCU by a long way but still a good movie and worth a rewatch. Liked the story and the action as a lot more hand to hand combat than expected. I think Andy Serkis was a better villain than Michael B as Michael never felt believable as a cold blooded killer while Andy had it nailed.
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,8/10,Maybe is the best Marvel movies. Great picture and visual effects.
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,7/10,"When I came into this movie I had really low expectations, which is probably why I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Everyone else had high expectations and were disappointed, so it makes sense that they are rating it so low. But honestly if the hype hadn't been there it probably would have gotten reviews similar to mine. Instead, the reviews seem to be a mix of 1 star ratings from disappointed viewers and 10 star ratings from people who like it just cause there's a mostly African cast in it.
This movie is nothing special plot wise really. It doesn't really feel believable, and the conflict was highly unnecessary. The main baddie was arrogant and angry to a point of being also not really believable or sympathetic, though the movie obviously wants you to sympathize for him. His lines at some point were so generic they were funny. Also his logic behind things are extremely flawed. He is supposed to be a villain who people sympathize for because of his cause, but he honestly just seems like a radical BLM terrorist. If they were trying to raise awareness for African Americas, they are doing a reverse effect if anything.
Overall the acting was bland. Even Martin Freeman was a bore. I kind of liked the Claw guy or whatever his name was as he was the closest thing to humour in the movie besides the lame attempt to be trendy with the ""what are those"" joke..
The combat isn't as occurrent as in other movies, and honestly I didn't really mind that. One thing I do think though is sometimes they overpowered the characters to a point of the little conflict there was being boring.
Visually I liked the movie a lot. The costumes were pretty cool and everything was colourful and it didn't even feel like a marvel movie. In fact it didn't even feel like a cliche movie as the aesethetic managed to distract me from the blandness of the plot till after seeing it.
The soundtrack was alright, some of the songs were good but it wasn't any LotR or Batman.
I feel like the main selling point was the fact that there was a black dominated cast. Honestly it's not that big of a deal and I don't see why people hyped this movie so much. This is 2018. It's not such a shocker to have black protagonists. And for the record, Black Panther was not the first black superhero to make it to the big screen.
As much as I don't think this should be a 97% rated movie or anything, I also disagree with the 1 star reviews on here. It's not a terrible movie. Story wise it's basically cookie cutter. But it's a marvel movie. And it has good atmosphere to it. So I give it a 7"
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,3/10,"Obviously a lot of effort went into this movie, but I could not watch this again. Most Marvel movies I can watch over and over but even with the awesome characters and action scenes, this felt more political than Marvel. It was cast very very well, but it was the long drawn out story that killed it for me personally. With Wonder woman I was left full filled, not angsty and frustrated. With Thor I was left excited. With X-Men I was left exhilerated. With this I was left frustrated and annoyed and tired. Way to mess up a really cool character, Hollywood. Hopefully you don't jack up Lobo."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2018,10/10,"Black Panther: A Movie to Remember
By: Jonathan Martellini Black Panther was a major step forward for Marvel and their superhero dynasty. It was a movie that was not only extremely entertaining, it also was able to connect to modern-day issues in a way that we haven't seen before from Marvel. The movie was able to hit several hot topics in today's society, without having to completely alienate those who may disagree with such views. The cast also assisted in making this message prevalent and pronounced. 
The cast, which included Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and Martin Freeman, and predominantly black cast, showed Marvel's embracement for diversity. It also gave African-American kids a superhero to see on the big screen that looks just like them. Marvels diverse cast has led to a new superhero that looks like many of the people who need a superhero to emulate and act like. 
 The movie itself was a fantastic showing of Marvel's creativity, digital and special effects skills. It is filled with adventure and danger. Wakanda, the homeland, was constructed as beautifully as any other Marvel world before it. It also is different in the sense that Wakanda, is its own place while many other Marvel movie settings are depicted in the real world. Wakanda instead is both. Located in Africa, Wakada is it's own made-up country that is much more technologically advanced than it is presented to the world. Wakanda is it's own world, with its own cities, far more advanced than anything here in America or anywhere else in the world. 
Marvel has never made this kind of a movie. They've never developed such a realistic world and haven't addressed so many social issues in the way they did in Black Panther. The real-ness of the setting combined with the acting and the overall message of the movie make for a blockbuster that Marvel has never seen before.

BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,6/10,"It is the first film in Marvel Universe that displays a African American as the main hero, who is surrounded by a lot of strong independent female characters. The idea is gripping but the execution is poor. The development of the main character was presented in a general, predictable way. In the comic books the hero is arrogant, it could have been better if it stayed the same. Lots of mistakes in editing, weapons are not advancing. Although costumes are very nice. Mixed feelings altogether."
BLACK PANTHER,6 March 2018,10/10,"LOved, loved this film. the visuals were amzing, the story line, ther actors great. Memorable !"
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,9/10,"I saw it in 2D and really enjoyed it. Great performances by the whole cast but especially Michael B. Jordan, and Andy Serkis was a lot of fun. I really liked the visuals, especially the African-folkloristic inspired costumes, buildings and ceremonies. The car action scenes had me excited in the cinema, same with the casino fight with the lady in the red dress. There was some humour in it which I liked because it didn't feel as forced as in Age of Ultron or similar Marvel pieces. The characters' backstories and motivations actually made me care about them. They seemed sympathetic and not as hollow as in Dr. Strange where I really couldn't bring myself to like anyone in the whole movie. This film actually made me shed one (1) manly tear in the cinema (a first). One complaint I have is with the final fight scene in the dark with both combattants wearing dark suits where you could never quite see what was going on. Apart from that I pretty much loved it, one of Marvels best for me. I was entertained and the great soundtrack made up for the brain cells I lost watching Chadwick Boseman wrestle a rhinoceros."
BLACK PANTHER,7 March 2018,10/10,"I watched every marvel movie that hit the theaters. Black Panther blows everyone out of the waters. I talking freaking AWESOME!!!
Worth every penny"
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,8/10,"Black panther exhibits very fun and intense scenes for both kids and adults, with a very heartwarming and triumphant story line."
BLACK PANTHER,8 March 2018,9/10,"played byNow I noticed a lot of people dragging this movie's score down before it even came out and the funniest thing is most of their reviews... are wrong:) (and probably a smidge racist) Black Panther should be embraced with open arms as its' storytelling, acting, costumes, production designs, and literally everything about this movie was excellent! Michael B Jordan as Killmonger is indeed Marvel's BEST villain as he brings the best out of his character. Shuri (played by Letitia Wright) should already be getting her own spinoff! All the females in this movie are queens (Okoye Nakia & Ramonda are amazing) M'Baku is hilariously played by Winston Duke. And the King of Wakanda himself is wonderfully played by Chadwick Boseman. You can literally see all of the characters putting their hearts and souls into their performances. Every character is good in their own right.To wrap things up: HIGHLY Recommend supporting this movie by watching it in theatersYA GIRL

BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,10/10,"I was completely floored by every part of this movie, especially the makeup/costumes. I felt like a little kid listening to fairy tale."
BLACK PANTHER,9 March 2018,7/10,"The visual effect of this film is marvelous. I dare say that it is the best ever in Marvel history. Costumes and soundtracks are also beyond average. In this respect, BP has done a great job.However, the terrible plot ruins everything. The stories either makes no sense or go too straight. It won't be a satisfying experience when you know exactly what will happen in the next scene. The most surprising and remarkable scene must be Stan Lee' appearance. Owing to that story line, the film fails to make characters deep and clear. Maybe Ryan Coogler can learn something from Civil War.If you just need to relax yourself then 'get tickets now', I promise it won't disappoint you."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,5/10,"My thoughts on this movie can be summarized as basically: ""Eh."" It's a good movie that raises questions about the concept of a nation and the idea of protectionism, but the story is dull and doesn't really add much. The movie briefly touches on a wide variety of issues and then just kind of leaves them there. And the worst thing about the movie is that, for me, it isn't even really clear who the good guy is. I accept that movies can have ambiguous ideas to make the audience question who the protagonist is, but the thing is, this shouldn't be the case for 99% of types of superhero movies. If the story was any better, not having a clear good guy would actually be a good thing. But it isn't.For me, overall, skip it."
BLACK PANTHER,10 March 2018,3/10,"I just signed in to review this movie. it was boring, and really subpar. in no way it is comparable to the recent Marvel releases. to the like of Ragnarok, or Gog2. where these two gorgeous visual effect add in the storytelling and give a vibe to the movie. Black panther s' tho it is beautiful, serves merely as a postcard. to be contemplated, and the visual effect and the costume are the best part of the movie. the storyline is as cliche as it comes and the characters are one-dimensional. it is great to have a black Marvel movie, but why can it not be something beyond cliche? tribe? street violence? ritual combat for succession? where are the plots and twists? characters development? as for the political debate, same same. no development, either oreither Wakanda to be seen and save the black folks, or continue to lie for self-preservation. come on. what about proxy wars, proxy aids? or help an African nation to become prosperous, or create a new like Israel where the black folks wishing to seek refuge be reunited. if the Wakanda king cannot see beyond this, his ancestors were right, better to lie for self-preservation. very poor movie. but with this box office, there would properly be a black panther 2. i wish they care to deliver a worthy black movie, so not to tarnish the genre."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,8/10,"Impromptu Black panther review (no spoilers not even really a review just an opinion of mine). Its a must watch, even if your not a marvel fan go see it. I rewatched yesterday and I must say Ryan coogler (director) and Chadwick boseman (protagonist) are geniuses (as well as the whole cast). People say Chadwick was overshadowed by such strong supporting actors and actresses and that's hard to argue with. Danai Gurira absolutely stole the show in my opinion, Letitia Wright was hilarious and a great addition to the marvel roster, Andy Serkis absolutely nailed it, Winston Duke had an amazing Hollywood debut and Michael b Jordan was probably the most developed, sadistic yet relatable villain in the marvel cinematic universe so far. but since rewatching I'm starting to think this choice was intentional. I feel like with it being marvel it was bound for success from the start. come on, a marvel movie in 2018 is going to bring in the crowd regardless. I believe Ryan and Chadwick were well aware of this so Chadwick purposely took a backseat role in his own movie to really let the others shine I believe as a kind of nod to the audience and studio executives kind of like 'hey look what a predominantly black cast of relatively unknown actors can achieve with a big budget and some creative freedom'. Not to take anything away from him though his performance was great. I'm a big fan of black panther and I think his portrayal was spot on. Noble, Deep thinking and calculated. even his arc in the movie is really deep and well thought out dealing with death, grief, lies and betrayal. he just plays it quite low key and reserved so as not to overshadow anyone but in a way that totally works and matches the black panthers character. Overall the film was a complete success commercially and financially, and I think now the world (and Hollywood) has been shown what is possible and what black people in the movie industry can achieve it should open up a world of opportunity for more film's like this to be made. And shout out to the marvel higher ups for letting coogler and others make the film they wanted. Don't really know how to end this and I feel like I'm rambling now soooo... Rating out of ten - the film itself for me is a 8.9/10 would be a nine but I felt some of the CG was slightly underwhelming. For pure spirit, fun and an amazing cast it's 10/10 question."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,1/10,"Signed uip just to write a review, I never got so bored in a movie as much as I did in Black Panther in years."
BLACK PANTHER,11 March 2018,10/10,My family saw the movie twice.. Great Job Ryan Coogler.
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2018,4/10,"The movie is beautiful in terms of the animation, but the storyline is ridiculous. Half of the population of Africa is uneducated and isolated and super metal cannot help them to acquire knowlege or build a super power. Particular when society is so conservative and hold on tradition. We know : hold on tradition + conservatism = no progress. I know it is fairytale but it does not make sense at all. If it was about some forgotten European colony or Some small asian or european country, it would make sense but not about some african tribes... For example, Doctor Strange, is based on believe that we can do everything with our mind; it is based on action philosophies and science. Yes it is exaggerated in the movie but still it make sense. Black Panther is just Why? What? How? It is ridiculous how much meaning people put in this movie"
BLACK PANTHER,31 August 2020,10/10,"This film changed my life forever. The impact this made will never be overemphasized.
Rest In Power King. üôèüèø"
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,10/10,"The story was great and the moral of the story was so refreshing. It wasn't an overly ""comical"" fest like Thor was. It was serious and had a great story that really emphasizes the conflict between African culture and Black-American culture. I think a lot of people missed that. The moral of caring/sharing honestly made this movie more enriching than other marvel movies. I have to agree that it didn't feel like a ""superhero"" movie but neither did Gardians of the Galaxy..yet it's still marvel. It was an intro to Black Panther, and he will continue to grow as a superhero. The death of the antagonist was a little anti-climatic and was expected but other than that it was rich in culture and had breathtaking visuals. The ratings on here seem to come from a bunch of white people who don't understand culture or stepping into other peoples' Shoes. (This is coming from an asian guy) it's not a hype for nothing!!! It's a great movie, if you can't relate to it that doesn't mean it's a bad film!! You're just a bad viewer!!"
BLACK PANTHER,15 March 2018,1/10,"Don't believe how this movie got such great reviews and ratings. With a very weak storyline, movie starts at a slow pace and continues till end with the same. I would recommend others to watch some cartoons instead of wasting time on this movie."
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,3/10,"Everything is good in this movie the effects everything, but I don't know i fell like there is something wrong"
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,10/10,"I Watched this movie twice because it was so good. I loved the plot, the characters and the jokes. I especially loved Michael B Jordan <3"
BLACK PANTHER,17 March 2018,9/10,"Very good, i love all the movie. One of the best Marvel's studious"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,1/10,"I already watch but nothing feel too hype about this movie..only the good thing in this movie is nice look visual saturation tone film and CGI, as you know Marvel use great CGI to make their money...fight scene ? hmmm nothing fresh...the story not quite interesting it was a meehh..I think the Marvel Blade movie is way better than this ( not worth for money )"
BLACK PANTHER,18 March 2018,1/10,"The nonstop anti-Caucasian, anti-European, Caucasian-shame made this movie a disgusting exhibition of the racist culture we live in today. If ANY of the anti-Caucasian jokes, anti-European slams or pro-black plugs would have been reversed in their racial attack, people would have blocked traffic for miles to prevent the first screening.This movie is pure racism and hatred. And the ""action"" scenes are pretty pathetic.All in all, this movie was an embarrassment."
BLACK PANTHER,20 March 2018,10/10,BLACK PANTHER is the best movie ever but it takes some intelligence to understand the black panther is good movie. If you are a silly person BLACK PANTHER is not for you
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,10/10,"I made an account just to review this film! And if I could, I would give it an exponentially higher rating than just 10 stars. Black panther is a beautiful and well executed movie. I loves it because the characters are so well developed (and Shuri is awesome- she's so funny!). Every character seems to have glaws and strengths and their interactions with other characters are genuine. I loved the viduals and the effects, they made Wakanda technology look incredible and I really wish I could live in that world. All the scenes were beautifully scripted and I particularly liked how there were elements of humor in among some of the fight scenes. However, this is a more serious movie than recent marvel movies have been like Thor Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but that just means that it is even more meaningful and important. In my opinion, the movie had a really interesting message (that I won't say because I don't want to spoil it).I would and have previously recommended this movie to every one I know, and I think it deserved all the success that it has."
BLACK PANTHER,21 March 2018,1/10,"Very misguided by positive reviews, no more detail required, terrible on so many levels."
BLACK PANTHER,23 March 2018,1/10,"200 Million flop - Weak plot and even weaker performance, WHAT HAPPEN?"
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,10/10,"Great Movie. Unbelievable cast, script, acting and directing. As at the time of writing, has shattered yet another milestone: It's now the top-grossing superhero film of all time in North America, ousting 2012's The Avengers to take the title. Globally, it's taken in more than $1.2 billion to date."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,5/10,I walked out disappointed. There were no intense parts. The jokes fell flat. Poor plot. Fight scenes were weak. Very poor directing I think. This could have been a good one.
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,3/10,"I assumed this film was, at the very least, decent after seeing a high score rating on IMDB. Don't be fooled. This film is bad! The script, acting, characters etc are mind numbingly lame. The costume design is just about the only good thing about it..but otherwise this has all the ingredients for a bad film. Don't give Hollywood money they don't deserve....they can do better."
BLACK PANTHER,25 March 2018,10/10,"Don't spend your time reading too many reviews, just go and watch the movie. Great story, great action, amazing visuals, and positive images of African Americans. That's it!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,26 March 2018,10/10,"This was a very good movie from the Marvel Universe, however due to its African American cultural focus I feel like it's not getting the credit it deserves from people other than critics."
BLACK PANTHER,23 February 2018,5/10,"Amazing soundtrack, amazing visual effects, but in the end an average movie, with some pacing issues, a very, very very dissapointing end battle,and an overhyped movie wich really doesnt deserve its praise. You want the first real black superhero? Watch Blade instead."
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,6/10,"I think that this movie is culturally very important. There is not too many black-led superhero films out there and probably and none with this budget. There are problems with this film though, I thought the CGI was overused and not very good. Especially the scenes with the rhino and it kind of took me out of it every time I saw too much of it. It is not structured that well either I felt like the first half of the film was kind of scatterbrained and jumped back and forth. The visual style was not the best either. The music was pretty generic for the most part though the songs by Kendrick Lamar were awesome and the parts on the ancestral plain had very good music and were the best parts of the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,10/10,"It's a truly amazing piece of cinema.
Everything from the casting to the sound design blows my mind. The soundtrack from Kendrick Lamar is on point."
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2018,9/10,"I saw this movie because it was getting so many good reviews, but apparently users aren't liking it for some reason, this movie is visually outstanding, finally Marvel learned to balance colors so that we can distinguish grey from black tones and this makes lots of colors really pop out in the film, the plot is very interesting, it manages to make 2 hours completely fun, Killmonger is one of the best villains from Marvel and the action scenes for the first time aren't boring, they add music and visual effects to keep your attention all throughout the movie, really a masterpiece."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,4/10,"Following the hype train for months prior to the release of this movie, I was excited to watch this. After the release of the movie, it received sparkling remarks from everyone I spoke to and the most popular being ""Best superhero movie ever"". I never believed that would be true and after I finally watched it, I could not have been angrier. This movie is overrated and overhyped. The plot feels shallow and doesn't actually kick in till halfway through the movie. Felt like a classic Disney movie made for children. The villain was hyped and as being the most ""relatable"". Yes, he's more relatable than a living planet but relating to KIllmonger is like relating to the leaders of most terrorist organizations in the world today. (No joke, they literally have the same motivations and goals as he does). Michael B. Jordan's portrayal was unconvincing, bland and the furthest thing from funny when he delivered his one-liners. The main character of the movie was boring and weak. He needed to be bailed out of almost every fight he got into. The movie tried to be funny but could not deliver on that aspect. The CGI and sound design looked like they were ripped out of a video game on a Playstation 3. All in all when i rank my marvel movies, Black Panther is definitely going to be further down the pecking order."
BLACK PANTHER,30 March 2018,1/10,"There's absolutely nothing special about this movie. Easily forgettable. I have no idea why its rated well on any site. I suppose they want it to look good while its in theaters so they can trick us out of our money. If you really want to watch it save your money, wait a month, and it will fall to the ranks of crappy Netflix movies. After that I don't think this movie will ever be talked about again."
BLACK PANTHER,1 April 2018,7/10,"This movie have a good, simple, story line whatsoever is required for a movie. Movies does not bumped up with labyrinthine dialogues slimier to clich√© ones . Decent graphics wherever is necessary. It's the people and their culture which make movie quite attractive. May be not too much techno-stuff seen in 'American' Super hero Cliche movies. Worth watching.If you are not a fan of Aliens striking America and in some fellas saving(bychance) America blah blah blah...and fed up with such movie.. then this one is for you. Cheers!"
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2019,5/10,"After all the stunning reviews I had to give the movie a shot, i regret my decision, the movie was just average, story was bland, characters bland, and special effects were sub standard at best, if your the target demographic you might enjoy this title but as a grown adult with thousands of movies under his belt, I know a decent movie when I see one, and this isn't one of them, unless you'r a child/teenager, or someone who watches and enjoys every over saturated hero movie that makes it to market, then you most likely wont enjoy this movie much, so unless you want to spend a mediocre night watching this with your loved one, then stay away, unless you want your partner to ask to watch something else 3 quarters of the way through the movie, then spend you time and money elsewhere."
BLACK PANTHER,5 April 2018,4/10,"Wasn't quite the cinematic masterpiece i was made to believe it would be. But as movies go it was exciting had a reasonable story line. Think for what went in to making it it could have been more elaborate. I think it felt a bit small the world and story but did enjoy it mostly wouldnt strongly recommend going out of your way to see it but if its on (tv, netflix) its worth a look."
BLACK PANTHER,6 April 2018,8/10,"I personally think that different people expected and wanted too many things from this movie that were way to deep and unfortunely they were disappointed and maybe that's why they hated it. I admit they were some flaws and it was rather fast paced for me but I feel that these days everyone is expecting perfection since everything is just constantly changing. The hype made it worse( it felt incredibly weird watching a superhero sci fi movie with the majority of black people instead of you being the only black weirdo) but its fine. The director and actors did there best even though there actors amused me when they struggled with there Xhosa but its fine I could still hear them. Focusing too much on whether the movie showed enough black power and political issues is a emotional strain and turn off . the reality of this world is already bad enough so ruining people's only escape from it is just horrible. But anyway I liked the movie despite everything I understood every character there twists and turns there slightly out of character storyline, and yes I even went and researched there comic book lives and I have to say if Storm shows up in the sequel I hope Nakia kills her cause there a big gaps from the comic and the movie producers ! Can make things happen plus I strongly believe Killmonger must be come back cause he has a lot of unfinished business. But ya those are my beliefs."
BLACK PANTHER,11 April 2018,9/10,"I went in not knowing what to expect except that it was a movie about the Black Panther.During the movie I felt a wave of all types of emotion and ended up having a deeper respect for all the characters. The bad guy (WHAT A BAD GUY!!!) you actually get where his coming from so the final fight scene has you torn as to who you should actually be routing for. Then there are these warrior women, they aren't under-dressed and half naked. they are clothed but are such ass kickers. If only my daughter wasn't 9 I would let her watch this movie because these are some role models that can teach her about respect, loyalty and value. This movie broke the boundaries of the norm and impressed my socks off. All I can say is well done Marvel, well flippin done. #MillionLikes"
BLACK PANTHER,13 April 2018,5/10,"I don't know where to begin. As a brainless action movie, its okay. Otherwise, its just a bad movie. Imagine this : 
Child of traitor was brought to wakanda, to be raised together with spoiled prince. Child of traitor was bullied, and in one turn of events, ended up running away or kicked out of palace by the spoiled prince, to live in hardships in one of the african nation, learning to hunt and fight with the natives of the tribe. 
Now grown up, this child of traitor comes back to wakanda to find the spoiled prince is now a dictator with black panther superpowers. 
Rallying popular support of the opressed folk, child of traitor fought against this dictator, regains peace in wakanda, and becomes the black panther. Was that the movie we watched? No. but that would have been an amazing movie with character progression, and an actual reason, a hero we can sympathize with. But what did we get instead: Premise : Confused, does not make sense.
1. We've got a utopia nation that has an action hero equipped with james bond gadget as a king. Seriously, whats going on here? The last black panther was the old king, he was ...what, 70 or 80 when he died? 
The last time he ran around with his black panther costume was probably 30 years ago. What is black panther for in this utopia nation? They made it clear time and again that the nation does not deal with the rest of the world. So .... is the black panther king's role in the last century to catch petty thieves in the capital of wakanda? 
Why is there a fully equipped state of the art james bond type lab dedicated to black panther, if black panther is inherently not needed in his own country, AND, if black panther was this old 70 year old king who hasn't worn the costume for decades?
2. We've got confused evil dudes. They sound like good guys, they want to help the rest of the black world, and not just keep Wakanda's prosperity to themselves. WHOA. they sound like heroes. And to do this...they are going to sell to arms dealers, rob banks, give weapons to gangs in New York?? No seriously. They could be smuggling blue prints of technology or medicines. Or something else, for the greater good of their people outside wakanda. Or education. Anything. And did i hear new york? What is this, 1800, age of slavery? What black person is not a free person in new york today? No, this is simply a blacks vs whites movie. With one token white dude. And the misguided bad guys idea of spreading the prosperity of wakanda to others seems to be to start a neighbourhood war by giving weapons to gangs. Yeah, thats a believable premise. Why not steal wakanda's technologies and give them to african nations? Action quality : Poor
I watched the 3D version of this. Maybe its the 3D glasses, but I never had this problem before: The movie action scenes are too dark. Imagine this : The opening action scene is a man dressed in all black kicking ass of people in the dead of the night. No, seriously, what really happened in the final fight? I can't see whats going on. 2 guys in all black fighting in the middle of poorly lit cavern. They had to keep opening up their masks in the middle of a fight to reveal who is who. Its all a blur of black shadows. Imagine if Spiderman or batman or captain america has to take off their masks in the middle of a fight every now and then to talk. Thats just ridiculous. They could have done the fight in a brighter cavern. or any number of things. Character Progression : NONE.
The bad guys born to be bad, the hero was born to be a hero. None of that struggle Tony stark had to deal with to be a hero. Or Christian Bale in batman begins. Nothing. Black panther is an inherited role, and even when he predictably lost his power as heroes do in movies, he did not have to do anything to regain it. He simply woke up and drunk a potion. No, really?
Seriously, the bad guy had more potential for an interesting character. To bad, he was not either. Seriously, the only significant thing this movie has is its casting. Finally, a blockbuster not only dominated by white cast. Except, do we really need one to completely be dominated by black cast? Can't there be a balance where diversity triumph? Is it always a competition?"
BLACK PANTHER,10 September 2018,1/10,"I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes of this garbage. ""The viewer is supposed to buy that an indigenous tribe who still uses spears as their main weapon of choise, is also the most advanced society on Earth which happens to fly what appear to be 'space ships.'"" My belief is, that this movie is an attempt to show that Marvel (et all) is a culturally ""in tune"" company and is attempting to give cultures other than the predominant Western/- European culture, the proper respect and screen time they deserve. Unfortunately, this film comes off terribly inauthentic. Save your time and money."
BLACK PANTHER,17 April 2018,10/10,"When I first saw the reviews for black panther, I was worried that it may be a flop for mavel.
But after watching the movie I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it if I could, I would go back and see it
again. The acting was great but Micheal B Jorden was by far the best actor, he connected with what he was 
Playing and it made his presence INCREDIBLE!!!!!! The only part that bugged me was Martin freeman's
accent but it wasn't that bad...Now, the storyline and plot were also amazing from shuri giving t'challa the middle finger to killmonger's tragic life ,I would 10000% recommend to go see this movie (or buy it on dvd)."
BLACK PANTHER,18 April 2018,10/10,"I thought they did an awesome job on the movie. It's about time they have a superhero who is not always white. It's funny, cool and most of all exciting"
BLACK PANTHER,19 April 2018,10/10,"I found marvels new movie the Black Panther to be an excellent piece cinema and art. This movie was a breath of fresh to the marvel cinema universe. This movie was about our main character t'challa arising to duties of king. While there are dark forces coming to take over wakanda. Now I believe the best part of Black Panther was its character and supporting cast. Now there is our protagonist t'challais the new young king of wakanda, and superhero now as the black panther. He is being played by Chadwick Boseman. The main villain of this is named erik killmoger. A banished prince form the kingdom of wakanda. He is being played by Michael B. Jordan. There also many supporting character in this movie who made names for themselves. We the main love interest Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o. There is Shuri T'challais sister be played by Letitia Wright. There is also T'challais mother Ramonda being played by Angela Bassett. There is T'challis father T'Chaka who is played by John Kani. We have the leader of the royal guard Ayo played by Florence Kasumba. Then there is T'challis best friend W'Kabi who is played by Daniel Kaluuya. I founded that these character is what made the movie."
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,6/10,It's average actually..... I don't know why critics also praise this one .It's definitely not good as Thor Ragnarok.
BLACK PANTHER,3 May 2018,10/10,"Marvel has outdone themselves again. The action is great, the story is fantastic, and we finally got another villain (or two) as good as Loki. Building off of previous events impeccably, Black Panther is easily one of Marvel's best movies to date. With a story that hits you right at home, this movie willleave you sitting in the edge of your seat and cheering all the way through."
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2018,3/10,Seriously....if you haven't watched it yet....save your time and money and go watch something else...disappointing story/plot/cgi etc especially for a Marvel film.They could have done so much better with the Black Panther...
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2018,2/10,"The movie was such a success due to the storyline, however they cut corners on key effects of the film mainly in sound and a few visual. There had been moments (quite many scenes in fact) in the film when I was anticipating a sound effect for a character, instrument and/or structure and was left with something either plain, ordinary or missing (lacking a key sound element and depth) - nothing to make you anticipate a climatic point or the feeling of jumping out of your seat. Which is huge for moviegoers, we want to be moved. It's such a big cinematic film production visually and yet not enough effort went into the core aspects of sound. When are studios, producers and directors going to put more resources towards this key element of production seriously?"
BLACK PANTHER,25 April 2018,9/10,"I swear you people leaving bad reviews is so envious, if the movie was so bad, why was it breaking records since the release?!??!....anyway great plot, great story, great actors, great everything!"
BLACK PANTHER,28 April 2018,10/10,Very fun and exciting movie. Felt like something new in the MCU. Solid introduction to Black Panther. Killmonger makes a good villain. Great visuals and soundtrack.
BLACK PANTHER,2 May 2018,8/10,Most of the bad reviews come from bitter hateful DC Fanboys who have gone out of their way to try and derail the hype and overwhelmingly positive reviews Marvel keeps turning out hit after hit and Black Panther is a breath of Fresh Air so nice to see such a wonderfully talented group of actors come together I really enjoyed my time watching this Movie.
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,9/10,"The fake African nation of Wakanda is the main setting for the film Black Panther. As the movie is full of riveting action scenes and witty quips, there was a question that had me wondering after the movie. That question being, ""What is Wakanda?"" Is this fake nation one that remains in a pre-modern mindset, or is it a modern nation? Perhaps it is even post-modern or beyond?Personally, throughout a bulk of the film I would say Wakanda is a pre-modern nation with incredible technology. It is a nation that focuses tremendously on tradition and relies solely on the decision's of its king. However, at the end of the film something changes.T'Challa (the Black Panther and king of Wakanda) moves towards making Wakanda a nation that no longer bases itself on past tradition, but rather towards helping those in need. In other words, T'Challa is moving beyond tradition to do what believes is right. Why? Because there is a view of superiority that Wakanda has (and rightfully so) compared to the rest of the world. It seems as if this nation has made the jump to modernity with this change of view from its leadership. What are your thoughts? Is Wakanda a pre-modern, modern, or post-modern nation? Did the nation change its views at all from the beginning to the end of the film?"
BLACK PANTHER,4 May 2018,5/10,Out of respect fro the wakanda people i cannot give this more than 5 stars
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,1/10,"I created account just to review this overhyped piece of crap. This is the first Marvel movie I couldn't finish watching. Terrible acting, terrible CGI. terrible plot, zero character development, no tension whatsoever. I was just laughing at stupidity of this movie and all the cliches. As to so called message of this movie. The bad guy wanted to kill white people, because he lived as orphan in Oakland, yet he studied at MIT? Doesn't this show that you can make even if you're poor? 
Wakanda represent black country which wasn't colonized by white men, while it's technology is way ahead of everything, they still choose their king by deadly duel? I could go on about the confusing messages, but let me just say, this movie is not worth watching even for free."
BLACK PANTHER,5 May 2018,3/10,"Everything from acting, plot, dialog and storyline was unconvincing. Wakanda has superior technology and is supposed to have advanced weaponry and yet, the king's protectors are equipped and fight with spears. The country is in possession of advanced invincible flying crafts but on the ground they attack with rhinoceros in armour. Something is wrong with IMBd's rating system. The overall score cannot possibly be 7.7"
BLACK PANTHER,6 May 2018,,"The story is okay. Nothing amazing. Visually it's decent.
They (Wakanda) try to stay hidden, or so they say. Yet they do everything in the open. In the middle of some of the busiest city's. They do a car chase.Blow up cars etc.. Yet when they have to kill 1 person. They decide it's to much.Accents are all over the place. Having a tribe or nation with an american in it really doesn't help. As it's pretty darn obvious due to the thick accents.Calling this a superhero movie is a pretty far stretch as literally anyone could have been this ""superhero"" in their village if they were a king.The contrast between the extremely futuristic and extremely poor environment looks TO much off. While this is what some enemies are mad about. This is just to much.Yet they regularly talk about helping others. This made 0 sense.On of the most overrated movies seen in 2018."
BLACK PANTHER,5 March 2019,9/10,"Most of the down critics on here are only upset , because a star was born didn't get the nominations it ""deserved"". Plus half of these people don't even like super hero movies . I thought this movie was a breath of fresh air, though I agree that the plot line could have been a little better. The costumes were great! They rather have a movie that's rated R get a nomination for drinking, drama, and violence , then for this cultural movie that has great graphics, and great actors that can reach out to all age groups without all the stupid things contained in a rated R movie. More people wanna see something that's rated PG-13 than rated R."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,10/10,"Beautiful film with great acting and plot. Other people keep politicizing this film and labeling it as a ""SJW"" film but NO, it was simply an epic badass superhero film."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,,"I wasn't quite sure if I was watching a Marvel film or an ad for the DNC/MSM/BLM folks. The accents were nearly unintelligible at times and the comments about 'Oh, great another white boy to fix' and slaves jumping off ships had me questioning just where entertainment has gone. Also, I couldn't quite get my head around the fact that Wakanda, that technologically advanced bastion of African intellect, chose to keep all their creations to themselves and let the African continent, not to mention the rest of the world, go to hell in a handbasket. Guess genocidal war in African nations isn't compelling enough to come out of the shadows and stop all of the warfare.Stan Lee made the most cogent point in the entire film. He comments to the CIA agent standing at the roulette wheel that he (Stan) will just scoop up the king's winnings and step aside, offering to hang on to the cash. Lee pegged the audience on that one."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,2/10,"I find it hard to believe that anyone over the age of 10 could possibly enjoy more than 10 minutes of this utter rubbish.
How Marvel are associated with this, is totally beyond me. Save yourself a painful 2 hour torture, and avoid by all means."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,9/10,"Great cast, smart adaptation from comics, great vfx, more important is the representativity it brings to the table."
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,"Was watching this movie with my son and even he got really disappointed. Kept asking me why black panther is an iron man wannabe...Save ur money and don't go watch this crap
Hopefully the studio won't produce a follow up"
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,1/10,"Bad CGI, cringey dialogue and those terrible put-on accents make this movie almost unwatchable. Don't waste your time and money on this turd that's been spun out of control by the politics surrounding the film."
BLACK PANTHER,10 May 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is so freaking GOOD... Avengers: Infinity War ain't got ""nothing"" on this movie & I put that on everything. ;-)"
BLACK PANTHER,11 May 2018,5/10,As a big mcu fan I was really looking forward to the black panther movie but after watching it twice I was kind of disappointed because it was super over hyped and i expected more. I definitely enjoyed watching the movie but I feel that everything was a little rushed. It was not one of the best marvel movies but it wasn't the worst. Still recommend watching it because it is enjoyable
BLACK PANTHER,12 May 2018,1/10,Worst Marvel movie to date. Such a shame that the director and writers have completely ruined Black panthers shot at the big screen. Read the comics they are a lot better than this rubbish. Story is boring. The director has failed. The only people giving this 10/10 are SJWs who only watched the movie because it is about a black superhero but are not Marvel fans.
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"There is a lot of bial and hate in these reviews. Some or more of it seems racially or politically motivated. Others are either being movie snobs or just being contrarian. You don't have to think it's the greatest superhero movie ever (which it isn't) or the best Marvel movie (for me, it's not), but this was an excellent movie. For those who say the acting was wooden, what are you comparing this movie to? ""There Will Ne Blood""? ""The Godfather""? This is an action movie. Characters are meant to represent archetypes. There is not enough time to flesh out every character on this scale. T'Challa and Erik Killmore were the main characters. Their struggles were the core of the movie. This is not Game of Thrones, where you have 8 seasons to give depth to 15-20 characters. Compare the acting in this movie compared to the latest Transformers (or any of them really) or the latest Pirates of the Caribbean, and it's no even funny how superior this movie is to those. If you the no the acting in this movie is bad I question if you know what quality acting is, beyond what hip culture tells you (I know the type, I use to be a part of that culture)Those who attack the plot, it's a comic book movie. It's an excellent one, but one none the less. Still, it was ambitious in its scope. It was faithful to its heritage and shows black characters beyond typical movie tropes. Black characters are in Black Panther were superheroes, scientist, warriors, and a villain who was relatable. You shouldn't have to be black to appreciate this (I'm not). To the rest of you, you clearly have problems with this movie that more racially and politically motivated. Is the idea of a movie that portrays a world that has been unfair to people of African dissent so offensive? Where the points of view of some of the characters wrong? No. If it offends you politically, that's your problem. Open your mind and look at the world for what it is. If you can't see the world from others' point of view, then you are the problem, not the movie. Just shut up and let others enjoy the movie. Ultimately the movie had a positive, inclusive message. It was innovative and superbly directed (Coogler is on a roll). Haters go away."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,A movie like no other- a must watch from all perspectives!
BLACK PANTHER,14 May 2018,7/10,"I think this movie is like super hero movies in general. But the story is interesting. hannya just less satisfactory for the last battle, too fast and less so exciting."
BLACK PANTHER,8 May 2018,10/10,"I can only surmise that most of the negative ratings are from racist group targeting the film, why else would the majority come all at one time after so many positive reviews. I'm ready for another Black Panther. This movie was one of the best I've seen lately."
BLACK PANTHER,16 June 2018,1/10,"By far the worst marvel movie, and that's saying something."
BLACK PANTHER,15 May 2018,8/10,"I can see why the reviewers rate this movie low
Mostly because of the whole hype around, when you go to see the movie, you keep your expectations very high, and you end up being disappointed.(Happens in almost every movie)
I've most people complain about how predictable it was, but I tell you there is hardly any movie that you can't predict outcomes of certain situations.
Also on the acting, heard most people complain of the acting, that's basically caused by the accent (which I do like by the way)
Finally for the fighting scenes, the CGI was quite poor .
Overall, it's a great movie I think, would've gotten better rating if not for the hype."
BLACK PANTHER,16 May 2018,1/10,"This movie is proving that targeted audience is already brainwashed by advertisement and has no standards. Product placement. Mediocre acting. Overrated special effects. Can you imagine this move made by Christopher Nolan?
I can. And i wipe a tear for this. So much potential, wasted. IMDB ratings now are obviously false."
BLACK PANTHER,18 May 2018,6/10,"The camera angles in this movie were pretty good, just like any other action super hero movie. The camera was always moving either upside down of side to side. They did a lot of shots from above and camera moving with tho movement of cars and people. It wasn't very entertaining I feel like this film was an over hyped movie and it got my hopes up, but for people who love super hero movies they will love it no matter what. A lot of the fighting scenes were a little too slow and the plot wasn't very well written. But it does teach us that even our family members can be bad and you should still love them no matter what and you should share what you have to people in need. The character Michael B. Jordan played was a practical villain and obviously was doing what he did because of what Wakandas leader did to his father."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,6/10,"SPOILER: The movie is structured like any other Marvel movie, but doesn't tie in very well with the Marvel universe. The movie focuses to great lengths on the internal politics of Wakanda and became almost unbearably tedious and dialogue heavy during all the scenes that were located there.The greatest character of the movie was the main villain of the first half of the movie, which they killed off with little suspense wayyy too early. The music score was a redeeming factor, but couldn't carry uninspired CGI combat in the later half of the movie.My advice to anyone who wants to watch this movie is to wait till Andy Serkis dies, then turn the screen off."
BLACK PANTHER,19 May 2018,1/10,"I am deeply sorry but we could not watch ( 2 people) more than 15 minutes of this movie. Awful acting , dialog, settings, everything. There must be something bizarre going on with IMDb and Rotten Tomato's reviews."
BLACK PANTHER,21 May 2018,5/10,"I think this movie is greatly overhyped 
40mins into the film i could already tell what was gonna happen 
there was no type of suspense just a plain superhero movie 
great actors great movie 
too overhyped"
BLACK PANTHER,22 May 2018,4/10,"The movie wasn't that bad but I feel people are way to caught up in the racial significance of the movie. The story line took too long to develop, the villain was lame and I mean seriously lame but the soundtrack was really good, didn't live up to the hype but it was still amazing. I must say the final scene where Kill-monger stats talking about slavery was in my eyes over dramatised and over looked today's problems. I also thought that the fight scenes were underwhelming considering that it's black panther. I was also really lost in when they started calling Kill-monger kill-monger as apposed to his characters name (which I can't remember), it didn't make sense to me and it was very forced, I feel they would have benefited more if there was no alias name. Unfortunately when I left the cinema I had a sour taste in my mouth, not because it was a bad movie but because it didn't live up to the huge hype surrounding it's release."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,2/10,"Definitely does not meet the hype. The movie tries too hard. It's a combination of star wars, game of thrones, x-men, and national geographic. It's too much. Not to mention that they make racial comments that don't fit the situations. I want my money back."
BLACK PANTHER,26 May 2018,4/10,"This movie has one of the most rushed plots of any Marvel movie, which may be due to the studio drawing all of the time and money they had to Infinity War. They should have spent more time on it, and if they had it would have been more enjoyable."
BLACK PANTHER,28 May 2018,10/10,This movie is one of a kind. I don't understand how anyone could rate this movie a 1 or a 2. They're just haters.
BLACK PANTHER,6 February 2019,6/10,"This was the most mediocre film of last year it wasn't deserving of a single Oscar nomination but seven, this is political correctness gone mad. I have nothing against black people but i find it hard to believe that this film was nominated because it was good. i believe that it was politically motivated, KEEP POLITICS OUT OF NON POLITICAL MOVIES!!!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,3/10,"Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped movies I have ever seen. Most people have completely forgotten about this movie only a few months after its release in February due to its simplistic story, characters, and terrible presentation. People who still believe that this film has a deep political message are not to be taken seriously in regards to their opinions on movies.The cinematography in Black Panther is very basic with no unique style. The characters are extremely bland and although their motivations are easy to understand, they are never fleshed out enough for the audience to become emotionally invested and attached to them. Chadwick Boseman delivers a very average performance and Michael B. Jordan is easily the weakest actor in the film. The supporting cast is completely forgettable and this only becomes more apparent when we spend 20 minutes with them when the audience is supposed to believe that T'Challa is dead. I honestly can't understand why the people who wrote the script decided to include this in the film. Who do they think they are fooling? Anyone with a brain knows he's alive especially because Black Panther was in the Infinity War trailer that was released before his solo movie was in theaters. 
 
Before my first viewing of the film I was told by people who had seen the movie that Michael B. Jordan's character (Killmonger) rivals Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). Not only is this an insult to what I personally consider to be the greatest cinematic performance of all time, but is the second worst performance I have ever seen form Jordan (First being his terrible portrayal of The Human Torch in the latest Fantastic Four film). I often find myself comparing the action in this film to the action in Man of Steel (2013), completely tension less and confusing. The special effects are poor despite the film having a budget of 200 million dollars and the humor is terrible. The only thing I can truly give the movie credit for is the coloring. I'm glad that Marvel movies have bee adapting more color into their films in order to make the movie more visually appealing. Overall, this is one of the most forgettable movies in the Marvel cinematic universe and I can't say I recommend it."
BLACK PANTHER,2 June 2018,10/10,"Have you guys seen how many people voted 10/10 for this overrated movie? 57,500 people and still rising. I'm sorry but really? Didn't you guys see the last fight between T'Challa and Erik Killmonger? What kind of CGI was that? Well, maybe you were sleeping by that time. 'cause why not, the story was completely boring, predictable, and cliched. There wasn't any plot whatsoever. The characters were so shallow and undeveloped that you can't even care for any of them. People die and you don't even care. And of course, let's not forget the ''acting'' This movie harbors the cringiest actors in the universe. Their accent was killing everything. Probably you guys won't believe it but I was giggling while some dramatic scene was going on. It was just bad."
BLACK PANTHER,3 June 2018,1/10,"I'm typically a Marvel fan regardless however when this movie hit theaters I was skeptical so I waited for it to hit blu ray, after all the rave about it I rented it and wow how disappointing this movie was. A let down to say the least and the worst Marvel movie I've seen to date. I can't believe the hype and the rating this movie received, unfortunately I kept watching to see if it would get any better and sadly no, it was a complete waste of my time. Not to mention they say Wakanda 293 times in the first hour, save yourself the disappointment and do not bother wasting 2 hours of your time on this garbage Marvel film."
BLACK PANTHER,6 June 2018,6/10,"Full disclosure, I am from South Africa. And yes, I am white. Although that should not be a problem in this day and age, and if it is for you then please slink back into the stone age hole you crawled out of.Before watching this movie I was really excited. Everyone was singing this movie's praises to high heaven and back on all critic sites. So of course I watched it, not just because of the glowing reviews, but because I follow the MCU as well.Unfortunately this movie is not the paragon of all super hero movies that most positive reviews say it is. There are seriously way more better Marvel movies out there that has released in the last few years. The action was boring, the acting was okay, and the fact that the side characters and main villain was more interesting than the main character doesn't bother me at all, heck, that's what Batman is famous for as well after all. I did like the futuristic African warrior style tech in the movie though.But I am not going to slam this movie like every man/woman child on the web by giving it a 1-3/10 either. Ratings like that should be reserved for crap like the 50 shades and Twilight films in all honesty, as this movie is not as terrible as the nay-sayers are claiming it to be and voting it low due to a knee-jerk reaction for buying into the hype train. It doesn't deserve that as all.Now as for the bloody critic reviews: critics must have been afraid to score this movie low or was paid or scared to justify their scores to vote what most people are claiming to be the first ""black super hero movie"". First of, you're an idiot for thinking that. Did everyone just forget Steel was a thing? You know, with Shaq? In 1997? Guess what? It sucked. And it was panned. And nothing happened. How about that? No wonder people forgot it then hey? But then again a poor Irish reviewer did pan it and was barraged by an onslaught of angry SJWs about it, thus weeding out constructive criticism for smart people who want to see both sides to a coin, and hence people fall for the hype. And secondly, people saying it's pushing an anti-white agenda: you are the reason we as a human race cannot move forward and everything wrong with humanity.TL:DR I enjoyed the movie, but the experience was slightly marred by these people giving it 10/10 and making it out to be better than all Marvel movies, so my expectations were astronomical, and unfortunately, those expectations weren't met."
BLACK PANTHER,7 June 2018,3/10,"Well I have always enjoyed the Marvel movies, until now. This movie is dull. The effects are pretty good, but that's what the 3 stars are for."
BLACK PANTHER,8 June 2018,1/10,"This is a very basic childs film. Some nice colours and cool costumes. Odd story line, mediocre acting, but honestly not much substance. I was excited to watch it but found my self more confused than anything. Call me crazy but I feel there is some sort of conspiracy to over rate this movie. Its the worst movie of 2018 in my books. I must be losing my mind and completely out of touch with reality."
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2018,2/10,"In today's PC world of 'you can't be racist if you're black' mentality, it gives the green light to shows such as Black Panther-- Marvel's way of 'gifting' the world a picture to make all other races feel an undeserved guilt and to defend themselves from being accused as racist themselves.
Every scene had a white-bashing, anti-American narrative for a country that clearly explains how it's OK to exist in a virtual utopia, while letting the rest of Africa be eaten by parasitic worms, die of malnutrition and spread AIDS like wildfire.
The accents were way over the top. Have any of the producers or actors had linguistic coaches involved? At one point, you'd think that some of them were from Jamaica.
The story falls apart almost from the very beginning. A society that had such advanced technology wouldn't obsessively embrace living like they were still in the stone age. 
Sigh. 
If I had to speak of any positives in this film, it would be the visual effects were quite good-- except for the CGI fights involving Black Panther as they broke the laws of physics in every scene. I don't care how good your armor is-- if you get flung against a concrete wall at 100mph, your insides would turn to a fruit smoothie.
A big stinking D- for this movie! How people raved about it, I can only guess-- either they were fully shamed into hating their whiteness or loathed the fact that they were born under an American flag, I have no idea. Did Louis Farrakhan or Al write the screenplay? All this movie did was stoke racist emotions under a thin story that you could fully guess within the first 10 minutes of watching the introductions of the characters."
BLACK PANTHER,9 June 2018,1/10,"This movie is absolutely terrible. I wish I could have given it 0 stars. cant imagine any reason why anyone would give this pathetic excuse for a movie a higher rating then 5 stars. 
I just seems like everyone jumped on the black panther band wagon and gave it an automatic pass.
Thor dark world was a better movie than this and that says alot."
BLACK PANTHER,10 June 2018,8/10,"I'd heard this movie was good and finally got around to watching it. When it was done I looked on IMDB and saw hundreds of 1 and 2 star reviews that I can only fathom were written by people who would hate anything with an almost entirely black cast that focused on a fictional or real African culture, or dislike seeing empowered women characters. Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming. It's a good contribution to the overarching MCU storyline. Worth watching."
BLACK PANTHER,11 June 2018,2/10,"I like the character Black Panther, he has an awsome array of abilities and a decent backstory. Unfortunately this movie was more concerned with something else, other than presenting us with a Marvel movie worthy of the Black Panther. 
The origin story could have been handled a lot better, or was there an attempt at an origin at all?
I wanted to like this movie, but i just couldnt with all the nonsense."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2018,1/10,"Really wanted to enjoy this film as I tend to enjoy Marvel films as a bit of escapism. However they have become more and more political, and this one is just too much. The acting is terrible, especially the accents. Didn't laugh once at any of the forced jokes. The political commentary side wasn't even based on facts, just popular 'racism' myths. Avoid, not even worth renting."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2018,2/10,After hearing good things about this movie i paid to see it. From the outset i thought this may be good but as the movie went on i must say i got bored to the point i wanted it to end. The whole film was overshadowed by the black people oppressed political message being rammed at you from every angle every few minutes this is not me being racist by the way its pointing out the overuse of the message throughout the film which makes you think just bore off. The female characters overahadowed the males all the way through the movie which made the star of the film not the star. I was left feeling dissapointed by the whole thing especially the appualing soundtrack. If i could rate it with less stars i would but danai guarira and martin freeman earned these 2 stars. The fight scenes were lame no funny moments well at least if there were jokes the whole seriousness of the movie hid them well. Was not very entertained at all. Marvel need to buck up there ideas a bit as this was a flop. The fact that most of the cast were black meant nothing to me the only issue i had with this was the rubbish accents from most. The only aaving grace was the rhinos how cool were they ? All in all craptain america with a black cast. BORING AS SIN. please stan lee sort it out.
BLACK PANTHER,13 June 2018,1/10,"Saw this movie on the plane, can not believe how overrated this movie is.
It is totally flat with no real character developments. I would never gonna finish watching this if I am not on a plane with no other things to do."
BLACK PANTHER,13 June 2018,10/10,"I have seen a lot of negative reviews on here about this movie being ""over-hyped"". I would like to try and explain, to what I assume is majority white male reviewers, why this movie was so successful.To start with the negatives: Yes, there were a few cringey, stereotypical, MCU moments but these are found in all superhero movies and are part of the reason we (well, I) love them. Now... as to why this movie is an absolutely brilliant piece of film.Ryan Coogler directed this movie brilliantly. From simple things like the choice of camera angles to the comedic timing to the final scene with T'Challa and Kilmonger, the breathtaking scenes, stunning landscapes and well shot scenes created an easy-to-watch, fluid, well-conducted movie. I have seen many comments about the acting being ""boring"". Personally, I wasn't bored at all during the movie and I will explain more later but for now, the acting. Chadwick Boseman portrays a serious, somewhat brooding king who carries the weight of a nation on his shoulders. I found his portrayal a nod to many great African leaders who have shown power through outward tranquility, despite inner turmoil. He is patient, thoughtful and an intellectual yet he can still beat the crap out of anyone. 
Danai Gurira represents female, African power and is an amazing supporting actress. I don't think that many people understand the importance of the scene where her husband bows down to her. It's so empowering to see that, especially since Okoye is a true African Warrior. 
Letitia Wright's performance as Shuri was shockingly wonderful. Her comedic relief - a key trait of the MCU - was readily welcome. Seeing a super genius, who is a woman, and possibly smarter than Tony Stark is amazing. I cannot get started on Killmonger without feeling a million feelings and wanted to scream and burst into tears at the same time. I think that many people missed the point of the 3D nature of this villain. Superhero movies are generally not made to make you philosophise or think deeply about life. However, thanks to Killmonger, a whole new vision and way of thinking is introduced into the Wakandan world. Killmonger, in the movie, represents the idea of empowering other black people around the world using Wakandan technology. Although, T'Challa's father used to insist on protecting Wakanda from outsiders and keeping it a secret. Even though Killmonger is the ""bad guy"", he influences T'Challa's final decision to share Wakandan technology with the world. If you miss the significance of this then it is probably because you don't live in Africa or anywhere that has been oppressed by colonial powers. Killmonger represents the feelings, the emotions, the hate, the turmoil that Africans feel towards colonial rule, white supremacy and the oppression that they are subjected to every single day. At the end, we can't hate Killmonger because what he is saying is true. T'Challa even says that he doesn't need to die. This scene... between T'Challa and Killmonger is something that incites such strong feelings of power and insight that I can't believe people have completely ignored it. Killmonger says ""Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage..."" 
Killmonger refuses to be enslaved in a world where he is constantly oppressed because of the colour of his skin, where he comes from and his violent ideas due to this oppression. It is something that I am sure many African Americans can relate to and something that I, as an African relate to deeply. Besides the plot line, many other things made this film significant for me. It wasn't just a ""let's throw a couple of black people together and call it diversity!"" type of movie. The entire cast and crew put in SO much effort to create an inclusive movie. Most people won't notice how deeepppp they went to create this movie because they aren't African. Now, I'm from South Africa and there was A LOT of focus on South African culture. I also noticed some Ghananian and Nigerian culture creeping in but, of course, I couldn't pick up on all of it because I don't come from these countries. Firstly, the fact that they spoke Xhosa many times throughout the movie was astounding. Xhosa is not a very easy language for non-home language speakers. Although it was not 100%... only South Africans would have picked up on that. But also, there were many, many, many jokes which only South Africans would have understood/laughed at. I think that this is great because the cinema is lively and bubbling whilst watching the film, due to excitement at great jokes and the adorable nods to SA culture. The music was great. I could hear Ngobisiqolo playing in the background of one of the scenes... also Babes Wodumo and I was jamming in the cinema. It is great how they included actual African cultures and traditions to create a true African Wakanda rather than a fully Afro-American version. I throughly enjoyed the movie due to its strong themes of overcoming racial issues, fighting the powers that be and its dutiful nods to African culture. Many white men will not understand its significance but I thought that, surely, they will understand the plot line and the amazing creation of Killmonger who is probably one of my favourite villains in the MCU. A true villain is a human inside. They make you love them and hate them. They make you sad when they die. Killmonger did all these things. It really was, in many ways, a story of empowering black people - African or American -, empowering women and exposing people to the philosophy of the anger and hate that exists within Africans against colonisers and in favour of the brotherhood. I urge you to watch the movie again and look for plot lines that move you because there were so many symbols, themes and ideas that I left out in this review that I found in Black Panther. A brilliant movie, perfectly crafted for the African."
BLACK PANTHER,15 June 2018,2/10,"Weak story. 
HORRIBLE accent. 
Hollywood is able to make any living being speak in English, so why the hell use this accent that gets on your nerve.
I consider this the weakest MCU movie."
BLACK PANTHER,12 March 2019,1/10,"Ffffffffffffffffff.....fffffffffffffff
Ffffffffffffffffff.....fffffffffffffff"
BLACK PANTHER,24 April 2020,1/10,"Before I saw this movie I did not have any expectations at all in which Im glad for but the finish product still fails to impress me in any aspect. The only good part about this movie is the fact that white people can feel less racist and black people more represented in cinema. It still makes me sad that this movie won several oscars, 6 of them and that the favourite got snubbed of an oscar. I cannot accuratly express how much i dislike this movie so i finish this review by saying: Do not watch it."
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2018,10/10,Good characters with good development. It's nice to see the black panther character fleshed out. Also really cool to see strong female characters. Good actors all around. I didn't get to see in theaters by I'm happy to watch it now:
BLACK PANTHER,24 June 2018,5/10,"THe story line is same old: Wankanda, some fantasy land in outer space that is technologically advanced than earthlings. Some son of the Wakanda soldier who was left on earth and later grew up to take revenge for his father. Somehow he arrived at Wakanda and overtook as king. Then both sides started some mini war to defeat this king from Earth that was full of hatred and anger. Need more explanation of how that precious metal stolen would bring that revenger to Wakanda easily. How many times have we seen such story?They've made nice CG effects and settings of this Wakanda. Sounds and music were average. Most of the actors were not much more than reading the script without providing more personalized emotions to fit into scenarios. So they were like same as the others. The fighting actions were weak. Not asking to see skillful Kung fu moves, but at least fight with force and speed. Hits were like half of both. Only couple of the women soldiers showed some good combat moves. Overall the story is missing many parts: more better acting, character development for villains and that culture, more realistic actions other than CG."
BLACK PANTHER,28 June 2018,1/10,One of the the worst marvel films I have seen how it got any sort of award is beyond me it was slow a rubbish storyline bad acting I would recommend destroying this film it was that bad
BLACK PANTHER,29 June 2018,1/10,"Not worth the money spend. weak acting, weak cgi, weak plot and overall a weak movie."
BLACK PANTHER,1 July 2018,5/10,"This movie was supposed to be centered around Black Panther, T'Challa, and make him seem like another important member of the Avengers. Obviously, Marvel Studios strayed away from the comic book version of this hero as well and made T'Challa extremely boring and not as intelligent and capable as his publication counterpart. Throughout the movie, he gains no character development to show that he's a worthy character. This makes things worse as he already doesn't have his trademark intelligence in the MCU version. Instead, his sister, who is hardly a major component in the comics, become the smart person T'Challa was supposed to be. Killmonger was another stereotypical villain just like a lot of other villains in other movies, where he masks his emotions by saying he wants to do something good. Like he obviously doesn't care about the stuff Wakanda does with the public more than his feelings about his own life that was messed up due to losing his dad and living in a awful setting. It's kind of how Thanos acts like he's being merciful by killing half the population due to ""resource limits"" when in reality he wants to please Death by killing and not supplying the universe with resources like any sensible person would. Also like how Aldrich Killian had his feelings hurt and that's why he wanted to do all that in Iron Man 3.Also when you saw the other gold suit in the movie, you someone was going to steal it and use it against T'Challa. Classic."
BLACK PANTHER,3 July 2018,1/10,"Did not enjoy this movie. It felt like it moved so slow. CGI was garbage, and it could not keep my interest at all. I feel like they did not do Black Panther justice."
BLACK PANTHER,4 July 2018,5/10,"I would like to iterate that I am a massive MCU and Black Panther fan, so when I saw the first trailer I was fairly hyped for this film, though not overly so because I've learned not to overhype films because of experiences like Jupiter Ascending. As more trailers went on I began to become less and less excited for the movie, so much so that I didn't even see it in theatres, it simply failed to capture my interest.Having watched the film now, I can no confirm that my assumption was correct; this was a prodigiously dull Marvel film, moreso than Thor: The Dark World, and I actually liked that movie more than this.There were some aspect of the picture that I enjoyed, so I shall get that out of the way first. Andy Serkis as Klaue was a blast to watch, he was the most entertaining and had the most energy when performing, though in hindsight his role was ultimately pointless, as he is killed off very early on in the movie (though that did take a long time, the movie is exceptionally lengthy).
I enjoyed Martin Freeman as the CIA agent, his American accent was prettu believable and his acting was quite good. Some of the CGI was masterfully crafted, I especially enjoyed the backdrop of Wakanda itself, particularly the sand hologram things that the characters used to survey the landscape and communicate.
I generally enjoyed the first half more than the second half, the CGI was better in that section and the action scenes had considerably more energy to them (though I did dislike the car chase scene in Seoul).Chadwick Boseman was passable in the film, I liked him more in Civil War than here, he's very weak, despite having been given extreme upgrades in terms of his weaponry and armor, perhaps he got to arrogant and slacked off? He somehow gets beaten by a man whose only combat training is American Armed forces training, as opposed to Black Panther, who is rigourously trained in African hand to hand combat. There should be no true reason that he lost to Killmonger at any point in the movie, save for the climax when Killmonger obtains a suit of his own.As the for the cons, they are very numerous and very glaring.
First off, the accents are grating. I understand that they are nescessary to establish the world in which the film takes place, but the actors' accents start out mildly offputting to earbleedingly annoying, particularly Forest Whitaker, who sounds like the most stereotypical African man possible (which I hate to say, because I love Forest Whitaker). Aside from Klaue and Martin Freeman, all the other character are devoid of any sort of trait that is likable or even warrant of any remembrance. Black Panther himself goes through the typical hero tropes, where he starts out winning, loses, discovers something terrible about his own family, and suffers through a painfully obvious fake death sequence. Okoye, BP's second-in-command is your standard stern warrior who manages to get through every combat sequence unscathed, despite using a spear. Granted she was against henchmen who mistook their handguns for blugeoning weapons, but the point still stands. Lupita N'yongo, who I normally adore, was forgettable, so much so that I only vaguely remember her connection to BP. BP's genius, Q-esque sister who makes all his gear was especially annoying, she had a few funny lines, but everytime she came into the camera I began dreading what annoying thing she would do or say next.However, all these gripes pale in comparison to my least favorite character, that being Erik Killmonger, our supposed tragic villain of the story. I can understand that losing his father was traumatic, but his motivation is meant to paint him as some sort of tragic antihero who is doing the wrong things for the right reasons. I can say this, the film certainly did do a good job at making me hate the villain, as he was essentially advocating an African Ethnostate, which makes him incredibly irredeemable in my eyes. I normally find Michael B. Jordan to be an exceptional actor, but I found his to be, at worst boring, and at worst astonishingly painful to watch, particularly when he is supposed to be angry (it ends up being hilarious, but not in a good way). I found his final monologue before his well deserved death to be patronizing and preachy to the point of being incredibly vapid and self serving. It's almost as if you could see the director sitting in the background giving himself a big ol' pat on the back for something that doesn't need to be said and is fairly obvious to any decent human being.Overall, Black Panther was even more of a disappointment than I thought it would be, I already had a feeling that it was going to be overhyped, but I was unpleasantly shocked by what I was given. I didn't hate this movie outright, there were parts that I enjoyed, but the pros are far outweighed by the cons, which are just far too important and integral to enjoyment of this movie that it renders any good things about the movie negligable. I admire the filmmakers intentions, and I understand that no movie is easy to make and there is effort put into the film, which I suppose makes its failures all the more disappointing. The plot was like a minefield of clich√©s, which the writers a suicidal man with a metal detector doing everything in his power to step on every single one. The acting was a mixed bag and the CGI was good at first, but debilitated into a cartoon by the end (the final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was especially abysmal and campy).In the end, all I can say is that if you like the movie, good on you, I admire your ability to find joy in something that I cannot. If you disliked the movie, I hope that some of my criticisms struck a chord with you."
BLACK PANTHER,6 July 2018,1/10,I find it so ironic that a film based in Africa is mostly filmed in South Korea. This movie is a pos and unnecessary
BLACK PANTHER,29 June 2019,1/10,I don't understand the positive reviews this was the worst marvel movie ever created. This movie has high ratings just because of race.
BLACK PANTHER,9 July 2018,8/10,"What make's a great movie? The elements which bought together a super hero movie, was great script, character, acting, and performance.The purists who say that this is overrated and over-hyped is probably not willing to conquer change, as they believe in supremacy of one's characters brought upon this itself.I would rate this way higher than any Captain America, or Hulk, or any other Marvel movie, is because the story even through predictable, brings a black super hero to the table, with unique, much better, far supreme versions ever they wanted to ever be!"
BLACK PANTHER,10 July 2018,10/10,"Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen and I've Seen Plenty!!! Great Story Line! Great Acting! Great, Great Message - Especially at the End! All The Haters Please Stop Hating and Give The Movie Some Love!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peace, Love, and Happiness!!"
BLACK PANTHER,12 July 2018,1/10,"What a hugely disappointing movie. The script was juvenile and the acting was at times ridiculous. 
What a waste of time."
BLACK PANTHER,17 July 2018,1/10,"I wouldn't suggest it even to my enemy. No point watching this one, everything is boring."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2019,9/10,Black panther was a lovely movie to me.. Michael b Jordan was hot.. but how did they get those little bumps on him??..
BLACK PANTHER,12 February 2019,1/10,"After being nominated for multiple Oscar awards I was super excited to see Black Panther, only to find myself cringing throughout large parts of the movie. Terrible storyline that is very slow-paced, full of clich√©s, too little character development, hardly any funny moments. Very disappointing despite a stellar cast."
BLACK PANTHER,30 July 2018,1/10,"Filme muito fraco, n√£o vale a apena de forma alguma"
BLACK PANTHER,5 August 2018,1/10,"No story at all , just non sense action, boring plot and characters."
BLACK PANTHER,8 August 2018,7/10,"A little late of a review, but the overall movie was fairly good. I personally liked some of the cultural aspects to make Wakanda feel more realistic and unique. Some parts were a little off (designating a set ""Challenge day"" to fight T'Challa but Killmonger being able to magiczlly override that due to story progression being one), but not to the point of being distracting from the overall plot. No real complaints other than the overwhelming lack of effort put into the CGI. The rhinos were somewhat understandable, but the digital Velociraptors from Jurassic Park (yes, Park. Not World, Park.) looked more beileveable than pretty much the whole final duel between the two Panthers. In some areas (The first challenge for the throne comes to mind), the background looked so incredibly cheesy as if they didnt even try to hide the fact it was greenscreen. Other than the lacking visuals this is still a fairly good movie."
BLACK PANTHER,7 May 2018,4/10,"I watched the movie and i think it's not enough to bring african cast and story that running in Africa to have a great comics movie, the acting is very bad, special effect not good at all, i think marvel want to bring black superhero to get more fans and extra money....there are a lot of better marvel superhero ...."
BLACK PANTHER,25 January 2019,1/10,"But sadly, the political correctness that's been going on really made it miserable. It is a cliche, shallow super hero movie at best. It does''t bother me as eating some popcorn and spending some relaxed time in front of it. However, it is miles away from being called an excellent movie.
Now these cowards at Hollywood are going to put it onto the pedestal of ""Oscar"". What an insult to all the other great movies and the ones who made them. The thing is, many viewers know it, the actors and actresses themselves know it, the judges know it, the producers know it - remember ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" by Hans Christian Andersen Yup, that's exactly what's going on.
This whole clown show will be remembered as a stigma. Someone will regret it."
BLACK PANTHER,20 July 2019,3/10,"I really have a big question about this movie.Is Africa a country? Do Africans share same culture even if they are from different countries and might hate each other in the history?Definately no.But Killmonger, who grew up in the US, seemed not understand that and not really respect African diversity and Wakanda culture. Himself may suffer from discrimination in the US. But there is no reason for him to ask Wakanda people to fight for all of African. He just supposed that Africa is one entity.It's wired.Will Amercians fight for Candians/British or share their tech just because they are all white people? All live in the same continent? Or share the same ancestor?Will Japanese people fight for Koreans and forget the war history between them? Will Vietnamese save China during crisis? These are all asian countries. Maybe Hollywood is too arrogant to distinguish them, but these cultures are quite different. They will never stand together only because of skin color or they are asians.Killmonger just ignore this huge difference and so did Marvel. The film just depicted a Hollywood Africa again. People live in love and peace. People will help strangers only because their skin color. (Since Wakanda is so developed, it seems impossible to catch them as slaves. So they really have no reason to help other African people other than color.)When you make a film of other culture and did not really think about about it, you get Black Panther. This movie does not really respect African countries.Disappointing. I hope Marvel would show some real diversity."
BLACK PANTHER,23 August 2018,8/10,"People are generally too hard on this movie (or too excited about it). 
It's obviously adapted to a somewhat younger audience (so you can bring your 11-year old). Violence, yes, but not too much detail, almost no blood at all, and no sex. 
The weakness of it is that in its attempt to be empowering (and it really tries to be that) it gets too self-aware and looses tempo. It's a bit like a slightly uneven The Two Towers, set in Africa. 
I found it slow and a bit tame in the beginning, much like a Hallmark production, but halfway it picked up speed and I was drawn into the story. 
 Much of the best acting comes from the female actors, especially Danai Gurira, though I do think they could have developed some of the characters more. Michael B Jordan is hypnotizing as a tormented super villain (and not just because of his looks). But can anyone tell me what in the world Bilbo was doing there!? You're not fooling anyone with that accent btw. Can someone show him back to the Shire, please! (Though the idea to let an outsider experience Wakanda from the inside is appealing.)Hoping for a sequel!"
BLACK PANTHER,27 August 2018,4/10,So they picked the flaming gay boss from 13 going on 30 to be the bad guy and make him look all tough??? Completely tuned out after that hahaha
BLACK PANTHER,9 May 2018,1/10,"I think that by trying to pass as ""black empowerment"" film it comes across as awfully racist and stereotypical in its attempts. And nonsense no end... How does it make sense that a ""secret"" African country, hidden for millennia, thus never colonized, uses English as lingua franca for their five tribes communications and rituals??"
BLACK PANTHER,5 September 2018,,The reason for the story was never truly revealed throughout the movie. The CGI was predictable and not impressive. The acting and accents used were poor.
BLACK PANTHER,12 September 2018,9/10,"I just watched Black Panther for the first time and it was a fun, action-packed movie with a strong storyline. The CGI was beautiful. The characters were strong and well developed. The acting was great. I really enjoyed the balance between action and developing a storyline behind some of the central characters. 
It runs long but that seems the norm in a lot of action movies these days, but I am also not sure what should have been cut either. 
If you are looking for something fun and entertaining, watch Black Panther."
BLACK PANTHER,21 September 2018,1/10,One word.... BORING! One word.... BORING! One word.... BORING!
BLACK PANTHER,18 July 2021,,"As refreshing as it was to see a majority black cast in a movie, most of the movie was just boring. Given the reviews, it's easy to assume that you're going to watch the greatest MCU film yet, and while it's objectively a good movie, it's not a great Marvel movie. The casting is perfect (RIP Chadwick Boseman), and the characters are charismatic, but the pacing of the movie is off, the VFX are incredibly lackluster, and the story is just another re-hash of Hamlet. Where the movie succeeds in diversity, it lacks in originality."
BLACK PANTHER,24 September 2018,10/10,This movie was very hyped and intense! The message was behind it was powerful and could leave a mark for a second Black Panther if possible.
BLACK PANTHER,26 September 2018,4/10,"The title says it all. I saw this movie when it came out, and just watched it again, and I feel like it is too undiverse, even if it's set in Africa. I hope Marvel does not do this again."
BLACK PANTHER,29 September 2018,5/10,"Praised for having an all black cast without having any amazing qualities of its own. This movie could have been and hour and a half if they cut out unimportant garbage like the first chase against Killmonger after he took some vibranium items. The introduction was really confusing and dumb since it wouldn't be explained until a good hour into the movie. The ""death"" of black panther was really stupid since everyone in the audience knew he was alive because we aren't walking Muppets. I'm left with alot of questions throughout the movie.
Why is Killmonger so obsessed with ""freeing"" people he doesn't have any connection with except for a melanin level?
Why didn't black panther chase Killmonger and his crew after their first heist?
Why did Killmonger burn the plants that ensured the lifeline would go on?
There is one thing I really like
And that's Michel b Jordan as Killmonger.
As much as I hate his motives, I think that is kind of intentionally as it shows you how distant he is from any sort of sense. He is however genuinely entertaining and I love most of the things that come out of mouth. If this movie cut claw out and just made the movie about Killmonger from the beginning I probably would have liked it a lot more. That's it. 
5/10 
Needs Improvement"
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,1/10,"This movie is over rated. The good guy obviously wins. (because he apparently can't die from anything) He never is faced with any real threat. No character development in the whole movie. ""The good guy is good because he has a good heart"" Solid movie if you want to make 2 hours feel like an eternity"
BLACK PANTHER,30 September 2018,10/10,"To c-myrray631: 
At the beginning of the movie no one could have predicted that N'jobu was Wakandan, he looked American. Plus, why would a Wakandan betray Wakanda? Movie gives us the answer.
Also that fall is in Wakanda in the savanna, not the mountains where the Jarbari live. Also those waters looked like they could drag someone under and I bet hitting rough water from that hight is like jumping off the Empire State and hitting the pavement. It's a miracle he survived that!
The acting was amazing, and that sunset is real in Africa. And its Killmonger not Warmonger. The action was really good and the CGI is great, so is the soundtrack. And the rhinos were cool! Who doesn't want a rhino in armor for defense?!To morrisfotograf: 
These characters have value! And you see them develop.
Also, THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT STRYROTYPE!! This is the stereotype:
Black people are unintelligent and uneducated, they can't do anything right, they rape people and do drugs and alcohol, are ghetto, live in bad places, black fathers are big, dark, and southern, and guess what?! Black Panther shows black people as smart and amazing which we are!!To dubwize: 
This movie is probably the best Marvel has made!To generationofswine: 
This IS the best movie of 2018. Lots of people agree, so deal with it.To marcximus1122:
The CGI in this movie is great! And the actors were great! This is the greatest 2018 movie!To santiagocii: 
I gave this movie a 10 star rating because of its quality and plot. Because you know what IT IS!! You are the one who needs meds!!To paul-tension-837-789381: 
Black Panther deserved the hype on this. Yes it was LITTLE overhyped but seriously its great movie! And the move is only about 3 hrs long, if you want LONG go watch a 24 hr movie!! Those actually exist!To beglemanmark: 
Did you NOT watch the movie? It said that they were keeping themselves and their technology A SECRET! Plus, it's not Wakanda's problem if Tony Stark makes a self-aware huminoid robot.To all and every single one of you 1/10 raters: I love this movie!! It deserves 10/10! The effects were great, there was humor, the characters were awesome and its a great plot! So stop being haters of Black Panther. Its a GOOD movie, with a GREAT plot, with the truth about who black people are and can be and do... TOTALY AWESOME!! So go on and get mad. Because Wakanda is truly forever!"
BLACK PANTHER,2 October 2018,1/10,"I had big expectations for Black Panther as a big fan of Black Lightning TV show, I was looking forward to this release only to be dismayed. ok"
BLACK PANTHER,4 October 2018,10/10,There is a lot of hate when it comes to African American people we put out a marvel movie casted with black folks and everyone panties is up there behinds. You telling all the super heroes were white? Well we wanna feel like we can look up to black super heroes and this is what this movie was about. It was great. The movie implies that when black folks has power and knowledge that we should spread it to others and help. Be that change for the future. I can't say 1 bad thing about this movie. When you take your white children to see this film all they see is a superhero in a panther suit fighting crime. Remember that. I hope they do something else with the black panther. Like black panther rises. How many great Batman films were there? So many and so great. I know Batman isn't Marvel but you get my point. There should be more black panther films.
BLACK PANTHER,28 March 2019,5/10,If you take away the political aspects the film itself is not better than any of the marvel movies it was okay however nothing groundbreaking
BLACK PANTHER,6 October 2018,10/10,"I want to put out there that I mainly watch movies for their sound and visual experience as I am an audiophile. I read many reviews on this movie and wanted to give this movie a try. It had great critic reviews and from the looks of the reviews on here mixed, although slightly below average reviews on here. I'm not sure why the reviews here were diminished in stars. This is an action, superhero movie with all the aspects you could want. Great theatrics, action, and plot. I hate looking at reviews for a means to decide to watch a movie, but this movie, but for some reason this movie was all over the board. From an audiophile viewpoint, it was great with the computer generated imagery and sound. From a pure movie watcher experience I loved the overall plot to the storyline. Granted I'm not a comic book person, but love the movies non the less. This movie made me want to know more about the characters the country it portrayed and their people. We could all learn a lot from this movie and the fact we're all different, but have a lot that can be learned from one another. I highly recommend watching this movie to enjoy its point of view and its great theatrical presence..."
BLACK PANTHER,18 January 2019,4/10,I watched this film all the way through only because I was invested in the story. This movie was plot garbage. Special effects were cool but seriously this movie lacked the marvel charm
BLACK PANTHER,17 October 2018,1/10,I was so excited to watch a great Marvels movie and the storyline was just so dull. I got bored watching this movie and that has never happened with any Marvel movie.
BLACK PANTHER,20 October 2018,10/10,I watched this movie with 12 other colleagues and we was completely blown away.
BLACK PANTHER,25 February 2018,9/10,"Black Panther meets expectations for a comic book movie, and exceeds expectations when it comes to supporting cast. The film showed depth in its characters at all levels. There were some moments where the CGI was difficult to watch but overall that did not hinder the story. One of the best Marvel movies to date a solid 9.5/10"
BLACK PANTHER,23 October 2018,2/10,"I gave it two stars because I like the name of the movie, the rest is utterly crap. I know why the hype was so big , but if you can't deliver rather sit back and leave it alone.I'm going to be honest here. I only watched about 40 minutes of the movie and then left. Couldn't watch anymore. Was bored out of my mind and switched over to the watch paint dry channel. Way better and lots more value for money.Well, I can say I watched a little of it, wasted 40 minutes of my life and now can move on and be a better person. If you haven't watched it, don't bother, you won't miss anything. Las time I was this bored during a movie was Titanic, but I even stuck through that snooze fest. Couldn't do it again."
BLACK PANTHER,12 June 2021,10/10,"Now i first want to start by saying that upon the release of The Black panther in 2018 I did not see it until late 2020 because I had thought that I would be another rendition of Hollywood exploiting African culture ,I was extremely wrong ,as soon as i started watching it i felt a deep connection with the film and the back story of the Blackpanther and how the country wakanda came to be ,the deeply connected characters that were presented in the film also touched me and the way African culture was respected also made me proud to be African and inspired me to search more about my ancestry as an African,this film gave me alot of pride to be African not only that but it made me respect people's cultures and backgrounds more ,today Black Panther is on my top 5 of my favourite films of all time.it is truly a masterpiece, thank you to the cast and crew."
BLACK PANTHER,1 November 2018,3/10,"I thought that the story and connecting to all Marvel movies is good, Its great to know more of T'Challa, the black panther and just a ""Average"" marvel movie, not like the others.
Thats the 4 stars, the only reason it has four stars is because it part of Marvel, true honesty, it was way over hyped, and CGI was awful, what's important in the Marvel movies is a great end fight, yet this did not have any great fights, they just ended, and were not enjoyable like the other Marvel movie Universe series.
All in all, it gives you a good look at who Black Panther is and a one watch to get the info, but terrible fight scenes, CGI the worst out of all the marvel movies, first marvel movie i was disappointed about, when people say infinity war is better, I'm baffled."
BLACK PANTHER,4 November 2018,4/10,"Massively overrated, character development is quite solid, but some of the worst special effects I've ever seen."
BLACK PANTHER,13 May 2018,9/10,"If you like Marvel super hero movies then you'll like Black Panther. It's not my favorite Marvel Movie but is definitely really good.
If you are a member of the alt-right/neo-nazi movement then obviously this movie isn't for you."
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,9/10,"Everything about Black Panther is a great movie experience that I'll never forgot.
It's colors, culture and plot development
are so, so perfect! Everyone from the hero of
the film, to the villian have deeply constructed
character and texture.The best thing is the
main antagonist of the progect-Erik Killmonger.
He is made so perfectly that it makes you to care for him and want him to win.On the
other side, Black Panther is complete character
that deserves the title ,,King of Wakanda,,, but in some way he is overshadowed by the villian.
The other side characters are very good, except
of Claw.Wacthing this movie we dive in a
other world full of new culture never seen before.We forget the real life and enter a new
fantastic place named Wakanda!!Of course it isn't perfect and it has plot holes and mistakes,
but after all that I recommend you to see one of
the best Marvel movies."
BLACK PANTHER,14 November 2018,10/10,"Wonderful movie, really entertaining sfdasd asdf asd asdfas d"
BLACK PANTHER,13 March 2018,2/10,I was very disappointed with this movie. It had some cool computer graphics but very little acting. Only one or two humorous moments. It was way over-hyped. The one white actor in the whole movie was depicted as a buffoon. Had a totally inappropriate slap at America for slavery.
BLACK PANTHER,3 March 2018,1/10,"Totally wasted my time on this movie. Before buying ticket, i only checked the box office. So many ppl watched this movie, I thought it would not be too bad. The logic is very weak in this movie, most fighting scene was dragged for too long. Scenes are not connected tight enough. Not very entertaining at all. Makeup and costume designs are not eye -catching at all. 
Boring movie"
BLACK PANTHER,22 November 2018,1/10,"I couldn't take the accents, they were just too weird at timesBad acting, really bad sometimesPlot makes no sense, just chaos and copy and paste from other action moviespredictable and just plain boring"

BLACK PANTHER,9 April 2019,10/10,I have watched this movie at least 10 times since it has come out. Definitely one of my favorite movies ever. Editing and acting was fantastic!
BLACK PANTHER,4 December 2018,10/10,"This may sound dramatic to some, or maybe a lot of people, but this isn't me being melodramatic or exaggerating my view of the movie. To me, Black Panther IS a cinematic masterpiece.I could write a whole essay on why I adore this movie and why it is marvellous. Hell, maybe I will. But this is a review, not an essay, so here goes;
why Black Panther is a 10/10 star movie and a cinematic masterpiece.First of all, the characters.
The characters of Black Panther are strong, complex, and three-dimensional. This is true for both the women and men in the story, the heroes and the main villain.The three main women in Black Panther are strong characters as individuals, especially whose purposes and characterisation within the story aren't solely related to the men in it. They have their own motivations, beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses.
Shuri. Nakia. Okoye.
Shuri is incredibly intelligent, funny, and greatly skilled in science.
Nakia is kind, compassionate, diplomatic, and forward thinking.
Okoye is immensely loyal, determined, passionate, and dedicated.
Out of all the Marvel movies so far, Black Panther has the best representation for women in my opinion by far. I found myself internally screaming in awe at how awesome they are while in the cinema, especially at their badassery and boldness.The men are also well represented, particularly T'Challa and Killmonger. They, like the women, are three-dimensional, strong, and complex. They too, feel real, as all great characters do. What is especially significant about these two, however, is the construction of them as main hero and main villain. T'Challa has the title role of the superhero Black Panther, while Killmonger is the villain. Despite being a villain, it is easy to sympathise with Killmonger, because he is a three-dimensional villain. His reasons for his behaviour are shown to us through his backstory and not only does it make the audience put ourselves in the 'villain' 's shoes and understand why he did what he did, but it did a brilliant job of demonstrating that people are complex and morally grey, that the person/character set up as a villain is only the villain from one side of the story. Killmonger himself did what he thought was right and what he was motivated to do based on his experiences. The depth and pain and heartache this added to the story and movie as a whole, as well as the characters and their relationships is what makes it significantly better than some other Marvel movies in terms of villain characterisation.Then there is the representation of African people. As someone who is not African, I cannot speak on the representation of African people in the movie. I can only speak on what I observed and know, and that is, that this movie did amazingly well at the box office. Not just because it is a Marvel movie, but because it is a diverse, almost all POC cast Marvel movie. The fact that this movie did that well at the box office, as did other diverse movies such as Crazy Rich Asians and Coco, speaks volumes to the amount that diversity in cinema is not just wanted but needed. Online, on twitter especially, I saw people of colour, specifically African people, talk about how Black Panther impacted them, how seeing themselves represented in an entire cast of a Marvel movie felt. Black Panther means a lot to a lot of people and it's impact is another reason why it's absolutely brilliant.Now, the writing of Black Panther, Holy Hera. The writing of this movie, just WOW. It is witty, clever, character driven, exciting in every scene, emotional, and packed with social commentary. A kind of social commentary that is executed so well throughout the movie that it is intertwined with other aspects of the movie. It's sprinkled into the witty dialogue, Killmonger's backstory and characterisation, the relationships between the characters, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful acting, and exciting action. The social commentary isn't a smack in the face, it's a series of questions that are directed to the audience in subtle yet clear, and bold ways.I've seen a heap of reviews on here, and other places, where people review it as ""overrated"" or ""overhyped"" but that seems a bit fishy to me. People do, of course, have the right to their own opinion and to express that opinion, however, I recommend that people who hate on Black Panther or who simply view it as ""overrated"" rewatch it. Not everyone will agree with me that it is a cinematic masterpiece, but please don't discredit it completely because of predetermined ideas about it or biases.If all I've already said about Black Panther isn't testament enough to the brilliance of this movie, it's impact, and it's worthiness of 10 stars, then perhaps this will;
Out of every Marvel movie I've seen, this is the one Marvel movie that as soon as it had finished, I immediately wanted to rewatch it."
BLACK PANTHER,7 December 2018,10/10,"This was a great film! I really enjoyed it. It has a very interesting story and very interesting characters. The film is almost perfect, the only thing that could be worked on is the CGI, just a little bit especially as the film gets closer to the end. Nevertheless I had a good time watching it. Easily one of the best Marvel movies and easily one of the best superhero movies. 10/10"
BLACK PANTHER,8 December 2018,10/10,"It was an amazing film with lots of depth, many people are giving this film 1 star just to bring it's score down which is petty"
BLACK PANTHER,24 January 2019,3/10,"This is the most generic superheroes movie, literally you can predict what happen next, if you want see a movie just to relax your brain, this is the best choice"
BLACK PANTHER,13 December 2018,10/10,"Black Panther is an action, adventure and science-fiction movie, it was released on 14 February 2018 (in France). This movie was directed by Ryan Coogler, the part of Black Panther/T'Challa (main character) is played by Chadwick Boseman and the part of Erik Killmonger (the villain) is played by Micheal B. Jordan.T'Challa is the prince of a hidden and advance kingdom: Wakanda. When his dad dead, he has to rule Wakanda.The plot of this movie match the comic in every details . Chadwick Boseman is the most talented for the part of Black Panther and Micheal B. Jordan is maleficent, when you see all the scars on the body Erik Killmonger it's spooky. The visual effects are so breathtaking ! The original sound track is the best music for a Marvel movie. The background is so beautiful; the Iguaz√∫ Waterfalls in Argentina are the greatest idea to represent the Wakanda. The actions scenes are the most fantastically but a little aggressive for me.To finish I don't want to say more, it's worth your money because the story is the most impressive, the actors are the most talented and the music is the best."
BLACK PANTHER,14 December 2018,3/10,"DISAPPOINTED AFTER ""EVERYONE"" SAID THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE. TOO CAMPY FOR ME AND PREDICTABLE - OVER ACTING BY BOSEMAN, BASSET,WHITAKER. MANY SLOW PARTS IN SCREENPLAY AND NO MENTION OF THE BIGGER MARVEL UNIVERSE IT COMES FROM. FOUND THE MOVIE SLIGHTLY PATHETIC , SORRY. WASTED OPPORTUNITY FOR A MUCH BETTER FILM THAT NEEDED A BETTER SCRIPT AND CASTING. COSTUMES, MUSIC WERE GOOD AND EVEN THE ""KNOCKED"" CGI WAS GOOD ENOUGH....GREAT WAS - DANAI GURIRA, LETITIA WRIGHT, LUPITA NYONG'O, MARTIN FREEMAN"
BLACK PANTHER,23 January 2019,1/10,Black Panther is an SJW leftist propaganda and that's reflected in the Best Picture nomination awarded at the Oscars. To think that this is the first superhero movie to get a nomination in this category proves that. In no way is it better than The Dark Knight or any movie in that trilogy. Oscar nominations need to be less of propaganda if we need to have faith in that institution.
BLACK PANTHER,30 December 2018,1/10,"Always an avid Marvels watcher but this is by far the worst I have seen. Lion King meets Marvel, very political slant. Don't bother."
BLACK PANTHER,25 January 2019,1/10,"When you go to watch this film, you go in with high expectations after T'Challa's amazing introduction in Civil War. But boy, this film disappoints you like nothing.The actors were great, they've done their job well, but I'd say, plot-wise, it is the worst MCU film after Thor : The Dark World. Yes, even the Incredible Hulk is better than this movie.The CGI is supposed to be spectacular, but they've completely bottled it. It's awful when it's expected to be great, and surprisingly beautiful in the ""calmer/peaceful"" scenesAfter Iron Man in 2008, even Even Iron Man 2 didn't fail us this badly, let alone this, where we were expecting to watch the Black Panther's true quality after glimpses of brilliance in Captain America : Civil War. The professional critics are praising it only and only for political purposes.It's a major, major blunder for Marvel Studios"
BLACK PANTHER,16 January 2019,10/10,This may be one of the most important super hero films of our time. Especially with the current climate we are in with politics & civil rights. This film was so important as well as amazing. Enjoyed every minute of it. Can't wait til part 2. Want to see what more is in store for Black Panther. Great job to all of the actors!!!!
BLACK PANTHER,30 January 2019,9/10,"Black Panther is a very well-crafted movie from Ryan Coogler, and it's a watershed moment for representation in film. Not only is it culturally significant, but it boasts strong performances, a deep story, great action, and fun characters."
BLACK PANTHER,2 February 2019,1/10,Worst movie of the Marvel series. Absolutely senseless and disappointing.
BLACK PANTHER,21 February 2018,9/10,"Another installment from the marvel comic book series: the latest installment brings to the big screen Black Panther played by Chadwick Boseman who in it plays the newly minted King T'Challa of a mythical, uncolonized Central African country named Wakanda. His ascendance to Kingship comes as the result of his father, T' Chaka, being killed in a terrorist attack by the antagonist (#1) Ulyssess Klaue who we soon find out is a South African jewel thief in pursuit of the mineral Vibranium to presumably make huge profits off of on the black market. Wakanda is rich in Vibranium that is exclusive to and the life blood of the country and has made it the most technologically advanced country in the world. The film stays true to the origin of the comic book series while managing to include bigger yet subtle overarching themes such as black cooperation or the lack thereof, moral ambiguity, and isolationism vs black global solidarity for the greater good. Ryan Coogler is able to visually shatter and debunk the real life age-old myths perpetuated by white historians that Africa was/is a continent bereft of traditions and cultural achievement comparable to that of Europe thereby justifying colonialism. From the onset we see that this is a country steeped in rich traditions, pageantry, and government structure, and more advanced than much of the western world beyond just technology. While the movie is very much present-day and futuristic, it also at the same time pays homage to the best of an Africa past that has been written about and celebrated extensively by the John Henrik Clarkes, the Walter Rodneys, and WEB Duboises and so on of the world to counter the racist stereotypes of white historians. The most compelling feature of the film for me was that this may have been the 1st time I can recall where a film of this magnitude (and enormous budget) didn't subject the beautiful black women characters to ancillary roles in relation to their male counterparts. Without having to mention it, the audience was able to see that Wakandans understood in order to have a progressive society, the women must be equally empowered as the men. All these women's characters had weight to them. Now, what I also found fascinating was the director's deviation from most comic book movies in its portrayal of the villain, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. It has been commonplace for a great deal of the comic book movies to typically establish what the villain's character arc and motives are which enables audience members to see a clear dichotomy between ""good"" vs ""evil"" but this film takes a detour from this cinematic comic book trope midway through by creating a moral dilemma that somewhat makes the villain a sympathetic character or at the very least a misunderstood antagonist (#2). This movie was a success on so many levels; if I were absolutely compelled to nitpick anything I didn't like about the movie perhaps it would be the CGI that has become a bit overused for my personal taste in big budget super hero comic book movies but that was by no means enough for me to say it interfered with my view of the film overall. The movie was 2:15 minutes but the pacing was really good with no real lulls in it; I was left wanting more and can't wait to see if Marvel/Disney/Coogler can top this."
BLACK PANTHER,8 February 2019,10/10,"It is definitely one of my favourite movies.
Good action and implementation.In addition, the movie is partly funny, which I think is very good.
What I personally think is a pity that no Marvel heroes from other films play in it so that the film is not properly networked with the other mcu films. But what I also want to add positively is that I really like the movie a lot, because it's a bit different from what you normally know about Marvel (other country / religion, a lot of technology, sister of the hero is quite important and something else)"
BLACK PANTHER,14 February 2018,10/10,"After thinking Thor: Ragnorok wasn't really worth my efforts, I was so happy with this instalment from Marvel. I hope they don't get bright and get a new director for subsequent BP films that turns it into everything i disliked in Thor as well as GOTG. I cannot fault Black Panther - it even inspired me to want to shave my head for a moment (then sense took over). It was a beautiful film. Women rock. I loved the rituals. I loved the fact it incorporated fashions from all over Africa - but Tchaka wore Ntoma from Ghana worthy of a King. At my viewing there was a round of applause.But the best bit was seeing the look of delight on my friend's daughter who was allowed to stay up post bed time to watch BP. She was captivated. To all the naysayers, if they could see the looks of amazement that girls and boys alike will have as they watch, then they may take several seats."
BLACK PANTHER,19 February 2019,10/10,"Great actors , wonderful 3D effects , amazing views and a well thought script"
BLACK PANTHER,20 February 2019,9/10,"Today in the United States and around the world minorities are often oppressed by governments and feel abandoned by groups that could've helped them overcome it. In the 2018 Academy Award nominated movie Black Panther this issue is one of several discussed in the plot. The movie follows the story of Wakanda, a fictional utopia for Africans on their native continent. While war wages on the outside all is at peace in Wakanda. The king of Wakanda is T'Challa who loves his people and wants them to prosper; he is given the powers of the Black Panther, a mythical superhero that allow him coupled with technology, to be literally unbeatable. The story of the movie weaves through the different settings and time periods to show the difference between Wakanda and the outside world, while they are prospering the world is struggling.Throughout the movie music plays a huge role in terms of conveying the meaning behind it. The tempo rhythm and beat all help to set the mood of the scene. Whenever the king T'Chaka or his side are involved traditional African drumming is prevalent to contrast when Killmonger or the antagonist side is involved more contemporary rap music takes over. This contrast helps to convey the contrast between the two sides and what they stand for, thus adding an aspect of social commentary on the debate of the non-violent traditionalists and violent realists. T'Chaka wants to keep Wakanda separate, to preserve the Utopia of the previous generations. Killibonger on the other hand wants to use the edge in technology and peace Wakanda has to overthrow the world and create an empire where ""the sun never sets."" Music also is present in combat in the form of high tempo to add intensity to the scene.Cinematography also plays a huge role in the movie too and helps to provide social commentary throughout it. A good example is when the mentioning of sunsets come up and there is a scene of Killbonger and T'Chaka where music accompanies the beautiful images and lighting. In Oakland where the movie starts lighting is dim and dark to show the state of current people of African descent. Meanwhile in the technology lab in Wakanda, the lighting is bright and futuristic showing how advanced they are. This helps to provide a commentary of the contrast between Wakanda and the outside world because with these examples the viewer can see how it relates to reality and visual aspects of the movie.Acting also plays a huge role in how the social commentary between the contrasting sides is portrayed. The casting of Chadwick Boseman in the lead role of T'Challa is perfect as he carries the role with ease of showing a caring king for his people. On a contrasting note, Michael B. Jordan plays an amazing Killmonger someone who is fed up with the world and the oppression it presents; how he is in it solely for the benefit of himself and no one else. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker play well casted supporting roles to help surround these leads with people who have similar viewpoints and wishes for Wakanda and the world. Throughout the movie, these characters add a dimension behind the two leads as they fight for power and the future.I recommend Black Panther because above all it helps to portray and tell a well structured story of how minorities struggle every single day in the world to gain recognition and equal treatment. This movie provides the social commentary of being open to help those around oneself peacefully without conflict and to build through friendship, not aggression. This especially plays out in the end, but I do not want to spoil it, so go watch Black Panther. It is available on most streaming platforms such as Netflix and on iTunes and Google Play."
BLACK PANTHER,28 February 2019,7/10,"This movie definitely isn't as perfect as it's often lauded to be. I think that it accomplished a lot on the strength of its cast and its message. There are some corny moments in the movie that kind of detract from it as a whole, but there are dozens of cool and funny moments to offset that.If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest just watching it. You won't regret the time."
