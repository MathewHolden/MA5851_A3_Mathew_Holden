JOJO RABBIT,9 April 2020,5/10,"I love Taika Waititi's work...so it's not too surprising that I'd want to see ""Jojo Rabbit""...his latest and strangest film project. His previous work, such as ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" and ""What We Do in the Shadows"", really impressed me. In light of this, it's very sad that I wasn't particularly impressed with ""Jojo""....though I must admit it was well crafted.The problem for me is that the film really ISN'T a drama nor a comedy. A few things, such as Sam Rockwell's outfit near the end of the film, simply are surreal and senseless. If you're looking for a hilarious movie, well, with all the death and Hitler in it, it's not the least bit funny. If you want a serious drama about the final months of the Third Reich, well, the film is often too light and carefree....an unusual case where the movie fails on both accounts with me. This being said, the reviews for this film are incredibly positive and you may well enjoy it....but for me, it's STILL too soon to be making Hitler-fied films like this one...especially since, unlike ""The Producers"", it really isn't funny."
JOJO RABBIT,3 September 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit tells the story of the final days of World War II through the eyes of a
child. To be specific a member of the Hitler Youth. Young 10 yar old Roman Grifin
Davies is our protagonist in this story.When the Nazis gained power the Hitler outh was one of the most insidious ways of consolidating futue power. If they hadn't started the European portion of World War II who knows how long they could have stayed with a whole generation of youth indocrinated as it was.As with youth all over the world Davies is subject to peer pressure. He's not the
most athletically inclined kid around and has a problem with the physical stuff.
He has however an imaginary friend. The Fuehrer himself played by director
Taika Waititi encourages him on. The title comes when the kid gets sqieamish
about killing a rabbit and earns Jojo Rabbit as a title of derision.But his mother Scarlett Johansson is a lot less enthusiastic about the Nazis and she's taken to hiding a Jewish teen Thomasin McKenzie. When the lad
discovers this it puts him on the horns of a dilemma.Part drama, part comedy, part satire, Jojo Rabbit has something to appeak to all tastes. Jojo Rabbit won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and was
nominated for a flock of other Oscars inclding Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Scarlett Johansson.Once viewed Jojo Rabbit is a film that will linger on."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,9/10,"It's WWII and Germany is losing the war. 10 year old Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) can't tie his own shoes and has an imaginary friend in Hitler (Taika Waititi). He is starting Hitler youth training under weary war veteran Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). He refuses to kill a rabbit and the guys ridicule him as Jojo Rabbit. One day, he finds a girl living in the wall of his late sister's room. His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).This is an inventive film. It is feel-good and heart-breaking. It has comedy and tragedy. It is an outside-the-box, brilliant film from the unusual Taika Waititi. The kid is brilliant. The best friend is funny. ScarJo is terrific. There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best."
JOJO RABBIT,1 April 2020,,"It is a precise diagnosis for present. Touching , poetic, subjective in profound sense, naive, off course.In same measure, it is well crafted satire. And a nice- bitter parable.And a challenge, scene by scene. The prize is the parallel between the performance of young Roman Griffin Davis and David Bennent in The Tin Drum or Archie Yates and Danuel Pipoly in The Lord of Flies. Short, that kind of film easy to define as useful for part of its public or boring, supperficial, violent for others. . Because it seems too much,it is heartfelt and precise and its purpoise, so obvious is just to discover, in its fundamental traits and its nuances, the near reality. So, provocative in many senses."
JOJO RABBIT,27 October 2019,8/10,"Roman Griffin Davis is looking forward to a week at Hitler Youth Camp. When he fails to demonstrate his dedication to ethnic purity and Nazi ideals by breaking the neck of a rabbit, the rest of the campers start call young Johannes -- that's Master Davis -- ""Jojo Rabbit"". He runs off, naturally, and confers with his goofy imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, who informs him of the ferocity of rabbits. So Roman runs back, where Sam Rockwell is about to give all the boys a chance to throw a grenade, grabs one, and winds up scarring his face and behind. When he gets out of the hospital, his mother, Scarlett Johansson knees Rockwell in the ... well, it's not the behind.All perfectly normal in the year 1945, as the Thousand Year Reich's ever victorious army is being shredded, with Russian, American, British, and probably Chinese armies are about to march on the town. It's when Roman discovers that his mother is hiding Thomasina McKenzie, a Jew, in the floorboards behind his dead sister's room, that things begin to get odd. She takes his knife away from him, but they eventually reach a stalemate, because if Miss Johannsson finds out he's found out, then Elsie will have to go. So instead, he begins quizzing her on her diabolical schemes to take over the world, where are the horns on her head * and so forth. It gradually begins to dawn on him that he may not have understood reality perfectly up to now, which is startling for a boy who has achieved the great age of ten and a half to realize.It's a weird movie about children being asked to grow up too fast. The only movie that feels at all like it is THE DEATH OF STALIN, and this feels way weirder to me. After all, one of my grandfathers was a communist, but everyone agreed that Hitler was the worst person ever. It was so obvious that even the goyim had figured it out, although it took them a war to reach the startling conclusion that someone who had been screaming about Jews, Slavs, Blacks and homosexuals for more than twenty years, and who had killed, oh, all of them he could manage, might not be the nicest guy in the world. It's certainly upsetting to think of him as a goofy imaginary friend.I know what you're thinking. You're thinking ""here's an American Jew who grew up in the aftermath of the Second World War, when about a third of his family had been killed in the Holocaust -- which some of you deny ever happened -- so he has issues! It's not like some one vile, like Justin Trudeau, John Wayne, or Walt Disney, was a goofy imaginary friend, which is impossible, because they were evil incarnate.""Well, we all have issues, don't we? This is one weird movie. Is it a great movie? It's a weird one.
* A question I got asked in Colorado in 1971"
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,6/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a new American 2019 movie and one of the big players this awards season. First of all, I want to say that it is quite ironic that this film came out pretty much the same time here like a film based on a famous German book about a pink rabbit, but international readers have most likely no clue what I am talking about, so I won't go any further into detail about that. Instead, let's elaborate on these slightly over 105 minutes we have here. Director Waititi is a big star in Hollywood now already obviously as he also gave us his take on the Marvel universe, but this film here is the one that means even more breakthrough for him. He is also credited as the one and only writer who adapted the novel into the screenplay. If it wasn't for Peter Jackson, you could also say that he is the biggest filmmaker from New Zealand ever already, even if he missed out on the Academy Award nomination for Best Director, but he was probably close. The only acting nomination for the Oscars went to Scarlett Johansson and it seems the Academy wants to make it up this year for her by giving her two nominations even after ignoring her for so long. This one here is also her better shot at the win, even if both are very unlikely.Lead actor Roman Griffin Davis, who plays the title character, was nominated for a Golden Globe despite his young age. I am not too mad about that. He was pretty good for sure and especially in the second half, he almost carried the film solely on his shoulders with Johansson and Waititi out of the picture. Yes, Waititi also acts in here. You can see on the poster which character he plays. I am not sure I can write the name and my review will get through. Then again, he does not really play the character, he just plays how a young boy perceives said character if he was his best friend. Sadly, while Waititi was incredibly funny and gave a great performance and also I think had he had more screen time, then he could have been nominated for a supporting Oscar too, I struggled with the way they included him. The things he said frequently felt just written and for the sake of it and not what a boy would make out of them, if he was really a figment of his imagination. This applies especially to the Churchill scene you can also see in the trailer, but also the last appearance from said character when the boy almost banned him out of his mind felt out of place. By then, clearly all his sympathies were gone, so they simply should not have had him return, even if the way he got kicked through the window was pretty epic and funny (like Tarantino blowing himself up in ""Django Unchained""). Don't get me wrong, I think the character added a great deal of entertainment and Waititi gave a really good performance, but in the overall picture it did not feel right to me beyond entertainment.The cast includes other familiar faces too: Sam Rockwell is doing fine as always and his two acts of kindness stay in the mind. He did not have too much screen time, but when he was on, he was really commanding and you can see why he is an Oscar winner now. I still think he looks way younger than he is. By the way, he was gay in this movie, wasn't he? So he had his own tragic story too that we did not find out too much about. Rebel Wilson is just in it for some funny punchlines and that is alright. She is easy to recognize in every film she is in, but great range she has not, especially not when it goes beyond comedy. But the audience in my showing clearly loved her and I can't deny Waititi wrote her as good as it gets. At the end, we find out that, unlike Rockwell's character, there is really no hope for her soul. Proud Nazi until the very end. Now I already said RDG was pretty good in the lead, but the one I liked even more was Archie Yates. I am not yet sure if it was his performance or just his material, but this kid was a riot honestly. Every scene with him was a winner and I hope I can see him in other projects soon. In general, they did a great job with the casting here. Nobody feels that they could not work the part and I also include Thomasin McKenzie with that. She gets more screen time the longer the film goes and while her story is definitely the most dramatic from all characters involved, she has lighter moments like everybody else. I just wondered why she really believed these letters came from her boyfriend and how she really knew towards the end that he was dead if she did not even know who won the war. Oh well, minor script flaws, but this one still has a shot to win an Oscar there. Script and maybe costumes are the only shots the film has really. Still more than most others. I do think the script would not be undeserving.This film peaks especially with the dialogue writing (there are so many examples, not just Waititi's character), but also those moments when the girl towards the end steps out into the light and can leave the house again without having to fear death. Or the many excellent ways in which Waititi breathed life into the clash between innocent childhood and the cruel world around them. How the boy says near the end that the Germans won and that she must stay was just one example. It had nothing to do with him being evil, just with him being afraid of losing her. Or when he attacks her with the knife and the wound is almost non-existent. All this shows he is a good boy, also because of the way he was raised. He loves his mother dearly and does not see her as an opponent (except the ""rat"" moment maybe), even if he is not happy about her not telling him about the hidden girl. We see him cry so hard when the mother is dead. There are serious moments for sure, but still I think young people can and should watch this film. So does Johansson's character early on when she shows him these people who were murdered for not supporting the Nazis. This is one from a handful scary scenes. Rockwell's final moment. How they turn poor children into soldiers... Another would be right at the very start, the scene with the rabbit, the one that gives Johannes the nickname we see in the film's title. Again this scene shows that he is not evil or cold-blooded and his only reason for being with the Nazis is that he wants to belong somewhere. He basically just repeats what he hears, the best example is all about the Jews really that he also wrote in his book. It shows that he is curious and wants to make up his mind himself when asking the girl about her kind. He does no longer want to just blindly accept what other people say.Speaking of the girl, this scene with Merchant's character (seeing him first in the trailer I thought it was Lars Eidinger) is among the most memorable from this film. Of course, it is incredibly tense and scary, but it is also over the top (in an entertaining way) and really funny near the end when we see what Jojo wrote and painted about Nathan, the girl's boyfriend. The butterfly scene from before that also stays in the mind. Or the chubby kid's words (for example ""not a good time to be a Nazi"" he was really good in making the simplest statements about really complicated aspects and they still felt real). So yes, this film definitely has far more positive to offer than negative. There were scenes and moments that did not feel too authentic and realistic to me, like some quotes by Jojo felt more from a grown-up and written than actually from a boy his age, which is maybe my biggest criticism. Or how he finds the girl I struggled a bit with. Yes he is a curious boy, but that was really too much effort if you ask me. Or the physical conflict between the two when the girl shows him her strength and that the Germans/Nazis are not really superior in terms of strength. It's not a perfect film, but one that is highly entertaining and stays very memorable too. And even with the sad aspects like Johansson's character dying, it is not a depressing film. The boy lost his mother, but remember he is not an orphan. His dad is still out there somewhere and he can probably return eventually. Or that he basically, one way or the other, has a sister again with what the two went through together that will always unite them. So it is also an uplifting film. This also has to do for sure with what Waititi had in mind about people all ages that should see the film. He certainly succeeded and he would not have, had he turned this into a super depressing political or (anti-) war movie without light moments whatsoever. Instead it is these light moments that dominate the film. Sometimes it had a touch of Wes Anderson to me.And don't be distracted by everybody speaking English here despite the film being set in Germany. This was just a decision because they did not want to cast German actors all along and I don't mind or care at all. You can still watch the German dub if that is a problem for you. For me, it was probably only something that slightly confused me for five minutes or so. Okay I guess this would be all then. I think the rating here on imdb is a bit too high and I can see why some critics did not like it too much, but I personally felt it worked really well as a satire, so no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up and a positive recommendation. It may not be among the best films of 2019, but it certainly is a good achievement and I would say instead, it is among the most different films of the year and truly a unique achievement that oozes creativity and deserves to be checked out for that reason alone. Finally, I want to add as a little closing statement that I watched the film from the perspective of somebody who has not read the book it is based on. I don't think it is necessary at all to do so in order to enjoy the movie, so I cannot talk about differences and parallels between this film and the base material, but I doubt the book is bad or anything if it results into such an interesting film. Certainly closer for me to 4 stars out of 5 (maybe on a rewatch), but for now I will just go with 3."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,5/10,"Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany. A lifetime of indoctrination has given him a hatred of Jews. He has been drafted into the Hitler Youth where he does not fit in. He is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit and bullied by the older boys.His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is raising Jojo alone. His father is missing, his sister is dead. He discovers that his mother has been hiding a teenage Jewish girl called Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic. To make his life more complicated, he has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi.)This would had been a brilliant film if the Monty Python team had made it in their prime. If Mel Brooks had made this, he would have added a song and dance number called Springtime for Hitler.Instead Taika Waititi's film left me cold. It had an air of smugness and self congratulation about how zany this movie is. Only Sam Rockwell caught the spirit of the film with his Captain Klenzendorf, a soldier who knows the war is lost. This is such an uneven film and the satire is off target too many times.Eventually Jojo and Elsa reach an understanding but at times I thought I was watching an episode of Allo Allo."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit (Roman Griffin Davis) is part of the Trump Youth Group. He is a ten-year-old boy who likes to dress up, be part of the club and play Nazi. Hitler (Taika Waititi) is his imaginary friend. As the war closes in on Berlin, he discovers a Jew (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in the closet. His mother (Scarlett Johansson) is part of the resistance.The film depicts the Germans in a comic fashion similar to ""Hogan's Heroes."" In spite of the dark background, the film is mostly light. Sam Rockwell gives us a comical performance.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2021,8/10,"I thought this was bags of fun, who said that satire was a thing of the past, Jojo Rabbit prices that it is alive and well..It's one of those films that will have you laughing one minute, crying the next, then awkwardly chuckling in the scene after that.It's very well acted, very well made, the production values are actually very, very strong.I saw this on its release with a few friends, it was my choice, faces were pulled at the thought of it, but everyone enjoyed, one quibbled before the film that she thought it was going to be offensive, it isn't, it's all tongue in cheek.I look forward to seeing it again, I recommend. 8/10."
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,10/10,"So Taika Waititi is an exceptional director and this is proof of that! I mean who'd take Hitler as an imaginary friend (source material is way more serious apparently, haven't read it) and not just run with it, no pun intended, but make a funny, engaging and heartfelt movie with it? Well the answer lies in front of you and is ready to be enjoyed.Although to be fair, there is not just enjoyment and there are quite a lot of scenes here that will make you cringe to say the least. It is not just about showing violence for what it is (explicit), but also finding a balance with the humor. There is a let's everyone say ""Heil"" that seems to go forever, but the scene as akward as it is and seems, still works.JoJo Rabbit has a few things that happen in the background or are not really talked about (see Sam Rockwell and his ... ""hidden"" love, which while obvious is never spoken out literaly) - there are so many little gems in this movie, handled with so much care and dignity, it really is amazing. I know and heard some be offended even before seeing it and never really plan to watch the movie - which is their loss I reckon, but better that way than being offended by something that is widely considered as being funny and as delicate as it can be"
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,8/10,"Well, it's not ""Schindler's List"", and it might demonstrate a bit of Monty Python inspiration, but at heart this is a biting anti-hate film that uses drama and humor effectively to tell the story of a Nazi youth and a Jewish girl about to discover the world and themselves as part of the human condition. Films like this remind us that the differences that exist among disparate ethnicities or races are almost always an accident of birth, and if left unchallenged, people can generally learn to get along with one another. Young Johannes 'JoJo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is determined to uphold the will of The Fuehrer in the form of his imaginary friend Adolf (Taika Waititi, who doubles as the film's director), and is left conflicted over the actions of his mother (Scarlett Johansson) when he learns that she's been hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a disguised passageway of their German home. Over time, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) and JoJo form a relationship that evolves into friendship, and in JoJo's case, borders on a case of puppy love, all while in the midst of Allied forces about to break the back of the Nazi stranglehold on their home town.You wouldn't think that a film dealing with Hitler would be fodder for comedy, but director Waititi manages to walk a fine line between drama and humor. There will be those viewers who vilify the picture for it's dialog and treatment of Jews, but that's one of the things that always bothers me about a movie's detractors. By showing what occurred at one time in history isn't the same thing as supporting those actions, as deplorable as they might have been. The picture finds it's balance in the caricatured treatment of Nazi villains like Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf, Gestapo leader Deertz (Stephen Merchant), and the riotous Fraulein Rahm, portrayed by Rebel Wilson. One might even conclude that Klenzendorf, as loyal as he was to the Nazi cause, had at least a spark of humanity by disavowing JoJo in the presence of American soldiers so the young boy wouldn't be considered a Nazi sympathizer.I couldn't think of a more perfect ending for the movie, reminding us of Elsa's promise to dance when she knew that the war was over and that she had finally acquired her freedom. Having survived great personal tragedy with the death of his mother and loss of a sister, JoJo looks himself in the mirror and vows that ""Today, just do what you can"". The closing soundtrack echoes JoJo's sentiments, and those of all people who are inspired to overcome their own unfortunate circumstances, as David Bowie's German lyrics relate how 'We can be heroes, just for one day'."
JOJO RABBIT,7 August 2020,10/10,"With Hitler known as the embodiment of evil, it would seem impossible to laugh at him. However, Charlie Chaplin, Mel Brooks and Quentin Tarantino all made us do so. To that number we can now add Taika Waititi thanks to ""Jojo Rabbit"", about a ten-year-old boy in Nazi Germany while the Third Reich was on its last legs. Waititi plays a loopy version of the Führer (the boy's imaginary friend).Basically, the movie poses the question of why a person would hate another person, and why anyone - especially a child - would embrace fascism (all the more relevant nowadays). An outstanding and hilarious movie.Waititi's Oscar win for the screenplay made him the first indigenous person (he's Maori) to ever win a competitive Oscar."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,7/10,"I was instantly attracted to this film the first time I saw the trailer, and I had a feeling it was going to have a Marmite reaction, audiences would either love it and go with it, or hate it, written and directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Thor: Ragnarok). Basically, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Golden Globe nominated Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany during the later stages of World War II with his mother, Rosie (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Scarlett Johansson). His father is missing in action on serving on the Italian Front and his older sister Inge recently died of influenza. Jojo, who seems very passionate about Nazism, often talks with his imaginary friend, a supportive but childish version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Jojo and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) attend a Hitler Youth training camp, run by the one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he cannot bring himself to do it, and runs off crying being taunted by the other boys, calling him ""Jojo Rabbit"". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns and throws a hand grenade without permission. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, Rosie asks Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading propaganda leaflets throughout town and collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers a teenage Jewish girl hiding upstairs, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), also his sister's former classmate. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the Gestapo, but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her. He agrees to keep her safe, on the condition she reveals her ""Jew secrets"" so he can write a book for Klenzendorf, which amuses him. Elsa plays along and makes up stories that Jews have special powers, such as mind-reading. Jojo is angry with his mother for hiding a Jew, accusing her of being unpatriotic. Rosie dismisses his accusations; she believes that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression. Jojo continues to interrogate Elsa, learning she has a boyfriend called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Having potential feelings for her himself, Jojo forges a letter from ""Nathan"" which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Jojo feels guilty seeing her cry, and writes another letter retracting the first one, and argues with Adolf when he suggests Elsa is a monster. Later, while collecting metal, Jojo spots his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" message in town. Jojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz (Stephen Merchant), visit his house. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be his sister Inge, their suspicions seem to be subsided when she confirms her birthday from memory. But Elsa realises she recited the wrong date, and that Klenzendorf, who also happened to arrive at the house during the visit, covered for her, she is confident she will be found out. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa, but she comforts him when he breaks down. Jojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him Hitler has committed suicide and that the Allies are closing in. A battle rages in the town, during which Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), arming and sacrificing children, is killed in an explosion. As the American and Soviet forces arrive, several Germans are captured, including a wounded Klenzendorf, who sacrifices himself to allow a captured Jojo to escape. The soldiers expel Jojo as Klenzendorf claims he is a Jew; he runs away as shots are heard. Jojo runs home, he wants to stop Elsa from leaving, so he lies, tells her that Germany won the war. Jojo gives her a ""new"" letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have found a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that her boyfriend died the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him in a ""little brother"" way. The imaginary Hitler confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Jojo takes Elsa outside, where she realises the Allies have won after seeing American soldiers. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street. Also starring Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen as Finkel. Griffin Davis is a fantastic new young talent, Johansson is really good in her short time onscreen, the support of Rockwell, Wilson and Merchant are also great, and Waititi almost steals the show as the immature imaginary Nazi dictator the boy talks to. This works really well, seeing the war from the point-of-view of a child who is unaware of the full magnitude of it, obviously there is serious material, including anti-Semitism and the Nazi dictatorship, but it is funny and pokes fun where it can, not for everyone, but for me an enjoyable satirical wartime comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Taika Waititi, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, Original Music for Michael Giacchino, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,5/10,"I'm usually quite decisive when it comes to rating films, but Jojo Rabbit has me in a bit of a quandry. I enjoyed the touching storyline of 10-year-old 'Hitler youth' Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) befriending Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl he finds hiding in his home. And I enjoyed the general irreverent tone and quirky satire. But I didn't laugh. Not once. And since I believe this is intended to be a comedy, I can't say that it is a complete success. A rating of 5 feels a little unfair, since the film is an undeniably unique and visually impressive experience, but at the same time it seems like a reasonable score for something that has left me feeling unsatisfied as a whole.I definitely wish that Roman Griffin Davis and Archie Yates (who plays Jojo's friend Yorki) hadn't filmed an introduction for the preview I attended: it made it harder to accept them as their characters, which, to be honest, wasn't that easy in the first place because neither is particularly convincing. The adults are far better, with Stephen Merchant as a nasty Gestapo officer Deertz almost making me smile, and Sam Rockwell shining as Captain Klenzendorf, a disillusioned soldier who isn't as bad as he first seems. Director Taika Waititi mercilessly mocks Adolf Hitler, who appears to Jojo as an imaginary friend - he's fun (but not funny). Scarlett Johansson is extremely likeable as Jojo's loving mother, and even Rebel Wilson, who I normally can't stand, was bearable as cruel Nazi Fraulein Rahm.5/10. I might like it more on a second viewing. Then again, I might dislike it more."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,6/10,"Right, well I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I sat down to watch the 2019 movie ""Jojo Rabbit"", except for knowing it to be a comedy of sorts and that it was set during World War II.I must say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a very unique movie, and it was a funny approach for a movie revolving around events of World War II. This is definitely not something you'd see in other war movies. For better or worse, some might not like it, however, I happened to enjoy it quite a lot. It was a refreshing take on a matter as serious as World War II.And director and writer Taika Waititi managed to create a movie that had equal amounts of seriousness and comedy to it, in a way that really worked well in favor of the movie. To Taika Waititi's praise, I must say that this movie was enjoyable, quirky, sure, but enjoyable.The movie had wonderful props, sets and costumes, and they had a glorious cast ensemble to perform the various roles in the movie. I must say that I really enjoyed the performance of Taika Waititi in the role of Adolf Hitler, that was just brilliant and hilarious. I was surprised to see Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson in a movie such as this, but they complimented the movie quite well. I think it was a shame that Rebel Wilson didn't have a larger part in the movie, because her character had so much to offer.I enjoyed ""Jojo Rabbit"" from start to end, and I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch this odd war movie. Lots of laughs throughout the course of the movie. This is definitely well worth the money, effort and time to sit down and watch.I am rating the movie six out of ten stars."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Not knowing what to expect, after about 8 minutes she said ""This is all pretty silly."" And the first 10 to 15 minutes are indeed pretty silly, in effect making fun of the German Nazis and their training of their youth to be men of Hitler. And how to hate Jews.The title comes from the main character, a boy of 10 whose nickname is Jojo. As a test he is ordered to kill a rabbit with his bare hands. Not being that cruel he tried to let the rabbit go, and to run, so the older Nazi boys started calling him ""Jojo Rabbit"" as a demeaning label.The story changes tenor when Jojo hears some noise upstairs at home and being a good detective finds a teenage Jewish girl in a secret hiding place in his attic. Jojo's mother (Johanssen) has put her up so that she will avoid arrest and death. As the story develops the boy and the girl form an unlikely bond. They come to love each other as brother and sister.Frankly I'm still not sure what I think of the movie as a whole, I know it got awards and was nominated for ""Best Picture"" but being very unconventional I still don't know where I rank it. I need to watch it again before I return the DVD."
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,7/10,"I'm a big fan of Taika Waititi. His film What We Do In the Shadows is one that I've introduced to so many people and given to just as many as a gift. His take on Thor pretty much changed the Marvel cinematic universe for the better and is the proof of goodness I point to when people naysay superhero films. And he's also been behind some intriguing fare like Eagle vs. Shark, Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, all while playing memorable roles like Korg in the Marvel films, Viago in What We Do In the Shadows and IG-11 in The Mandalorian.His take on Christine Leunens's book Caging Skies intrigued me from the first previews. While he was slated to work on a live action adaption of Akira - Hollywood won't give up on trying - this was a different movie that needed a deft hand. Luckily, Waititi was that hand.Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis in his first role) is a ten-year-old boy who is a member of Hitlerjugend, the Nazi youth movement. His father is supposedly fighting on the Italian Front, his sister has recently died and all he has left is his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Oh yeah - and his best and imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler (Waititi).Jojo and his best friend Yorki attend a training camp, run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell, as always wonderful), who keeps failing at nearly everything. When ordered to kill a rabbit, Jojo finds that he cannot, earning the nickname Jojo Rabbit. To get back in the graces of the other young Nazis, Hitler convinces Jojo to throw a grenade without permission, which gives him facial scars and a limp.A demoted Klenzendorf is asked by Jojo's mother to include her son, so he is given the job of spreading propaganda and collecting scrap metal.Meanwhile, Rosie is hiding Jewish girl Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie, Leave No Trace) in her home. The revelation that Jewish people aren't monsters, as well as the end of the war and his mother's role in being against the Nazis will change Jojo's view of the world.Notably, every Nazi in the film is comedically ineffective, from Rebel Wilson as Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz and Alfie Allen as the second-in-command Finkel. The town's stand against the Allies and Russians is well-nigh laughable, but also strangely heartbreaking. There's been some criticism that the Nazis are shown in a good light at times in this film and as comedic foils at others. To me, they're shown as objects of derision, paper villains that easily crumble when the real world intrudes. Klenzendorf sees himself as one of the heroic Aryan ideal that winds up in military finery in well-lit paintings with a Wagnerian soundtrack, but the best that he can do is spit in Jojo's face to save his life."
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,,"This film set in Nazi Germany is really quite different from the rest. It approaches the difficult and painful topic in a light hearted manner, while still maintaining respect. The ending leaves many things to the unsaid, which makes it more powerful. I enjoyed it a lot."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,8/10,"Now I am not a fan of children in films so approached this with more than a soupçon of trepidation. Well you can shoot me down in flames - Roman Griffin Davis is superb, simply superb. Can an 11 year old get an Oscar nomination? The story is quite surreal; a young Hitlerjugend (Nazi youth) discovers that his mother is harbouring a young Jewish girl under the eaves of their roof. What should he do? He's got Taika Waititi (aka Hitler) in his head preaching Nazi Arian philosophy at him whilst his own humanity (and curiosity) is guiding him elsewhere. Scarlett Johansson and the slightly sexually ambiguous pairing of Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen are great at keeping the whole thing going and it's funny and inventive from start to finish. Special mentions for Archie Yates as his pal ""Yorki"" and Davis' acting coach Rachel House who has done a splendid job."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,7/10,"This seems to be a case of Divisive We Stand, United We Fall. If we DID need yet another satiric take on World War Two then this is as good as any and can be placed alongside Bergnini's Life Is Wonderful, Wilder's A Foreign Affair and others of the same ilk albeit different wars. Once again (Life Is Beautiful) the director takes a leading role and once again it does no harm. Kudos all round."
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,9/10,"World War 2. Jojo is a 10-year-old German boy and a zealous follower of Hitler. He even has an imaginary friend, Adolf, who resembles Hitler and who motivates him and guides his actions. Then one day he finds a Jewish girl hiding in his house.Superb. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed the excellent 'What We Do In the Shadows' plus 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' and 'Boy' and directed 'Thor: Ragnarok'. While Waititi is more renowned as a comedic director (though many of his films have dramatic elements to them), Jojo Rabbit is a great balance between comedy and drama.Initially this combination of comedy and drama is a bit jarring, as you'll have some great comedy moments mixed in with some deadly serious, even tragic, dramatic moments. One moment you'll have an hilarious scene where the Nazis are being made fun of, the next you see the tragic effects of their regime. This two-tone approach initially makes the movie quite unsettling.However, from a point the comedy-drama divide follows a rhythm and things settle down. As the movie goes on the tone becomes more consistently serious, leading to a powerful, profound, emotional conclusion.Solid performances by Ronan Griffin Davis as Jojo, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa and Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. Waititi himself takes on the Hitler role and does a great job. Outstanding performance of the movie goes to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, the jaded, alcoholic German Army officer. Absolutely hilarious.Good supporting cast that includes Alfie Allen, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant."
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,9/10,"JOJO RABBIT (2019) *** 1/2 Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Archie Yates. Wonderful and gloriously off-the-wall comedy set in Nazi Germany with newcomer Griffin Davis as a young German boy caught up with Hitler (even to the point of the Fuhrer being his imaginary friend played with gusto by filmmaker Waititi who adapted the novel by Christine Leunens, 'Caging Skies' and scoring an Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation in the process) while befriending a Jewish adolescent (McKenzie) conflicting with his 'beliefs' and good conscience as a human being. While outrageous and skirting black comedy and good taste the film not only satirizes the horrid horde but illustrates how repugnant hatred truly is."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,8/10,"So I didn't even really want to see ""Jojo Rabbit"" that much based on the reviews, the kind of movie the reviews confirmed it to be, and my past experience with Taika Waititi's style. I thought it would be another Wes Anderson rip-off, and I wasn't in the mood for another ""aren't Nazis goofy?"" comedy that tries to make light of the Holocaust by making Nazis look like buffoons (no thank you, ""Life Is Beautiful."")But the movie buff in me hates not having an opinion about movies that strike a chord with the public, and the Academy Award completist in me wasn't sure I could live with myself if I didn't see every movie nominated for Best Picture this year. So I sucked it up and bought a ticket.My 10 year old son is studying the Holocaust in school, and his class had recently gone to a Holocaust museum in the Chicago area, so I asked him if he wanted to see this movie with me. It was his first time attending a ""grown up"" movie (""Star Wars"" films aside, if those are considered to be grown up movies). He was clearly very proud to be attending a PG-13 movie with his dad, and the experience was made sweeter for him by the fact that his younger brother had to stay home (I couldn't tell from the parental advisory whether or not it would be appropriate for an 8 year old). So there I am watching a movie about a 10 year old boy sitting next to my 10 year old boy, and man did I get the feels. Everything people have criticized this movie for is true. It paints a very sanitized picture of Nazi Germany and downplays how awful it would have been to live it. The Holocaust is a vague spectre somewhere in the background, never overtly shown and never feeling like a serious threat. The message is big and obvious, the emotional manipulation rampant.But what the hell. I kind of fell in love with this movie because of who I was seeing it with, and I loved that it was about learning to differentiate between the world as certain people (relatives, the media, our government, you name it) want you to perceive it and the world as you actually experience it. Yes, I knew my heartstrings were being tugged, and me in a different mood would have had none of it. But me in the mood I was in was all ""oh, let my heartstrings be tugged.""I also have never picked a worse time to go to the bathroom during a movie in my entire movie watching career. I can't go into details without throwing in a major spoiler, but let's just say my son had to tell me what happened when I got back and I had to wonder if my absence during that critical moment would traumatize my son forever. But he was fine.Grade: A"
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2020,10/10,"10 year hold Jojo lives with his mother Rosie in a small German town while his father is way. It is the closing days of the war, and Jojo is an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth. He idolises Hitler so much that Adolf is his imaginary friend. But there is a disturbing incident at the Hitler Youth camp, and there is also a family secret.Taika Waititi scripted, directed, and plays Adolf, and has done an extraordinary job in all three roles. This filmsteps lightly back and forth between laugh-out-loud humour and bleak despair, making the latter all the more poignant. This is a film with a very, very good script.It is also blessed with very good performances, but I must single out 12-year old Roman Griffin Davis. His central role holds this film again, developing from a naive, wide-eyed child to a boy who has been rudely pushed into adulthood, yet who still retains the essential innocence with which the viewer falls in love during the first few minutes of the film. It is an assured portrait of a not-very-assured character.This is an exceptional film."
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2019,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel ""Caging Skies"" as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.One wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.Playing over the opening credits is the German version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in ""Springtime for Hitler"" in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.Jojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.Things change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this ""nice"" Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.Waititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The ""Heil Hitler"" count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and an extended Monty Python skit.It's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident. Now, please pass the unicorn."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,3/10,There is potential in the idea of a Nazi spoof but the creators are not up to par. The standard of humor or writing is very low. Where is Mel Brooks when you need him. This movie tries too hard cramming slapstick or unfunny jokes. The result is their are some funny moments but they are few and far between. The bad jokes spoil the effect of the few funny ones. When things turn serious and dramatic with the bombing it's more interesting but just too little too late. The spoof just does not work here.Rebel Wilson has the best accent and delivery. And the best lines. Scarlett Johansson as mother has a strange accent. Sam Rockwell gives a lazy performance. The Hitler imaginary friend overacts and he's the director.The movie only gets better at the end. So it neither succeeds as a comedy or a drama Or a spoof. Go watch the Producers for comedy or the Book Thief for drama instead.
JOJO RABBIT,3 August 2020,8/10,"Taika Waititi wrote the screenplay version of Christine Leunens' best selling novel CAGING SKIES, directed, and stars in this parody of Nazi Germany (Waititi actually portrays Adolf Hitler - as an imaginary companion to the lead young boy) - a fresh bit of thoughtful parody from New Zealand!Approaching the grim aspects of WW II Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and the youth movement that influenced young people to become committed to Nazism - as viewed through a child's eyes, makes for an at times disturbing film while at other times a bit over the top parody. As the film company's synopsis outlines, 'A World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.' Add to this cast the presence of Sam Rockwell as the flexible Captain Klenzendorf, Jojo's best friend Yorkie as portrayed by Archie Yates among others and the film's impact is both entertaining and gripping.At times a bit overwrought (but that is to be expected in a satire), the overall response is one of quiet nodding about he atrocities that happened and the understanding of that time we must all remember."
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,9/10,"It's been awhile now since I watched a movie that was special and by that I mean a movie that you will remember for a long time. Most of the time you only remember movies that were extremely bad or/and the ones that are worth winning awards. Jojo Rabbit deserves its award, Taika Waititi did an excellent job with this war satire. As a comedy it's just genious, the mockery of the Germans or more specifically the Nazis, the satire just drips off it for the entire movie. Making fun of one of the greatest tragedies ever, it's delicate and doesn't work all the time, but in this movie they just laugh about anything and everything, sometimes subtle and sometimes very obvious. I thought it was great and I won't be the only one thinking like that. The cast was top notch. The young Roman Griffin Davis did a great job playing that little Hitlerjungend Jojo. The imaginary Hitler played by Taika Waititi was a great addition to this story. The whole cast added everything needed to make Jojo Rabbit one of the better movies of 2019. If you need to relativize life a little bit, if you like to mock Nazis, Jojo Rabbit is what you need."
JOJO RABBIT,8 April 2020,8/10,"The film is very well acted. I liked even the little kid. I didn't read anything about the movie and I kind of expected to be a contemporary film about a child with Hitler as an imaginary friend, but no, it's a WWII movie, seen from the perspective of a child. I would put it in the same category as La vita è bella, but not as good. Sam Rockwell's character was great.The only problem with the film, I believe, is that it quickly became predictable. The imaginary Hitler had no real impact on the story, while the characters quickly fell into familiar cliches: the innocent child, the beautiful Jew, the happy, beautiful, artistic and intelligent parent who makes said child's life wonderful even in the midst of war, the tragic hero, the cardboard evil Nazis. I would have loved a movie about a contemporary American child with Hitler as his imaginary friend, getting him in trouble, but you need balls to do that.As for people who felt ""offended"", it's a classic Nazis are bad story. I am still waiting for a true dramatic story of actual Nazis who are also human, without the need for saving Jews. That would be even less offensive, mind you, but you wouldn't get it."
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2019,,"""Yeah, I know, definitely not a good time to be a Nazi."" Yorki (Archie Yates)As Nazi youth in Jojo Rabbit are caught in bad times just before liberation, so too is the campy film caught tonally between the lyrical fantasy of Springtime for Hitler and the heavy mockery of Inglourious Basterds. But not to fear, Jojo's (Roman Griffin Davis)
imaginary friend, Hitler (director Taika Waitti), is an ineffectual bumbler, who gives Jojo solace in rough times.If you hate Hitler, you'll enjoy the satire; if you love him, well, you can enjoy news about your favorite dictator and skip this satire.Jojo, himself an ineffectual and impossibly cute 10-year-old, not only has to face the dwindling power of the Reich but also the fact that his mother, Rosie (Scarlet Johansson), is harboring a young Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).Anne Frank anyone? Like so many participants in that WWII scenario, Jojo must decide between party loyalty and humanity when he decides whether or not to report Elsa.In the first part of the film, so much is lighthearted (think Hogan's Heroes or Life is Beautiful), that you could forget the baseline horror, which the film treats as Wes Anderson might with serio-comic attitude. Helping to lighten things is hipster anachronistic dialogue like ""intense"" and ""correctamundo"" and slapstick set pieces that ease the inevitable tension from hinting at Holocaust.The second part turns melancholic when Jojo decides what to do with his ""girlfriend"" Elsa and the Allies are about to change everything. The tone is right, between the uncomfortable struggle before the allies arrive and the new freedom that will demand a maturity and independence Jojo has never had under the Nazis.Writer-director Taika Waititi has crafted a powerful yet delicate comedy of the world's most horrible story. For attempting to satirize Nazis and be poignant and positive, he should be praised. For the feel-good ending, he should again be rewarded, even if it feels counter intuitive given the horrific history.""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a ten-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club."" Elsa"
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,6/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is one film that as you watch you enjoy the fun and the laughs as you see the world thru the eyes of a young man during war time in Germany. The themes of love, hate, and murder all blend with fantasy and joy.Roman Griffin Davis is Jojo a little boy who wants to train to be in Hitler's army only he already has the evil ruler as his imaginary friend. Things then become turned upside down when his finds and his mother(Scarlett Johansson) reveals that she is keeping a young Jewish girl hidden upstairs! It's like it's a whole new world. Only the film explores tolerance, pain, and love in a new light.Overall good comedy like drama that's fun with change and human feel proving that all people deep down are just alike."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,8/10,"""You cannot not hark back to Roberto Benigni's well-wrought laughter/lachrymose diptych LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1997) when you are watching JOJO RABBIT, the former (which this reviewer just re-watched recently on the big screen), albeit often too facile in its second-half concentration camp tall story, holds firmly the distinction of infusing a modicum of hope and innocence in the face of inconceivable man-made horror and adversity, and Taika Waititi's sixth feature strives for the same aim, but by dint of a droll satire embedded with a cutesy Wes Anderson-esque mise en scène.""keep reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
JOJO RABBIT,2 March 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit skillfully offers the eccentric story of a 10-year-old German boy who worships Hitler - and has him for a genial imaginary friend - against the horrific backdrop of World War II in the third Reich's final days.The cast is excellent, with Roman Griffin Davis appealing as the little Nazi whose better angels sometimes peak out, Thomasin McKenzie as a feisty Jewish girl in hiding, Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's sweet, stylish mother, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Nazi kooks, and director Taika Waititi as imaginary Hitler.The movie manages to walk a very fine line between wacky comedy and searing horror. It is sometimes painfully intense and heartbreaking, but it is also at times genuinely funny.Highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,2/10,"I like taika waititi a lot. i think his brand of humor is smart and never basic. this movie wasn't funny. i was bored for most of it. not even sam rockwell or scarlett johanson could add some value. they gave good performances but i didn't feel like it made the movie any better.the movie is well made for the most part. if only i was entertained. another example of the oscars loving movies i hate (1 viewing, 2/18/2020)"
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,8/10,"Waititi's secret weapon is, as it always has been, his uncanny ability to provoke genuine emotion even in the broadest of comedies. This is what makes 'Jojo Rabbit (2019)', which is brazenly bizarre on paper, work as well as it does. The characters are crafted to be much more than the humourous archetypes they initially threaten to be; they're actually rather nuanced and their relationships all feel palpable. They have arcs which are predictable yet satisfying, which are evocative of the entire affair. The flick may be a comedy, but it makes a point of having its tragedies hit home incredibly hard. There are more than a few emotionally resonant moments, each strong enough to provoke tears and bolster the underlying truth of the story's situation. The picture wisely depicts its central situation as properly bleak, showing exactly what its more outlandish elements actually cost. Its easy to poke fun at the Nazis, but it's necessary to make sure their deplorable acts never get the same treatment. Luckily, this handles the dilemma rather well. It walks the line but it's never distasteful, with its 'anti-hate' messages always feeling evident. The movie is broadly funny, with several (somewhat uncomfortable) laughs and a generally heightened world. It sometimes struggles to balance its satiric humour with its genuine heart, though. Basically, it's a bit odd, tonally. Plus, it isn't all that complex; it's message is (hopefully) obvious. Sadly, it's easy to imagine unknowing children 'heil'-ing Hitler in the street because they saw it here, the satire having gone over their ignorant little heads, but I suppose Waititi's responsibility only goes so far. I mean, the affair is clearly positioned against Nazism. It's entertaining, affecting, funny, heartbreaking and, generally, very well-made. It walks the line, and wobbles a bit while doing it, but it never falls off and it reaches a satisfying conclusion. 8/10"
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,5/10,"In 1940 The Little Tramp was a Jewish barber living under the shadow of Nazism and his alter ego, Charlie Chaplin was Adolf Hitler, or rather Adenoid Hynkel, ""The Great Dictator"" since, even in a Chaplin comedy in 1940, poking actual fun at 'Hitler' himself might have seemed out of the question. A couple of years later, while the War was still ongoing. Ernst Lubitsch made ""To Be or Not to Be"". another very funny about the Nazis that even included the line, 'So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt', and in 1968 Mel Brooks had the temerity to stage a bad-taste musical called 'Springtime for Hitler' in his film ""The Producers"" with a spaced-out hippy called L.S.D as Hitler. The film was pronounced the funniest film ever made by Peter Sellers and roundly condemned by the British critic Dilys Powell who found the whole idea repulsive.The point is that Hollywood has always seen fit to take something as monstrous as Nazism and make fun of it. Actual Holocaust jokes they have stayed clear of though the Italian Roberto Benigni had no such qualms when he made ""Life is Beautiful"". Hollywood applauded him with a number of Oscars. Now it's the turn of the New Zealand born writer, director and actor Taika Waititi who has combined the Mel Brooks approach with the Benigni approach in his movie ""JoJo Rabbit"" with very mixed results.In these supposedly more politically enlightened times the argument has run, is it right to joke about Hitler and the Nazis and most of ""JoJo Rabbit's"" critics have tended to come from the moral Right and to give Mr Waititi his dues he has pushed the boat out here. The hero is a ten year old member of the Hitler Youth whose imaginary friend is none other than the Fuhrer himself and he's played by Waititi much in the style of Dick Shawn's L.S.D. Indeed, the first thiry minutes or so are very funny if, like me, you enjoy bad taste and have a Brooksian sense of humour and then it all goes disasterously wrong. Waititi gets serious with a major sub-plot involving a young Jewish girl hiding in the attic, (a kind of Anne Frank minus the family), and our youthful hero undergoes a change of heart from Nazi sympathiser to love-struck puppy while there are long, glum patches with not a laugh in sight but much squirming in the seat. It does pick up a little towards the end with the reintroduction of some more bad tasted gags and scenes that resemble a kind of comic version of ""Germany Year Zero"" but by then I had basically given up the ghost.On the plus side it is very well acted. When he's not required to be serious young Roman Griffin Davis is fine as JoJo though it's Archie Yates as his friend Yorki who comes close to stealing the movie. Scarlett Johansson is also superb as JoJo's mother, a German sympathiser to the Jewish cause while Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant are both brilliant as 'comic' Nazis, one basically a nice guy and the other just the kind of Nazi we all love to hate and Rebel Wilson is splendidly over-the-top as a Nazi who is basically just a baby-making machine. As the girl in the attic, Thomasin McKenzie is basically wasted.
So a film of two halves, the better half being the tasteless one when the villains are reduced to ludicrous caricatures. When he puts on his serious face, however, Waititi just ends up by being scantimonious."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2021,8/10,"It was really nice movie. It made me laugh,it made me sad,it made me think, everything in less than 2 hours. I loved certain scenes of this film. First of all, the track at the beginning was amazing. Second, when Jojo was dancing with his mother, it was really funny and cute to see. I loved the cliques about Jews, they were really funny. I liked caricatured Hitler, he was pretty soft. I wanted to see more of that amazing actress(that we all know - Rebel Wilson), but I liked the idea that this movie was full of Hollywood stars, but they didn't take place from main character - Jojo. I can say, that Jojo is the best young actor that I've seen like in 10 years period, which is very amazing. I put this film in top 10 movies of 2019(in my list) and I highly recommend to everyone watch this movie, it really worth your attention!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,8/10,"'Jojo Rabbit', Taika Waititi's film arouses controversy among film critics and viewers. Normal for a satirical comedy dealing with the darkest period in history? Perhaps, however, we should not be so shocked anymore, and not because almost eight decades have passed since the horrific events, but because World War II, the Holocaust and even Hitler's persona have already been subjects of comedy and satire in numerous films, some even very good - starting with Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator', continuing with the French comedies with Louis de Funes, moving on to Roberto Benigni's superb and moving film 'Life is Beautiful' and reaching Tarantino. And yet, Taika Waititi was able to make this film only by financing it as a producer and making it as a director and as an actor in the most delicate role - Adolf Hitler's as an imaginary friend of a ten-year-old boy raised in the poisonous atmosphere of the Third Reich and fanatical in his worship of the Fuhrer and in his hatred of Jews. The film describes the tragic coming to age and awakening to reality of Jojo, the aspiring Nazi child, unable to kill a rabbit, hence the nickname in the film's title, during a disastrous war ending for the world he believed in and he lived by until then.The directorial approach and the style in which the story is exposed, at least in the first part of the film, resembles nothing of what I saw on screens in the films about World War II. In fact, the film may be looked at differently: as a combination of coming to age and early exit from childhood movies in extreme conditions (Giuseppe Tornatore's 'Malena' would be another example) and an anti-racist and anti-militaristic satire with clear references to the contemporary period. As a film about the war and the Holocaust, 'Jojo Rabbit' does not say many new things. Jojo's conquering character splendidly played by Roman Griffin Davis, one of the most memorable children's roles of late, dominates the film. The world we see on the screen is his world, with the fears and imagination of a ten year old boy raised in the shadow of war and educated in a twisted ideology. The relationship between his mother (Scarlett Johansson) and Jojo is a relationship mixing love and fear, the mother's fear of the monster that her son might become, maternal protection combined with the fear that Jojo may, intentionally or not, denounce her for her opinions and actions.The film works very well in the first part, the grotesque kitsch of Nazi education and the sick fantasy of the kid's 'imaginary friend' Adolf Hitler managing to create the effects expected by the director. Things get a little complicated when Jojo discovers the ""enemy"", a Jewish girl his mother was hiding in their home at the risk of her life, and who, to his surprise, has neither horns nor tentacles. Here begins the process of awakening and coming to age, accelerated by the approach of the end of the war, which brings with it the destruction and death that the fanatical children born and educated in Nazism had been hitherto spared of. The story now slips into melodrama, not before providing one more grotesque and tense scene, when the family home is visited by Gestapo. The ending is less original, and the mix of dream (actually a nightmare in this phase) and reality is no longer as interesting. Until then, however, 'Jojo Rabbit' has already provided many interesting ideas, original and moving sequences, and a lesson that stays with the viewers about the grotesque of hate. Taika Waititi's film may not be an immediate public success, but its fame may develop and last into the future instead."
JOJO RABBIT,26 August 2020,10/10,"There are two ways of looking at the film 'Jojo Rabbit' - you can take a quick glance of the subject matter and see how a young boy in Second World War Germany has an imaginary friend who is none other than Adolf Hitler himself and say, 'That's no laughing matter' and therefore write the movie off as simply 'bad taste' and something that shouldn't be joked about. Or you can actually watch it and digest the deeper meaning behind it all. And, I think if you do, you'll find that it's one of the most original, deep and touching stories to come out of modern day Hollywood.Yes, our young protagonist, Jojo, (brilliantly played by the young Roman Griffin Davis) is part of the 1944 'Hitler Youth' project in Nazi Germany and he dreams of growing up to be one of Hitler's personal guards and ridding the Fatherland of various 'undesirable' groups - I'm sure you know what I mean. And, to 'help' him along the way, he has imagined how the Furher himself would be and has created a fictional version of Adolf Hitler (again, perfectly lampooned by the film's writer/director Taika Waititi). Now, you may think this is hardly a protagonist you could root for. However, the film goes to great lengths to point out how this youngster is merely the product of his brief lifetime of constant brainwashing by the ruling party. In short, this film is more about the dangers of indoctrination rather than promoting any form of ideology.Of course there are many moments that are played for laughs. The movie goes to great lengths to point out how this imaginary Hitler is not the REAL Hitler and is merely how a young boy might interpret how his 'glorious' leader would be, i.e. quite a fun, playful character (who also just happens to want to murder lots of people).Besides the two characters I've already mentioned, 'Jojo Rabbit' is littered by famous faces who all turn in excellent performances. Scarlett Johansson is heavily promoted and, although good, I felt was overshadowed by Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant whenever they were on screen. Besides these 'heavy hitters' Thomasin McKensie deserves a special mention for being another youngster that can definitely hold her own among the stars and hopefully has a bright acting future ahead of her.Much of the humour seems to come in the first third of the film, but, as the story goes on, the film does start to descend into much darker territory where many horrors of war are depicted and there are certainly scenes which will leave you cold and stay with you forever.Overall, this film has something for everyone (who doesn't take offense at the mere mention of the subject matter). It could be considered essential viewing for anyone looking to see how the horrors of war effect those forced to live under such conditions and serve as a reminder that we shouldn't always trust those who lead us.Plus, if nothing else convinces you to watch this, you also have excellent versions of The Beatles and David Bowie classic songs (albeit in German, which is definitely a novelty!)."
JOJO RABBIT,5 November 2019,9/10,"I've always said that a great ending can elevate your opinion on the film as a whole. Perhaps not completely shift how you feel, but certainly enhance or detract. I was enjoying the ride with Jojo Rabbit for awhile but I was waiting for the film to move me emotionally the way I'd heard it might. The last 15-20 minutes of the movie do just that. Boasting a hilarious script, unique direction from Taika, terrific performances all around, and a message that is as moving as any film this year, Jojo Rabbit is a win on all accounts. And perhaps, just the movie we need at this time. I absolutely adored this film.9.4/10"
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,,"Overall, this was an enjoyable film, even though it wasn't perfect. It is still recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,5/10,"A timely film, given the rise of populist leaders whispering vile things into the thoughts of the masses. It's set in Nazi Germany, but those who promote hatred and insanity over love and rationality in all generations - particularly this one - are probably the target here. It's a film about perseverance, showing us that all of these types of leaders will pass eventually, and for that it should get credit.The film is very ambitious in attempting both comedy and drama, and in such a highly sensitive context. For me, the comedy fell flat, and I didn't feel it was all that appropriate either. Its heart was in the right place and there were dark scenes to point out at least some of the atrocities which took place, but overall it felt just a little too glib. I was really squirming through the first half because I knew what it was going for, but didn't think it was adding anything insightful to the conversation. There are some nice moments in the back half, but by then it was too little, too late.The dancing quote from Scarlett Johansson's character was nice (""we have to dance to show God we are grateful to be alive""), but the dancing at the end - even with the Rilke quote - seemed way off in tone to me. It seems to forget that after such nightmarish horror and personal loss, there are long stages of bereavement before such joy can be expressed. It's hard for me to fathom what an audience in 1945 would have thought of it."
JOJO RABBIT,29 February 2020,7/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" follows in the rich tradition of making buffoons out of Hitler and Nazis, from Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940), Ernst Lubitsch's ""To Be or Not to Be (1942) and Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" (1967). And, from the start, it's a hilarious successor to those films. The opening credits roll over a montage ludicrously equating Hitler with the Beatles. Beyond the jokes, however, is where I find the picture falters. While some critics appear to fret over the definition of ""satire"" and beg for a lecture that readily applies to today's politics, all of that is rather irrelevant to Taika Waititi's actual movie. Today, we're far removed from WWII; it's no longer the present of Chaplin and Lubitsch's films or part of mainstream living memory as with Brooks. The historical horrors of Nazi Germany are conspicuously absent from ""Jojo Rabbit""--reduced to and rendered mostly by hangings in a town square. Meanwhile, the ground has been softened for a cartoonish Hitler and Nazis recently by re-subtitled videos on YouTube of a scene from ""Downfall"" (2004) or a movie such as ""Look Who's Back,"" (2015) featuring a Hitler interacting with modern Germans, as well as by everything from ""Hogan's Heroes"" to those finer films by Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. There's hardly anything enlightening or subversive about the humor here, but it's the picture's inevitable sentimentality and derivative style that are the bigger shortcomings.I've only seen two of his movies thus far, but it's striking how much Waititi rips off from others' movies. His MCU entry, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) stylistically plays like the third installment to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series, what with the goofball posing to popular music, not to mention the teaming up of misfit prisoners, violent family dynamics and threat of planetary destruction. Now, in this Chaplin-Lubitsch-Brooks-esque black comedy, or satire, or what have you, he lifts the look and sound of Wes Anderson's pictures. Others have aptly compared the Hitler Youth bits and coming-of-age story here to ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012), but with war-mongering white supremacists. Moreover, actors play cute, are framed centrally for cuts back and fourth or are otherwise symmetrically lined up for the camera, bright colors pop, the mood veers wildly between comedic excess and sentimentality, all underscored, again, by popular music, from the Beatles onward. Ironically, Anderson's own picture to be set in the era of WWII, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014), is an exception musically among his oeuvre. Both directors even include some good cigarette jokes. Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler repeatedly offering the boy a smoke might be the funniest bit regarding cancer sticks that I recall since Bill Murray would suck on up to two of them at a time in ""Rushmore"" (1998).Never mind that the real Hitler was the original former smoker turned anti-smoking Nazi. Or that Hitler's vegetarianism is ignored here in favor of his imaginary version feasting on unicorn heads, or that much of Waititi's interpretation of him revolves around anachronisms. This is historical revisionism to the point of pop-culture memes. The bigoted boy scout, Jojo's other secret friend besides silly führer is, as a Jewish girl living in his attic, helping him to compose a book (in this case, one full of anti-Semitic tropes), a simplistic variation on Anne Frank. There's also the business of dance standing in for freedom here. It pales in comparison to the artistic reflexivity that lifted the works of Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. Chaplin exploited the duality inherent in cinema and the dramedy of humor and horror of his scenario by playing dual roles. Lubitsch did likewise with the play-within-play structure, of actors playing actors. Ditto Brooks. All included sham Hitlers. Waititi's Hitler, on the other hand, is simply imaginary--reflecting the ideology Jojo has absorbed from the culture and propaganda of Nazi Germany. Minus the bigotry of it all, it's not unlike what Waititi has done in his cinematic copycatting. And, in the end, all we get is a trite moral from the boy's budding friendship with the girl in his attic, to not hate... and dance, or something.Regardless, I still enjoyed ""Jojo Rabbit."" The comedy is naturally not as edgy as when Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks made Nazis the butt of jokes, but even when the humor here is juvenile, it tends to be enough over-the-top to remain fun. Scarlett Johansson is especially a delight in her Oscar-nominated role--perhaps, particularly because hers is the only character that seems to acknowledge the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich, although she, too, frolics about in the spring with her son, Jojo. Newcomer Roman Griffith Davis, as Jojo, is impressive, besides also looking convincingly like he could be related to Johansson. The rest of the cast is serviceable, including Sam Rockwell reprising his Oscar-winning violent racist who performs a redemptive act of kindness for another from ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017). If the characters here weren't mostly reused caricatures, though, and if Jojo running around when the war finally does reach his sleepy village didn't resemble Corporal Upham hiding throughout a recycled set from ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1999), if Waititi didn't crib so much from Anderson and others in general and resort to a predictably sugary denouement, I wouldn't be ambivalent in my enjoyment."
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,,"An antidote to hate, prejudice & fearmongering that appears to be on the rise of lately, Jojo Rabbit takes a provocative subject matter, fills it up with heart, soul & compassion, and exquisitely juggles the hilarious with the serious to surprise us all as one of the most delightful, affectionate & endearing films of the year.Written & directed by Taika Waititi (best known for What We Do In the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople & Thor: Ragnarok), the film is an audaciously handled satire that blatantly parodies everything Nazi, and attempts to capture the utter absurdity of such ideologies by illustrating it all from a 10-year old's perspective.The lighthearted approach, simple-minded treatment & idiosyncratic characters inhabiting this black comedy do keep the fanciful tone alive n kicking but Waititi also makes sure that an undercurrent of seriousness is evident between the lines and the dramatic portions & dark moments do pack the required emotional punch.Adding more richness to the story is the sincere inputs from both the young & veteran members of the cast, each playing their roles with emotional honesty. Waititi himself portrays the childish, parodic version of Führer, and is amusing throughout. The interactions between characters remain interesting, plus their arcs exhibit genuine depth.On an overall scale, Jojo Rabbit is a witty, whimsical & warm-hearted effort from Taika Waititi that finds the Kiwi filmmaker doing what he does best and is another impressive addition to his repertoire. A passionately crafted satire with its heart at the right place, Jojo Rabbit might not appease every palate but its arrival is by all means a welcome one. Highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,11 December 2019,8/10,"Watching Jojo Rabbit is a peculiar experience. At times, this film is delightfully irreverent. Then suddenly the story becomes emotionally poignant. And then somehow it swings back to the silly again. The dark comedy feels almost ""verboten,"" but it's also kind of refreshing to see material like this in our increasingly hypersensitive world. Plus, Roman Griffin Davis gives an impressively nuanced performance as the titular character. I don't know how or why this movie works, but it truly does."
JOJO RABBIT,28 August 2021,8/10,"I would like to see this movie in the cinema.It's a fun and emotional movie.I enjoyed watching. Taika did a great job. As you know, that scene broke my heart :("
JOJO RABBIT,13 March 2020,10/10,"Some lines to illustrate the mocking, sardonic humor directed at hate politics.
""I wish more of our young boys had your blind fanaticism."" ""Just go and shoot anybody who looks different to us.""
""We must kill everything that we see. Heil, Hitler""But in counterbalance was this Rilke poem:
""Let everything happen to you
Beauty and terror
Just keep going
No feeling is final""Great sets, props, casting & acting, cinematography, directing, intelligent (when not satirical) dialogue. So many applications to current & historical nationalism & conflict."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019) is a movie during which i constantly told myself - this is the closest thing to ""La vita è bella"" i saw since that movie - because i love ""Life is Beautiful"". The only reason i did not find ""Jojo Rabbit"" perfect was that slapstick humor in the first half of the movie and a bit to much of ""Jews are not different from others revelations in the middle"". And i'm OK by that, it was pretty good, but later events of this film transpired its first half. The second half, and more of the 3rd act was simply perfect.Overall, i loved ""Jojo Rabbit"" second half. while its first half was just good. In a any way, this is a really good movie, superbly written and acted and directed."
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.I really liked ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019) for its good humor, touching story and third act which was pretty perfect in my opinion. This movie has reminded me of ""Life is Beautiful"", which is a good thing as that one i consider one of my all time favorites.Overall, there are tears and there are laughs in ""Jojo Rabbit"". It is a superbly written, acted and directed movie. Really good one."
JOJO RABBIT,20 December 2019,8/10,"A satire black comedy about making fun of Nazis is always going to be funny in my book; despite some people feelings about uncomfortable laughing at the subject matter. After all, 1940 Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece 'The Great Dictator' is one of my favorite movies of all time. Since humor is subjective some people might still find this movie a bit unfunny regardless if it has Nazis or not. On the other hand I really doubt that peace loving musicians like the Beatles found it funny to see the German version of their pop songs be turned into a represented of fascist cult of personality culture. Maybe David Bowie, but who knows. Nevertheless director Taika Waititi still went down the rabbit hole and delivered a surreal surface level humorous look of what life was like for the citizens of Nazi Germany by telling the story of young Hitler Youth member, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) finding out his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. Without spoiling this coming to age journey based on author Christine Leunens's book 'Caging Skies' too much, Waititi indeed put a rabbit out of his hat and delivered an unexpected magic trip through World War 2 in a boyhood whimsy child's perspective. The screenplay also written by the director didn't felt as bleak and harden as the more adult like writing approach the source material had. The film's story felt more dream like. The movie is also beautifully shot. There were several lingering shots focus intently on the mother's distinctive shoes foreshadowing future events that was a really nice touch. It's just too bad that it's really hard to figure out the timeline of events were as historical accuracies was somewhat tossed out of the window. Honestly for a director who explicitly did zero research on Adolf Hitler, he was also fine in his acting as the make believe friend version of the dictator who eat unicorn and smokes too much. While the whole imaginary best friend was not in the source material. The scenes with him and JoJo were charming, but also somewhat disturbing when it has to be to overlook that. It wasn't as deliberately light hearted vapid silly and corny offensive as 1990 British sitcom 'Heil Honey! I'm Home' which was cancelled after one episode. The filmmaker did show how brutal his teachings can honest be with the rabbit killing allegory scene. Much in the same way Walt Disney 'Education for Death: the Making of the Nazi' cartoon did in 1943. Nor does the filmmaker shy away from the many crimes that the Nazis had competed. The powerful emotional hanging scene is one such example. The way it was shot with shot of the feet lying lifeless is haunting. Then there was the intense suspenseful sequence involving the Gestapo led by a sinister agent Deertz played by Stephen Merchant coming to the titular character's home for a visit. That was very creepy. The film also even challenge the concept of war with JoJo challenge his mother's lack of patriotism. That scene with the mother acting like the father with the soot and her not breaking character in order to apologize for yelling is really commanding. Scarlet Johannsson's acting really capture that moment even if her character didn't seem so traditional mother like. It's very emotional and heart breaking. You really do see JoJo start to question his beliefs after that. So begins a tense, complex, and at times hilarious series of exchanges between Elsa brilliant played by McKenzie & himself. Roman's acting is truly amazing for somebody that young. Glad they made JoJo somewhat likeable. The character here is a lot more sympatric than the source material version who kept Elsa a slave for years after the war because he couldn't cope with losing. Also glad that the filmmaker didn't make them hate each other in the end like the book due to the confusion of possession for love. That was too much of a downer. Regardless one thing I didn't really get was what they were going with his mentorship with Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). I felt like that subplot got lost. Don't get me wrong, Rockwell's acting is pretty good as the tired bitter injury ex- Wehrmacht soldier, but what was the endgame for him. One minute he seem like he is bad mouthing the party's policies during the war during a lecture at the youth camp and turning a blind eye in order to protect JoJo from the Gestapo, but in the end, he's still fighting for the party. I guess it can be said that his loyalty is with protecting Germany, not the Nazis but it's not really explore or explain. It's difficultly to find a read on that character. It's frustrating but not quite hopping mad. I also found Archie Yates portrayal as Yorki, Jojo's best friend very amusing. However I felt that the character didn't have much to do besides spill exposition and be comedy relief. In truth a more tragic ending for him could had been really powerful for the film; much in the same way Piggy met his end in William Golding's novel 'The Lord of the Flies' showing the end of childhood's innocence. Still the movie was push the envelope enough. It didn't really play it safe. Overall: It's a pretty good film. The flick's messages about acceptance and tolerance is just as needed now as it did in 1945. There is a lot to relate to today's modern society. In the end, it's a wonderful motion picture that needs to be seen. So hop onto it & check it out!"
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,10/10,"I'm am so glad that I made the effort to actually get out and see this film because, well, it was mindblowing in so many ways, and pretty funny as well. In fact, it is one of those films that should be a definite watch for many people, particularly in light of the fact that it is about a young German boy living at the close of World War II. The thing is that this boy is 10, so he has not know of a world in which Hitler was not the ruler of Germany, and of course he has basically become brainwashed with all of the propaganda that is being churned out.Yet his views are about to become challenged, especially when he discovers a young girl hiding in his attic - a Jewish girl - and this is how the film plays out. He doesn't know who knows about the girl, and the girl isn't letting him know about anything either. So, it seems, in many cases, that he has been snookered - and his beliefs about the Jews are also being challenged, particularly once he is confronted by one.In a way what we are seeing is not just the undoing of Germany, but the undoing of this little boy's world. His father is missing, and his mother is everything, but it turns out that there is so much that he doesn't know, or understand. One interesting line is that he claims to be a Nazi, and this is rebuked because he isn't a Nazi, he just loves Swastikas.Yet it also confronts us with the reality of racism, of how we will demonise a certain group simply because they are different. The sad reality is that this seems to be happening all over again, yet there is a vast difference between the racism we see now, and the racism back then. They reality is that while we were horrified at what happened during World War II, this type of stuff was going on anyway in many of the allied countries.However, what is even more worrying is that the dogwhisting tactics that Hitler used to such great success are being used now, today, to turn us against our fellow humans. In reality the Jews weren't all that much different from us, and you couldn't actually tell the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew, though the dog whistling, and racial stereotypes are being painted of people that do look different. In particular, there is this whole 'failure to integrate' argument that is used to destroy a unique, and different, culture.Yes, this is definitely a timely movie, and a movie for the world that we live in now. It is just sad that those this film should be challenging aren't the people that will be seeing this film."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,9/10,Hilarious fun satire that very much reminded me of Moonrise Kingdom and El Salvador. A fair amount of Wes Anderson vibes and Oliver Stone which are both brilliant! Jojo Rabbit is a great unique well crafted and beautiful experience! I quite enjoyed this odd movie and highly recommend it.
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,9/10,"I just got out of Jo Jo RabbitMan, I loved this movie so much. My favourite movie of 2019.Roman Griffin Davis is wonderful, Thomason Mckenzie is a delight, Taika Waititi is awesome, as is Rebel Wilson, Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen, but it's Scarlett Johanson who leaves the biggest impression, I think she deserves to be nominated for best supporting actressThis deserves to be seen by as many people as possible."
JOJO RABBIT,3 August 2021,8/10,"At the start of the movie, I presumed 'Jojo Rabbit' to be slapstick, and almost stopped watching, as I HATE slapstick. However, I was so captivated by the exquisite photography and bright, crisp colors and beautiful cinematography that I simply couldn't stop watching!Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't. This was STUNNING!! At first I thought Hitler was a rather silly character, until I realized he was nothing more than an imaginary character - as imagined by a young boy with Nazi upbringing. Meet Jojo Rabbit - fantastically portrayed by newcomer Roman Griffin Davis (give this young lad an Oscar already!!). He simply was sensational as the titular character.The editing is fantastic. Through clever writing they managed to make serious issues fun to watch, which was most unusual. As the film progressed, the slapstick from the beginning dissipated and made room for some dramatic moments. Also note the clever satire. Many scenes were no laughing matter, and with respect treated as such.'Jojo Rabbit' was a stunning cinematic experience, and quite frankly one of the best films I've seen in a while. This is highly recommended. Towards the end, the film somehow reminded me of the brilliant 'Life is Beautiful'. Few movies as of late awoke as many senses as 'Jojo' did. This is a fantastic film that looks incredible on screen. This is a must see."
JOJO RABBIT,27 July 2020,6/10,There are things I love about this film and things I don't. The best part is the child's perspective. Taika Waititi continues this style from his previous film Boy (2010) which also showed the perspective of a young boy. There are a lot of quirky and creative takes on the setting like the imaginary Hitler. The rest of the story like the discovery of the Jewish girl and the theme of love conquering hate were trite though.
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,7/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we follow a young boy who is a member of Hitler's army finding out that his mother is hiding a girl at their house. Everything change for him and now he has to choose wisely what to do.I have to say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" was a good surprise for me because I didn't know what to expect from it. I enjoyed the movie because it combined very well comedy with drama and make me feel that I am a part of the movie. Taika Waititi did a great job on direction and he played very well as Adolf Hitler and in some moments he was simply hilarious. The interpretations of Roman Griffin Davis who played as Jojo, Thomasin McKenzie who played as Elsa and Sam Rockwell who played as Captain Klenzendorf were simply amazing."
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit (5 out of 5 stars).Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama film that goes over a dark serious event of WWII but with a little Taika Waititi's script and direction of humor, and charm. This film delivers. It is a lot of fun, has some quirky humor, a great cast, and a plot about a serious and dark issue but with a little heart in it. This kind of film is not going to be for everyone. It is what it is with this kind of movie. Audiences may have trouble connecting to the main character Jojo, a kid who is trying to be a Nazi. He is raised different, sees the world in a blind eye. But it is also a coming of age kind of story being caught in the world of conflict. It is one of those plots were it is best to see for yourself than read about it cause it does not sound appealing especially over the issue with the kid trying to be a nazi.The plot follows Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a young boy in Germany. His father is absent cause he is sent out in the war. And he lost his sister to some sickness. While his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is caring and sweet. Jojo is sent out to a boys camp for Hitler's youth training. Led by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), and his assistants Fraulen (Rebel Wilson) and Finkel (Alfie Allen). When an accident sends Jojo home. Jojo finds out his mother has been hiding a teenage jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). Jojo afraid and hesitant on living with this girl. He tries to aid in keeping her hidden.The plot is great. It is a coming of age story during WWII. And being raised to follow a Hitler's laws. Jojo's world is turned upside down when he sees that his mother is part of the resistance and helping a young girl hide in their home. Jojo was stuck in believing the horrible rumors on what he thought the Jews are. While learning from Elsa that her and him are not so different.The cast ensemble is great. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are great with the lead roles. They are sweet and delivered fun roles. Taika Waititi plays Adolf Hitler as a imagination that talks to Jojo. Jojo has an imaginary friend that is Hitler that tries to keep him company. Taika Waititi's performance humor is a lot of fun to watch. Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson are all great with their performances.The film's script and direction is a lot of fun. The characters are fun. The humor is entertaining. And the story is charming and goes over a serious dark time about loss and friendships.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a great film. It is entertaining. Fun. And charming with its story. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,7/10,"One of the most well-liked and instantly recognizable filmmakers working today, New Zealand director Taika Waititi continues to work off the foundation of coming of age stories his been working from since his under-seen Boyand his breakout success The Hunt for the Wilderpeople with one of this award's seasons most original offerings, Jojo Rabbit.Adapted and changed quite substantially from Christine Leunens novel, Rabbit is one of the darkest coming of age comedies to come our way in some time as Waititi tells the story of Roman Griffin Davis young German boy nicknamed Jojo who is in deep with the Nazi machine and even more so with his imaginary best friend that just so happens to be Adolf Hitler.As usual Waititi isn't afraid to tackle some heavy subject matters and Rabbit is filled to the brim with some unfortunately jarring moments where you're in a surreal situation one minute then a seriously harsh/depressing one the next, meaning his newest outing is often the victim of a tone and pace that doesn't always gel.It's not to say Rabbit isn't a high quality film, Waititi as we've come to expect knows his way around an impressive set piece and shot set-up and Rabbit looks fantastic throughout as we follow Jojo on his adventure and his script work is wonderfully played out by an all-star cast including a scene stealing Sam Rockwell and some above average work by Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie and Rebel Wilson as keen Nazi Fraulein Rahm.Moving along at a brisk pace, that at times would've benefited from a little more composure, Waititi and his able gang of superstars are often overshadowed by a breakout performance from Davis who excels as Jojo, while his partner in crime Thomasin McKenzie as Jewish hideaway Elsa is as good as she was in her lauded turn in Leave No Trace.It could be argued that Waititi is the best director of children and teenagers working today, with Rabbit further establishing the filmmaker in this area as his young performers impressively navigate a narrative that takes it's audience on an increasingly intense ride that morphs further into dramatic territory as its buffoonery gives way to a fairly confronting end game, one that shows us once more that the World War 2 era still has many stories yet to tell.Despite all its wins and successful plays, you can't help but feel as though this audience pleasing favourite doesn't quite reach it's full potential even if on current form it appears as though Waititi is incapable of making a genuinely poor film.Final Say -Eminently watchable and filled with some great individual scenes and performances, Jojo Rabbit is another solid entry into the Taika Waititi filmography but one that is unlikely to end up ranking amongst one of his best as it tries to please too many genre masters.3 1/2 carelessly thrown grenades out of 5"
JOJO RABBIT,26 May 2020,6/10,"Seeing an overly amount of praise from reviews claiming how funny the film is. It is a satire but as was watching, did not find much overly funny. A few chuckles far in between but nothing laugh out laugh. The jokes were understandable but as a film the comedy isn't nearly as great as some fans are clamouring about.The film does start off with a comedy tone and has some clever humor than shifts towards the last half and becomes fat serious and dramatic- around when Scarlett Johansson's character departs.The acting is good, the visuals and outfits are well done. The story starts off strong then becomes quite repetitive and not as engaging.The best scenes involved Jojo and Hitler interacting with one another. Also the scenes with Scarlett Johansson. Although her exit was towards the second act- feeling as if it was too soon and abruptly. Sam Rockwell's performance was very solid and noteworthy as well.In the end, if the intentions of this film was to create a laugh out laugh comedy satire or a deep serious drama, some complications come in between as it isn't exactly either.Jojo Rabbit is a decent film but is coming across as overrated from the general audience whom have seen it. Not as good as advertised."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,8/10,"The movie started in a lighter note, with more comedy than war, and it escalated into a tragic drama about a young boy who has his whole world shaken by the war. The performances are perfect, the drama is enough to get you emotional, yet to feel good about the joys of life. Worth watching."
JOJO RABBIT,1 September 2020,6/10,"Review:
If it wasn't for the brilliant acting from Roman Griffin Davis, who plays Jojo Rabbit, this film wouldn't have worked. He really did make this film a joy to watch, but the storyline was a bit warped. I know that it is supposed to be a black comedy and that you're not to take it seriously, but it's hard not to be offended by some of the scenes. It felt a bit claustrophobic because most of the scenes are set in a house, with Jojo Rabbit in every scene, and with the subject matter based on Nazi Germany, I was hoping for some moments that would lighten the mood. With that aside, you can't fault it for originality, with some great performances from Scarlett Johansson (Rosie), Sam Rockwell (Captain Klenzendorf) and the girl in the cupboard, Thomasin McKenzie (Elsa). The chemistry between Jojo and his mother, Rosie, was excellent, and quite emotional in parts, and the last scene with Jojo and Captain Klenzendorf was brilliant, but I did find Adolf's (Taika Waititi) scenes a bit too much. It had a Wes Anderson/Coen Brothers feel, where you don't know if to laugh or cry, which is why I can see it not being everyone's cup of tea. If you put aside the subject matter, you should definitely watch it for the performance from Roman (Jojo), and if you can stomach this type of humour, then I wouldn't be surprised if you thought that this was a touch of genius. I'm in two minds about the film because, in one way, I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters and the way that a Jojo carried himself, but in another way, I found it all bit much to take in at once. Anyway, I have to rate Taika Waititi for pushing the barriers to the limit, even though it will make some people feel uncomfortable, and for taking a chance on the little boy, who was fantastic throughout. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Taika Waititi, who also brought you Eagle vs. Shark in 2007, Boy, What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and the brilliant Thor: Ragnarok, which changed the direction of Marvel. He currently has 8 films in development, which include Time Bandits (TV series), Akira, Oompa-Loompas (TV series), Thor: Love & Thunder, and an untitled Star Wars movie, which sounds promising. His unique style of directing has got the Hollywood big-wigs excited, which has put him in high demand. The best Mandalorian episode was the final episode, which he directed, so I'm not surprised that he was scooped up to direct a project in the Star Wars franchise. He won an Oscar and BAFTA for Best Adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, which is quite ironic because he is Maori/Jewish, playing the role of Adolf Hitler. If there was an award for the best young actor, Roman Griffin Davis (Jojo) would have won them all because this film wouldn't have been the same without him.Budget: $14million
Worldwide Gross: $90millionGenre: Comedy, Drama, War

JOJO RABBIT,20 April 2020,7/10,"Short Review :-Watched Jojo Rabbit (2019)A funny take on serious idea turns into a thoughtful satire. Well, we all know the results of Hitler's cruelty and Nazi who were obeying his order forgetting basic moral like humanity and Jojo Rabbit focuses the same issue but like I said we know the results hence film couldn't overtake it's predictability. Jojo is 10 years old lad who feels proud being a Nazi and want to crush all Jews but how would be the scenario when he falls in love with a Jew girl? Okay, i loved this idea and the funny theme also worked because intensity was low, light moments were in enough numbers. The best thing happened in the film is, the entire script comes from a little boy's point of view which is interesting. Also it is harmful because everyone around the boy has to be like him i mean less intelligent and cute. Jojo Rabbit falters because of it's predictability and irrelevant observation of Jojo's Character. However, his cuteness and thoughts made it look a really good film. After all Jojo and his friend Yorki were the cutest things in the film. Acting of Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie impresses whereas on sad note Scarlett Johansson and Taika Waititi doesn't get much do with their characters. I personally feel, Taika Waititi could have made it more impactful and more intellectul because the topic needs such thinking especially when you're adapting something you need to make it better. Rather than a good film, i would say it was a good attempt.Rating- 7/10*"
JOJO RABBIT,22 August 2020,8/10,"A unique piece of genius.
After watching the trailer I have to admit I was a little skeptical. However those doubts were quickly cast aside.
An entertaining classic that offers something to everyone."
JOJO RABBIT,1 August 2020,9/10,"A visual & emotional delight, full of LOL moments & deep humanity, that relishes in both the heartbreak & hilarious absurdity of bigotry. It reminds us that even the worst atrocities in history were committed by everyday people, & that the ultimate enemy is rarely the individual. When we realize this, coloring all racism as mustache-twirling villainy isn't so easy; we must search for our own self-justified prejudices. May we all murder the invisible Hitlers who burrow their way into our minds."
JOJO RABBIT,21 October 2019,7/10,When its funny it is really funny but at more serious moments it falls little and it makes them unnecesery but waititi helps it with his great potreyal of hitler
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,7/10,"On the whole, I feel positively about ""Jojo Rabbit"", though I do accept and can see the reasons why some people might not enjoy it.As the WW2 turns against the Germans, young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a committed if incapable member of the Hitler Youth, discovers that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish Girl in her attic. Torn between his desire to be a good Nazi and to not get his mother in trouble, Jojo's life is complicated further by his imaginary friend, the Furher himself (Taika Waititi) who tells him that Jews cannot be trusted.So, the positives first. Roman Davis is great and his relationships with all the other characters is spot on. The film is gently funny, rather than a laugh riot, which is absolutely the right call and helps make the shifts to tragedy less jarring than they otherwise might be. The do still resonate though. Despite being a focus for the films marketing, Jojo's relationship with Hitler is actually a relatively minor part of the film, it could even have been dropped altogether without losing much, maybe just a little clarity on Jojo's thinking about his guest.I don't see what there is to find offensive, the film is clearly meant to be a parody and is patently absurd for most of its runtime.So why not a perfect review?It is, for my money, a little heavy handed with its story, each committed Nazi is ridiculous, in their own way. A few aspects of the farce wear a little thin, as the show goes on. Sam Rockwell's battle armour, for example, just doesn't tie in with the character we've seen leading up to it. It also doesn't really have anything new to say. Innocence being the first casualty of war is a long acknowledged idea.That said, I enjoyed the experience."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,2/10,"If you think Nazis are funny, you might like this film.
If you think using music like Tom Waits and German versions of Beatles songs to make Nazi's cool is acceptable, you will likely love this movie.I didnt connect.Plus Johansen is a horrible actress."
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,7/10,"Jojo Rabbit must not have been an easy movie to sell. A movie featuring a Hitler youth boy in the last days of World War Two, with an actual Adolf Hitler as his imaginary friend. Sure, it's a satire, obviously, but even still... how do you get stuff like this green-lit?Well, being Taika Waititi, one of the most unorthodox directors currently working, must have helped. Especially when he himself wanted to play the role of Hitler. And I must say, the film works rather well. It's able to make you laugh big time, while also telling a heart-wrenching story about the struggle of Jews and those wanting to help them during the Third Reich. To a certain point, but let's but that aside for a moment.Because I want to praise the actors. Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl, does a great job as someone terrified out of her soul, but unwilling to show it, while Roman Griffin Davis shines as Jojo himself. I especially enjoy how clearly he changes throughout the course of the film, learning to see the world for what it is and not what he wants it to be. But the MVP award for this movie has to go to Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. What a character! Full of lust and zest for life, as well as smiling maturity. Every scene she's in, especially when she's just talking to Jojo, I could watch forever.All that being said, I did find myself struggling with the film when it came to mood swings. Whenever the film wants to be funny, it's funny enough. Whenever it wants to crush your soul under an iron boot, it does just that. It's only that these two aspects of the film have a hard time meeting. I found myself choking up because of a certain scene and then I'm expected to chuckle in the next scene.And I'm not sure how you would go about fixing that. Perhaps if the humour had been even more absurd than it is? There are a few scene that go way over the line to absurdity, like Hitler eating a boiled unicorn head, but most of the time the humour is rather grim and/or dry. Then again, had the humour been more absurd, it might have cut tension from the truly dark scenes.It's a movie I appreciated, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it. Or more accurately, I enjoyed every single scene on its own, but not necessarily together. Make of that what you will."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,6/10,"This 2019 comedy-drama takes place during Word War II and features a young, German boy, Johannes aka Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) who wants to be a Nazi soldier. Soon, he finds a young, Jewish girl, Elsa, (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in his house and his allegiance is tested as he gets to know her. Scarlett Johannson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and director, Taika Waititi are also featured. This is a pretty good flick with some dramatic & humorous moments plus a great cast I recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,8/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Jojo. As the movie opens, 10 yr. old Jojo is pledging allegiance to his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler, while we also get clips of Hitler-mania in Germany, as the Beatles' Komm Gib Mir Deiner Hand plays along. Jojo joins the Hitler Jugend traning camp in what we learn are the waning months of the Third Reich. Returning from camp, Jojo is startled to learn that a Jewish girl, Elsa, is hiding in the attic, helped by Jojo's mom. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest work from New Zealander Taika Waititi, who recently directed ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and before that the excellent ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"". Here Waititi not only directs, but also wrote the scrip, produces, AND stars as the wacky Adolf Hitler (as imagined in the mind of a 10 yr. old boy). There is lots of humor, mostly of the absurd if not black kind, but along the way plenty of points are made as well about intolerance and hate and the absurdity of war. British newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is nothing short of sensational as the young boy. His mom is played by Scarlett Johansson. Australian actress Thomasin McKenzie, outstanding in ""Leave No Trace"" is excellent as the Jewish teenager Else. Surely we have not seen the last of her (or of Davis). There are excellent song placements in the movie, including Love's ""Everybody's Gotta Live"", Roy Orbinson's ""Mama"" and David Bowie's ""Helden"", which plays in the very last scene of the movie and then over the end titles.""Jojo Rabbit"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September to positive buss. After being released in NY and LA, the movie gradually rolled out to other cities and it made its way to Cincinnati last weekend. I finally got around to seeing it this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very well, a bit to my surprise as this is NOT a very ""mainstream""-like movie. If you are in the mood to check out a new perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany with a heavy dose of absurd and black humor, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,4/10,"Writer/Director Taika Waititi is not the first filmmaker to use farce to satirize the Third Reich. In 1940, Charlie Chaplin attempted to mock the Nazis in his first full sound film, The Great Dictator. After the war, Chaplin was quoted as saying that had he known about Hitler's program of genocide, he would never have made The Great Dictator.
Chaplin implicitly recognized later on, that turning Hitler into a buffoon was not the proper strategy to expose the Nazis for what they were. It was a cheap strategy in which viewers reveled in the Nazis' comeuppance ex post facto (the buffoon being the perfect straw man-easily punctured like a papier-mâché piñata). The sad reality is, of course, that aside from their ultimate defeat, the Nazis were successful in bringing misery to a vast number of their victims.
Here Waititi employs the same strategy in having Hitler (played by Waititi himself) become the imaginary playmate of his protagonist, ten year old Johannes ""Jojo"" Beltzer (Roman Griffin Davis), an aspiring member of the Hitler Youth. There's nothing wrong with the concept of having a ten year old German boy in the waning days of World War II, having Hitler as an imaginary friend. But wouldn't it have been a much darker (and perhaps a much more accurate portrait) to have Hitler be more manipulative and seductive?
So when Jojo refuses to kill the rabbit while ensconced at the Hitler Youth camp, Hitler pretends to sympathize with Jojo as he does in the film. But later (as an alternate scenario), through his persuasive powers, he convinces the boy to change his mind, and make it seem like, ""yes, it's okay to go ahead and kill the rabbit."" That would be much more in line with the way many of these kids turned out under the spell of a Svengali like Hitler.
But as is the case with many European post-war filmmakers (and especially German ones), there always has to be at least one ""good German,"" to balance out the horror of the Nazi characters (if you're German, the plaintive cry that ""not all of us were and are bad"" must be ubiquitous). It's a noble sentiment but sometimes leads to the wrong impression that Nazi perfidy wasn't as widespread or perhaps there was ALWAYS a significant counterbalance of good Germans, who were ever present to ""do the right thing"" (i.e. opposing the genocidal madness of fanatical adherents of the Nazi regime).
So not only does Waititi promote Jojo as one of his good Germans who turned out to be good (and not one of those fanatical Hitler Youth who fought in the streets of Berlin to the very end), but there's also the one-eyed Wehrmacht Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), another buffoon of a character, who ends up sticking up for the Jews, thwarting the Gestapo and saving Jojo from certain execution by the Russians, after they emerge triumphant against the Nazis.
And Waititi insists on introducing some more ""good Germans"" (this time much closer to home) in the form of Jojo's mom, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson ), who has been hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in a secret room throughout the war. It's all part of Waititi's strategy to promote a pyrrhic victory-the good guys facilitate their comeuppance against the bumbling Nazis.
Elsa, in particular, turns out to be a virtual super girl-convincing Jojo of the error of his belief in the ""Master Race"" and outwitting the Gestapo in the crucial ""dark moment"" at the end of the second act. There are no truly fleshed out characters in Jojo Rabbit-only those designed to protect the audience from grasping the true nature of Nazism and reducing them to ordinary, clownish villains in Waititi's generic ""anti-hate"" campaign.
On the other hand, when Waititi eschews turning his Nazis into perennial clowns, he's more successful (and makes one feel he's getting at ""something""). There are ""glimpses"" throughout Jojo Rabbit of the darker side. I'm thinking of scenes such as when Jojo's fellow Hitler Youth kill the rabbit, or when we see Jojo's drawings of the repulsive caricatures of Jews in his notebook or the aftermath of the murder of Rosie, hung in the streets after being outed as a collaborator with the resistance.
Waititi's most revolutionary gesture is the politically incorrect way in which he depicts the anti-Semitism of ordinary Germans. Even the goodly Jojo is infected by the scourge of ""Jew hatred."" While we never see any fanatic Nazis talking about extermination, the banality of such ordinary ""shop talk"" is indicative of the kind of racism inculcated in the minds of those who indulged in what Hannah Arendt termed ""the banality of evil.""
In the end, however, Waititi serves up a predictable happy ending, again promoting the comeuppance of a group who in reality were the victors in the game of genocidal madness (in reality did Hitler get his just desserts?-not really...he killed himself in the bunker but was responsible for murdering millions).
For those kids who went to their death as committed Nazis, the rest of the remnants of the Hitler Youth (like Jojo) who underwent de-Nazification, did not emerge ""dancing in the streets"" upon liberation (in contrast to the happy Jojo and Elsa). Indeed, it took these kids years to overcome the horrific conditioning imposed upon them by legions of brutal taskmasters-hardly a group of certified buffoons."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,7/10,"'Jojo Rabbit' is a really odd little film when you think about it. It's a satirical comedy about one of the most serious and dark times in human history. And yet somehow Taika Waititi manages to make it work. Now don't think that just because I'm a fellow New Zealander I will give Waititi a free pass on all his films. He's proving himself to be a very fine film-maker, but I'm far from his biggest fan. This film is almost impossible to hate though. If directing is considered to be Waititi's biggest strength, then his acting can't be far behind. He has incredible comedic timing and it is on full display in 'Jojo Rabbit'. Every scene he appears in is an absolute treat.The film has been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in a few days time. It deserves its nomination (I mean if you make a film about WW2 then you're about a 50% chance of getting nominated from the get go these days) but I can't see it managing to get the win. It just doesn't feel like the type of film that will appeal to quite enough voters to get over the line. Scarlett Johansson has also been nominated for Actress in a Supporting Role. This is incredibly her second acting nomination in the same year, combining with a Lead Role nomination for 'Marriage Story'. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category, but her performance here is admittedly great. She has a limted time to make us fall in love with and care for her character, and she achieves it and then some. A lot of years she would be a serious chance of taking home the award, but I feel that her 'Marriage Story' co-star Laura Dern will be too strong this year.The cast of this movie is amazing. It would take me too long to list all the great actors they managed to get on-board for this project. None of the them are a let down either. They all are perfectly cast and play to their strengths exquisitely. The thing about this film is that it is often so light-hearted and funny that when something serious happens it really takes you off-guard and hits you hard. You are suddenly jolted back into the reality that you are watching a Nazi war film. I had a good time with 'Jojo Rabbit'. It was about what I expected in relation to tone and I felt it worked well. It's worth a look."
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2019,7/10,"Hilarious and dramatic. It's a funny movie with some dark moments. Overall it makes for a spectacular movie. The dude who directed Thor: Raganrok knows how to make a comedy with a little darkness to it. It's a fun movie about a boy trying to fit in with what was going on in Germany during the Tail end of WWII and just when it gets to light we get hit with so that that brings it all home in too real of a matter.
It's a great film because it gets out all those feelings that only a great piece of art can."
JOJO RABBIT,15 June 2021,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit (2019) is a movie my fiancee and I grabbed from Redbox one inauspicious day. The storyline surrounds a young man and his mother trying to hide their discourse from the Nazi's that they don't believe in their efforts and strategy. Their beliefs put their life's at risk every day so they need to create their own world of happiness and adventure. This movie is directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) and stars Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2), Roman Griffin Davis (Silent Night) and Rebel Wilson (Bride's Maids). The storyline for this has everything - drama, comedy, action, coming of age elements, the challenge of being a parent and everything in between. The casting and acting is remarkably good. The writing is also very unique, witty and clever. How the storyline unfolds and the ultimate conclusion is triumphant and heart wrenching at the same time. This really is a masterpiece that I strongly recommend. Love this movie and would easily score it a 10/10."
JOJO RABBIT,1 June 2021,9/10,"Towards the end of the war in Europe, young Jojo Betzler (an excellent Roman Griffin Davis) joins the Hitler Youth in preparation for the final defense of the Fatherland, an act fully supported by his imaginary friend, an affable (at least initially), anachronistic Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Slowly the young boy learns of the horrors that the disintegrating Nazi regime has inflicted on Germany as he befriends a young Jewish girl, much to the horror of his virtual Führer-friend. The well-executed condemnation of fascism is an extreme blend of broad, almost farcical comedy and poignant, almost tragic, drama, and the reciprocal trajectories of imaginary Adolf's behaviour and personality and Jojo's growing disillusionment with ""Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer"" are very clever (Waititi's costumes mirror Hitler's uniforms from the early days of the party to the fall of the Berlin). The cast is uniformly excellent (I particularly liked Archie Yates as Jojo's rotund Hitlerjugend pal Yorki) and the recreation of the last moments of the war in Germany is detailed and accurate (despite the fanciful flavour). Definitely a film that really takes off once you 'get the joke' and one that benefits from close scrutiny (or from reading trivia entries by people who did)."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,9/10,"Although its pace is versatile, depending on dialogues and scenes, I find it wise that the beginning is so ""crazy"" - it makes you eagerly follow what is going on and what would happen, enjoy the twists and changes in moods and wisenings even more... A real dramedy, with sad and tragic moments included.The performances are excelling, particularly the 2 ""leading boys"" Jojo and Yorki, as well the supporting cast... Direction, production, music - everything in harmony, just where they need to be.Well, evidently, such a film could not have been made in Germany, but still - good that we have it. Forget your prejudices, discomfort and one-sided stories about WWII and see comic elements in tragedy and vice versa!"
JOJO RABBIT,30 March 2020,,"In the latter days of the Third Reich with growing disillusionment setting in due to the pending outcome of WWII, a jingoistic ten-year-old boy reaches a milestone as he prepares to join his first Hitler Youth training camp. Though certain of his loyalty, he makes a shocking discovery that calls his entire belief system into question. Film's content is risky, but director Waititi (also appearing onscreen as a tongue-in-cheek caricature of The Führer himself) treads carefully to inject subversive humor that preaches against the same hateful vitriol that the regime inspired. Witty, outlandish, and irreverent, but loses a lot of steam after a strong start, and despite some dramatic turns in the third act it lacks a really strong, convincing conclusion to wrap things up. Well-acted, with incredible work from Davis in the central role, quality support from Johansson as his conflicted but fiercely protective mother, and an unselfconscious Rockwell as a bumbling camp commandant, but the parts are greater than the whole in this bold attempt to satirize Nazi Germany. **½"
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,10/10,"10/10 - stunning twist on the traditional WWII flick with beautiful scenery, story, and characters"
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,6/10,"I saw ""Jojo Rabbit"", starring Roman Griffin Davis-in his first movie; Scarlett Johansson-the Avengers movies, Eight Legged Freaks; Sam Rockwell-Vice, Cowboys & Aliens and Taika Waititi-What We Do in the Shadows, Green Lantern.
This is a quirky dark comedy about WW2. Roman plays a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany during WW2 that is in a Hitler youth camp-they train children to become Nazi soldiers. Sam plays one of the teachers that instills hatred of the Jewish persuasion into their young naive minds. Things such as that Jews have magic powers, can control minds, hang from the ceiling like bats to sleep, etc. Scarlett plays Roman's mother, who does not share those beliefs. In fact, Scarlett gives refuge to a Jewish girl by hiding her in the attic but she doesn't tell Roman because of his schooling, so when he finds her hiding place, there is a dilemma. Should he turn her in, like a good Nazi? Or if he does, will his mother get in trouble for hiding her? Taika plays Roman's imaginary friend that Roman talks to for advice-no one else can see Hitler. FYI: Taika also wrote and directed the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for disturbing images, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you like quirky, then it would be a good rental."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,9/10,". . . in these Politically Correct Times, the job of reviewing JOJO RABBIT becomes particularly problematic. (It's akin to discussing a fair & balanced NBA without bringing up the ""B-Word,"" or praising Hollywood's meritocracy with no allusions to the thousands of ""W-Word"" household names.) Just as one can see the good on each side by remembering that ""Milky Way"" refers to BOTH stars and candy bars, JOJO RABBIT and THE PRODUCERS (musical version) are two peas in a pod, featuring a hilarious H-Word. (To reduce this continuing awkwardness, from here on I'll substitute ""Hipster"" for the H-Word.) I still think that THE PRODUCERS' Fuhrer if far funnier than JOJO RABBIT's. There is no gut-busting moment in the latter flick to compare with the earlier film's ""Springtime for Hipster (and Germany)"" dance routine. JOJO RABBIT's bunny trail slopes steadily downhill, winding up as much of a morbid downer as LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. The glaring casting mistake which finds Confederate Wilson playing a Flatulent Fraulein here is akin to such an egregious error as installing Divine as the title character of THE GODFATHER would have been. For the best, then, in Hipster Humor, you cannot go wrong in streaming THE PRODUCERS!"
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2020,5/10,"Ten year old Jojo Rabbit (Roman Griffin Davis) can't tie his shoes and is uneasy around roughhousing but he has a burning desire to serve his Fuhrer. When he finds out his mother (Scarlett Johansen) is a harboring a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) it throws his childish principles into disarray. Having already adopted Hitler as an imaginary pal he struggles with his dual loyalty between mom and monster.Jojo is pure SS (sober and silly), its split personality failing to jell cogently, the dark moments hackneyed amid raucous slapstick and heavy handed caricatures save for Sam Rockwell's cynically comic German officer, dead ender.The Hitler/Harvey hybrid gimmick works for all of five minutes before losing its edge and director Taika Waititi, for some reason bathing his film in green does not help matters by casting himself in the role. Johansen and McKenzie display adequate melancholy while Davis as Jojo is impressive in the lead, recalling Oskar from Volker Schlondorff's superb The Tin Drum (79), a far more accomplished film on the topic featuring a similar character. With its mood swings and hipster incidentals Jojo Rabbit remains too detached playing with itself to invest any emotion in."
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,9/10,"Alternating between bitter poignance and flippant hilarity, Jojo Rabbit thrives as an emotional rollercoaster. Gravely serious situations are often cut with a well-timed, stress-melting laugh. Light moments of childish infatuation take a sudden swerve into existential turmoil. That's a hallmark of director Taika Waititi, who explored similarly polarizing contrasts in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and, as it turns out, it's also the essence of childhood during wartime.Here we spend time with a ten-year-old German boy (passionately interested in the fading Third Reich), his troubled but deeply caring mother, the comically inept Nazis left to supervise their small town, and the sarcastic Jewish girl secreted away in their attic. Largely due to circumstance, the kids deal with some very adult subjects, trying everything to convince their peers to take them seriously. It doesn't work, of course, and that leads to some of the richest comedy, so they redouble their efforts. It's only in the very last scene, with the shadow of impending invasion finally past, that the specter of assumed adulthood is released and we finally catch a glimpse of these children acting their age. I wasn't sure the film would actually come together until that perfect moment, but what rich rewards for a thoroughly up-and-down journey.Whimsical but honest, colorful but draining, it's both wonderful and terrible, often at the same time. My spine was shivering as it cut to the credits."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,8/10,"A brilliant film, excellent acting and script, a far more layered film than one might expect. Incredibly moving yet hilarious. A fantastic black comedy that digs deep at the idiocy of the Nazi movement."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,9/10,"The first film I have seen in 2020 is Jojo Rabbit, a film that has been predicted to do incredibly well at the Oscars this year so I was intrigued to watch this film and I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. The premise of the movie sees a young Nazi trying to find his place when he comes across a Jewish Girl.Main Character
Roman Griffith Davis is a young child actor and this is the first film I have seen him in but I don't think it will be the last in this film as he is truly fantastic in this film. His character Jojo goes through a really emotional journey throughout the film and you end up really caring about this character even though he is a Nazi. This is literally one of the best child performances in recent memory and I am curious how much recognition he will get and when we will see him next.Supporting Characters
This film has a really impressive supporting cast and first to Taika Waititi who is also the Director of this movie, he plays Adolf Hitler in this film and is Davis's imaginery friend in the film. He is brilliant in this film and delivers a great over the top performance that provides some really funny moments in this film. He and Davis have really great chemistry in the film and really provide some stand out moments in the film. Scarlett Johansson plays Jojo's mother in the film and she also delivers a good performance, she plays the loving mother very well and you believe in her relationship with Jojo. Her character has a bit of mystery to it but that doesn't get enough time to fully invest you but she is a good character in this film. Thomasin Mckenzie plays the Jewish Girl in this film and her and Davis's chemistry is very good and their development is the emotional crux in the movie so in order for you to believe in this film you have to care about their story. Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen & Rebel Wilson are also really funny in this film and give good performances.Story
This film was pretty much marketed as a comedy so I was curious how the story was going to be but it was pretty good. As mentioned the relationship between Davis & Mckenzie's characters is the part that invested me and made me care about the these characters and the story that they go through in the film. However, I feel like the story wasn't as strong as it could have been, there are certain elements of the story involving other characters that don't get enough time for you to really care about them, and with the film being only around 1 Hour 40 Minutes there could have been time for this.Script
This film does focus on the humourous side and does an excellent job. If you like darker humour this film is definitley for you. Waititi especially provides tons of laughs and after his performance as Korg in Thor Ragnarok, he truly is built for really funny supporting roles. The drama though is suprisngly very good, you really will care about these characters and the plight that they are in, especiallly as the film comes towards its conclusion.Style
This film is a very funny film, it knows when to take itself seriously though and does a really good job of finding the balance between the two types of tone where it doesn't take away from each other. It deals with the subject matter in a really fun way and this film has a very unique feeling which gives it extra poimts in my opinion.Overall
This in my opinion is a fantastic film that really made me laugh and gave me a real fun time in the cinema. If you like films with dark humour this is a film for you and even if you aren't this film could be for you and you should give it a chance."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,5/10,"I think I might like this film a little better if the jokes landed stronger. The humor is never cringe inducing but most of it never arises above dryly amusing. The best joke in the entire film is a dumb pun about German Shepherds and that is a sort of a big problem with the film. Farces like this require the material to be taken nearly on the subtextual level and JoJo Rabbit never properly gets there. The rest of the writing is too loose to be effective.The film is way too saccharine on the possibility of change for people. JoJo's (character) entire story is a maturation plot mixed with a redemption plot. He stops being a Nazis because he grows up and meets a Jewish girl. The film stacks the deck in his favor to change. He's young. He finds the Jewish girl cute. The plot developments how Nazism treats his family all grease the wheels to get him to change. As far as that goes it's fine. It is keeping with the film's overall style and taken as farce it lands. But the film doesn't stop there.Much of the problem stems from Captain Klenzendorf. Played by Hollywood's go to for a likable bigot, Sam Rockwell, this character's story needed to be removed or vastly re-written. He is given a fairly similar arch to JoJo. But his arch is truncated to the point it is unbelievable and worse undermines the uniqueness of JoJo's escape from Nazism. When viewed in context this character makes the film too sunny. Most people do not escape their ideological trappings. (There is also a weird queering of Klenzendorf to try to sell the change as he too was a victim of the Nazis but that rises other issues).The film isn't in bad taste. It just has a blinkered and naive view of human nature."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,8/10,"Griffin Davis plays a confused member of the Nazi youth guided through his life by an imaginary Hitler played by Taika Waititi. His views and life are challenged when he discovers that his mother (Johansson) has been keeping a young Jewish girl hidden in their house.Really difficult to pin this one down. It could have so easily been unfunny, even extremely tasteless. What it in fact delivers is an often hilarious comedy with some supremely touching even harrowing scenes. Waititi's script is hysterical with many glorious one liners delivered by a particularly fine cast. Johansson has rarely been better and is totally convincing as the loving German mother, whilst young Griffin Davis gives the best child actor turn since Jacob Tremblay in Room. The supporting cast are also integral to the humour with Rockwell fine as the German captain who likes the strange boy, Merchant hilarious and sinister as the local Gestapo head and best of all Archie Yates as the boy's best friend.Not for everyone to be sure, but a terrific film destined for cult following."
JOJO RABBIT,14 July 2021,8/10,"Jojo Rabit is a comedy drama movie directed by Taika Waititi and stars Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlet Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and Alfie Allen.Jojo Rabit is a greatest movie in it's own. A superb satirical take on the mind wash done to the kids with Nazi rhetoric. The film also displays a beautiful bond between a mother and a son and the bond of trust and care between two individuals with different ideologies.Acting is superb and Roman Griffin Davis is being the most shining star of them. He is perfect in his acting and portrayed the role with utmost perfection. Thomasin McKenzie was equally impressive. Taika Waititi in the character of Hitler was hilariously great. Scarlet Johansson and other cast were impressive.Screenplay is good and had displayed a very sensitive subject in a very humorous way. The screenplay might gets slow in between but will never disappoints. The climax of the movie is predictable but good.A decent entertaining movie and a good satirical take on Hitler and his atrocities done to children by brainwashing them. A must watch."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,6/10,This was entertaining but the subject matter was not easy to laugh at.
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,10/10,"There is very little in the world that you can't turn into something humorous. Don't get me wrong, there are a few items I won't mention. But back in 1967 director/writer Mel Brooks showed that even Hitler and the Nazis could be funny with ""Springtime for Hitler"" in his film THE PRODUCERS. Now director writer Taika Waititi uses the same setting, Nazi Germany, for a darkly humorous and troubling film called JOJO RABBIT.Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten year old boy living in Nazi Germany during the final years of the war. Like all good young German children, Jojo is part of the Hitler youth and excited about his trip to camp with the group where they will learn things like killing, bombing and hand to hand combat. He and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) can't wait to get there.Things aren't quite what he expected once there. Certainly all the items promised are delivered by camp commandant Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a German officer who's been assigned here after a mishap during his last command. He goes about his day half interested with his flash nearby and with the aid of the more destructive Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) providing help.But things change when Jojo refuses to kill a rabbit just to show he is willing to kill. From this he gets the nickname Jojo Rabbit. Talking to his best invisible friend, the leader himself Adolph Hitler (Waititi) he convinces himself to show his bravery, runs up taking a grenade from Klenzendorf's hand during training and throws it only to have it bounce off a tree and land next to him. This results in injury and scarring and Jojo is sent home.This is all fine with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Rosie dotes on her son and allows him his daydreams of fighting for the Reich alongside his long gone father. One day while she's out Jojo hears a noise upstairs. Investigating he finds a young girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in a secret room off of his deceased sister's bedroom. Frightened at first it doesn't take long for him to realize that this girl is a Jew and has been hidden her by his mother.Being a loyal Nazi what does he do? Does he turn her in? Or does he allow his love for his mother to override his duty? To decide what to do he converses with his imaginary best friend who suggests that he use her to gain information. He sets out to write a book about Jews that he can then present to the Fuhrer himself.From here we are transported into both the worlds of Jojo's imagination in his discussions with his imaginary friend and the harsh reality of the world that surrounds him. The moments with Hitler are the funniest parts of the film, with him acting un-Hitler like and offering more comedy than inducing fear. But there are scenes of Jojo walking with his mother through town where a make shift scaffold has been set up in the town square with Jews hung there in public for all to see. It is this back and forth of the sadness and terror of war set beside things like the humor in Jojo's beliefs of Jews as being horned devils that makes the film strange while at the same time making it work.To bring a film like this to life takes the efforts of all involved. Waititi has done a fantastic job with the handling of the story, earning an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. His direction here shows why he's an up and coming force to be reckoned with, able to handle things like his previous dark comedy WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS to the super powered Marvel film THOR: RAGNAROK. His performance as Hitler here strikes all the right notes making him the funniest character in the film.The movie would have fallen on its face had they not found the perfect young actor for the lead role. Davis is just that actor, making Jojo the most sympathetic character here rather than the monster he could have been as a Hitler youth. McKenzie brings to her character a subtle touch of fear while at the same time being a strong character at the same time. And Johansson shows why she's a much better actress than folks give her credit for. She's more than a spandex wearing superhero which is what most associate her with. She carries her own here with a character that you care for as much as Jojo does.It's a difficult mix to combine the horrors of war with comedy and not easily done. Waititi has done so here with moments that are hilarious but frightening at the same time. It tackles a subject from a viewpoint no one has before and while doing so provides a strong stance against violence. War isn't something to be taken lightly and the fact that children were propagandized like this should be a scary thought to consider. But perhaps, as with Jojo, they can come to realize not everything they're told is true."
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,8/10,"From the opening scene, this film had me excited. Its so much fun all the way through. Even some extremely intense scenes can also be filled with some excellent humour. Taika sure knows how to direct!
Our main cast is filled with excellent performances! (Sorry the app has glitched and the rest of this review is gonna have to be in bold...)
Earlier on there where a few scenes with the kids where i felt the performances were weak, but boy did it only get better!
The movie is also so well paced, with a plot which never seems to never slow down and never needs to. (I did feel the final sequence was a little drawn out, maybe a minute or so couldve been shaved off)
We also have excellent production design the whole way through the film... its full of colour and so visualy appealing!What a great film!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,,"I was expecting a shallow comedy, something like thousands of Hitler collages on YouTube."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit: How to describe this film? A serious comedy infused with elements of fantasy? It will have you laughing but the chuckles will die in your throat as you observe the final weeks of the Third Reich in a German town. Pensioners and children are armed with panzerfausts and rifles, ""traitors"" are hanged, the Gestapo hunt Jews until the very end. These could be scenes from Downfall.Ten year old Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is an ardent member of the Hitler Youth who has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). This comical Hitler hangs out with Jojo, encourages him in his efforts, comforts him when he is bullied at the Hitler Youth weekend camp. The camp is run by invalided Captain Klenzdorf (Sam Rockwell) along with his shell-shocked assistant Sub-Officer Finkel (Alfie Allen) and the crazed Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who has borne 18 Aryan babies for the Reich, a great comic trio. The bullying is by teenage HY members though and Jojo suffers injuries from a premature grenade explosion.Jojo's mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) appears to be a model Nazi but she is hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), and engaging in resistance activities. Jojo discovers Elsa's hiding place and at first his simple nazi ideology is to the fore but they gradually develop a tentative relationship. Elsa showing that she is no victim but someone whose people wrestled with angels and killed giants. Truly great performances by McKenzie and Davis.The humour ranges from a Tommy Cooper style skit where Rosie plays two parts to Mel Brookes type humour: (i) his slapstick mode where the imaginary Hitler is hamming, recoiling from a wall in case Jews are hiding in it, (ii) the serious comedy of To Be Or Not To Be when Jojo must fool the Gestapo. But these comparisons don't take away from the genius of Waititi's script, timing and direction.Writer/Director/Actor Taika Waititi has delivered a comic triumph which literally and metaphorically deposits the nazis in the dustbin of history. 9/10."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,6/10,"Here was something different. A young boy living in Nazi Germany idolizes Hitler but then falls in love with a girl hiding in his house. I didn't find this movie laugh out loud funny. I was more like thinking in my head that there were some clever moments. And one shocking one. I didn't really get that invested in it, but it did have a nice, satisfying ending."
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2020,5/10,"This film was crazy. It tried to be funny and very silly, but at the same time serious and dark. For me it did not work at all. While it was indeed funny, the comedy ruins the dark theme and spoils the atmosphere."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,8/10,One of the funniest film of the year. What started off as a comedy very smoothly amd perfectly blended into drama. Great level of seriousness and comedy mixed in with even better shots and perfect casting.
JOJO RABBIT,13 August 2020,10/10,"Last year's Best Original Screenplay Oscar went to this whimsical fantasia about a Hitler youth growing up in Germany w/his mother, played by Scarlett Johansson (who was Oscar nominated for a supporting role), during WWII. After hurting himself during a grenade throwing mishap at a youth training camp, JoJo is sent home to recuperate (after sustaining injuries to his legs & getting a distinctive facial scar for his troubles). Trying to keep himself occupied, he stumbles upon a Jewish girl (a friend of his diseased sister) living in the walls of their home (shades of Anne Frank), played by Thomasin McKenzie, which sends him into a frenzy since he is a true believer in all things Reich (he even has an imaginary friend in Hitler, played by director Taiki Waititi, that he regularly engages in conversation with). Being overpowered by her physically, he hopes to break her down on a intellectual level by pleading his case that his people are superior but as the waning days of the war come to a close, he finds common ground w/his visitor setting up a lifelong friendship which will outshine any petty conflicts mere humans happen to be engaged in. W/echoes as disparate as Catch 22, Dr. Strangelove & Life is Beautiful, JoJo enters that pantheon of smart, entertaining polemics against war which show the human condition, when flexed correctly, can supplant any hate & carnage naysayers throw at it. Co-starring Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson & Alfie Allen (from Game of Thrones) as German officers training in the homefront & Stephen Merchant as an SS officer."
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,8/10,"Comedy elements are great but drama one didn't do it for me. A lot of snowflakes will be offended by this movie and ""how it glorifies nazism"" but I'm not one of them (ok boomers). Taika Waititi is amazing as Hitler and steals every scene. I loved german version of Heroes at the end."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,9/10,"Hands down the funniest Hitler movie I've ever seen. This thing is bonkers, irreverent, crazy and yet somehow remarkably poignant and impactful. I would have never thought to laugh at outrageous Nazi-isms and be near tears in other moments. Everyone is spot on here but ScarJo really stood out to me, delivering a quirky yet lovingly maternal performance.It actually surprises me to see this is so highly rated because I would have thought this would be an incredibly divisive film. Apparently it found the sweet spot with audiences and I'm so happy about that. A definite must see."
JOJO RABBIT,23 August 2020,9/10,"It shouldn't take long to figure out this film is a satire, but of the cruelest kind: Juvenalian. I always thought Dr. Strangelove would be the satire against which all other satiric films would be judged. Now, not so sure. This film has moments of hilarity that just slap you in the face when you realize what your laughing at. Then thoses moments of cruelity are not just cruel, but cringworthy cruel. Many of us have enough knowledge of WW II to know how this will play out: we are watching an execution but can't look away. I would like to believe that watching and talking about this film might enlighten a few minds, I really would like to believe that."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,8/10,"To remind people how wars bring people suffered. Dear Trump, please don't do anything stupid and don't get mad of your enemies and no innocent should take the consequences because of your stupid behavior. Story is beautiful but too sad for a boy in a war zone."
JOJO RABBIT,17 March 2020,5/10,"I was disappointed but it had it's good moments. Scarlet Johansson is excellent in the film, but besides that, it's quite lacking. The tone is all over the place and the film is just not very enjoyable to sit through and quite awkward at times."
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,8/10,"There's no denying Jojo Rabbit is a clever piece of cinema. It takes the hysteria surrounding Nazism in Germany in WWII and subverts it, by focusing its idiocy through a lens of everyday, ""normalcy"".Hatred of Jews with absurd caricatures and rumours. Beatles like hysteria over the Fuhrer, who is idolised by the main character to the point of becoming an imaginary friend. The bizarre rituals and militarised games played by Hitler Youth are all brought into focus. Its nutty stuff and skewed from this angle, often quite funny, as insightful satire should be.That's not to say this is entirely new. Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator did it first and in a general sense, did it better. Indeed, this film does have its shortcomings. Chief of which, is its retrospective moral outrage, over the treatment of the Jews. As my mother, who lived through WWII noted years ago, ""everyone was sorry after the fact but not sorry enough at the time, to do anything meaningful about it"".Suffice to say, it would have been better, I feel, to look more into the character of the young Jewish girl hiding in the families home, presenting her as a human being first and foremost. This would have said more, than moral angst ever could.A little disappointed too to see yet more anti Russian sentiment. The Russians did not typically execute prisoners, only those found guilty of war crimes. Many did die in captivity but that happened in US and Soviet custody.That said, what this film does demonstrate in a innocently funny but also very sad way, is how Nazism effected children. Something that is often overlooked, when visiting this period of history.Suffice to say there's a lot to like here. This films funny, sad, likeable, down to earth, and a bit zany. For me a must watch.8/10."
JOJO RABBIT,3 September 2020,1/10,This film is maybe a 5.9 stars out of 10 stars at best. It is as boring as watching paint dry. And worse of all it isn't even funny! Usually IMDb is reliable but not in this case. Scores are totally off. Such a waste of my time. Awful and sleepy!
JOJO RABBIT,26 November 2019,6/10,"Taika Waititi (""Thor Ragnarok"") is an auteur who I really respect, a lot. He has an incredibly unique, soulful, and humorous sensibility which, despite walking through dark themes and imagery at times, always seems to find a settled place in hope and peace. He has been able to keep this soul throughout films about vampires, foster care, parental death, and even the MCUs ""Thor Ragnarok,"" one of the best entries into the MCU Canon.It is a rare thing when a truly unique voice is given the opportunity to make a blockbuster like Thor and even more rare that they manage to maintain their artistic integrity as they do so. Considering this, I was eager to see ""Jojo Rabbit,"" apparently the film you make after a smashingly successful first go at a major Hollywood blockbuster and the cache' that success garners you, at least, that is, if you are Taika Waititi.The concept of this film is the other half of the draw, for me and, most likely, for many people who have seen the trailer. It's a pretty wild concept to look at the fall of the German Reich from the perspective of a naive wide-eyed eager young boy who is actually a pretty big fan of Hitler and really hates Jews. As I sat down to watch this film, I had moments where I hoped I was about to see something akin to ""Death of Stalin,"" poignant and cutting satire that leaned hard into its themes, with a dash of ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" childhood antics and adulting.In this regard, the film did not disappoint. Especially, the first 30 minutes or so of ""Jojo Rabbit"" is chock full of children hurting themselves, engaging in hilarious ignorance driven misspeak, and a healthy dose of sardonic wit in which the young troop of pseudo cub scouts seem more like children being thrown into basic training and brainwashing. This section is so enjoyable, partially because of the child actors who are simply stellar throughout. The thrill of team activity and camaraderie is writ large across all of their faces even as their confusion about things 'too-grow-up' for them begin to encroach on their happy go lucky fun in the woods lifestyle.This isn't all there is to life, though, as Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is soon to learn. Although he doesn't know it, his mother (Scarlett Johannson, ""Her"") is a member of the resistance and is hiding a Jewish girl in her attic. With Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie,""The King"") we get the introduction of an Anne Frank sort of character who forces Jojo into a bit of a quandary. On the one hand, he feels like he should turn her in but he also fears the 'devious ways of the Jew"" and suspects that turning her in may end up getting him and his mother in trouble. He decides instead to dedicate himself to learning and writing about the things he learns from her as a sort of study on Jews and why they are so awful.As you can see, this film has some really interesting character complexities at play and I haven't even gotten to Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") as the Troop Leader for the kids or Jojo's little fat friend in the Hitler Youth who has some of the best lines of the film.Unfortunately, this is where I have to say that I didn't love this film. For all of its great qualities which I described above, the film left me wanting. I don't think everyone will feel this way but there is no way around the fact that this film just didn't stick the landing for me. Why? I'm not exactly sure, and I'll own that.I don't know why I didn't walk out of the theater shouting about about how much I adore this film. Maybe, the humorous and dramatic parts weren't balanced in the way that I typically like or certain sections weren't as snappy as I expected. Either way, I end up feeling that, while it is a good movie, it isn't one I expect to watch more than once more in my life, if that.However, I do think that the film has an audience out there and I sincerely hope it finds that crowd. It is full of heart and the themes of seeking understanding about those different than us, the drive for acceptance, and confronting the ugly realities of life but not losing hope are surely important ones that anyone today will see the value of. Also, if you want to see a kid shoot a bazooka by accident and react as if he just spilled the milk instead of blowing up a building, then you may need to run out and see this film."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is an incredible and powerful comedy drama that's extremely relevant, funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking. Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie and Scarlett Johansson all give incredible performances. Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant are great as well as Taika Waititi who uses his character just the right amount. Taika Waititi's direction is incredible and the soundtrack is amazing. It's well paced and consistently very funny."
JOJO RABBIT,24 November 2019,8/10,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A flawed but memorable dark satire about Nazism.JIM'S REVIEW: It so hard to make a Nazi comedy. The sheer subject of their heinous acts of brutality shown in satirical terms is off-putting from the start. Even with decades between WWII and the present day rise of white supremacy and hate crimes, the pain and cruelty is not easily forgotten, nor should it be. This is not to say that using comedy as weapon is a new approach. And now. some eighty five years later, we have Jojo Rabbit taking direct aim at the Hitler regime.Taika Waititi wrote, directed and starred in this independent film and while his intent is admirable, his execution is slightly flawed. As a director, he creates many memorable scenes with powerful images that carry with them a rare beauty and insight. At times, there is sheer brilliance in his vision, as with his opening credit sequence which mixes anachronistic lyrics of the Beatles' Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand, sung in German, with actual Nazi archival footage showing the mass hysteria of a mob mentality. But at other times, he wallows in sentimentality and the obvious targets of blundering Nazis.As a screenwriter, his coming-of-age tale about a young impressionistic Hitler youth living with his widowed mother and dealing with an imaginary friend named Adolf has an intriguing premise. He layers his narrative with bittersweet moments and comical conflict. We meet a 10 year old boy caught up in a nationalistic frenzy whose bedroom walls are covered with pro-Nazi propaganda rather than sport figures or movie idols, a telling sign. Something is amiss in Johann. He is an enigma, a child soldier who will parrot the hate speech he is carefully taught but yet sensitive enough to discover the beauty of that aforementioned solitary blue butterfly flitting through his war-torn village. But Mr. Waititi's dialog lacks substantial power, some of the comedy elements are broad slapstick and don't work, and most of his supporting characters are cliche-ridden stock types. Also, story-wise, the plot loses its logical path with a plot twist that comes unexpectedly midway through the film and has some trouble recovering from it. Still there is so much to admire due to his filmmaking skills and the fine photography by Mihai Malaimare Jr.As an actor, Mr. Waititi is effective. Yet he never captures the goofiness and comic edge of Der Fuhrer, which is a minor misstep in this pivotal role. His interpretation should have been more outlandish and farcical. He just doesn't show the menace or the charisma. His character annoys rather than enthralls. Perhaps another actor would have been a better choice and would have given him some distance in this filmmaker trifecta.However, Roman Griffin Davis in the title role is excellent. Perfectly cast, this young actor gives one of the most natural performance by a child ever filmed and his portrayal of a boy coming to terms with the insane world around him is quite moving. His expressive face conveys a child learning war games but unable to tie his own shoes. Thomasin McKenzie plays Elsa, a Jewish girl hiding in Jojo's house and she has a nice chemistry with Mr. Davis. Scarlett Johansson provides some tender moments as Rosie, Jojo's loving mother. The reliable Sam Rockwell tries to add some depth in his sketchy role as is Captain Klenzendorf, an Army officer in charge of a Hitler Youth camp, but Rebel Wilson as his assistant can't keep her German accent straight, let alone find the essence of her role. Stephen Merchant delivers the creepiness as a Gestapo agent and Archie Yates brings some wonderful comic timing as Jojo's clumsy friend, Yorki.Jojo Rabbit is another reworking of the sum of its parts being better than the whole. Nevertheless, the film remains a welcome and strong indictment to hatred with Mr. Waititi definitely a talent to watch. His film uses comedy as a lethal weapon and it lands mainly on target. This reviewer look forward to his next venture and so should any serious moviegoer.Comedy as a Weapon of Mass Destruction"
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,2/10,"My Rating : 2/10After a long time I'm seeing a boring movie so it's a real eye-opener since it's quite mainstream and has received good reviews.It's just plain boring, unfunny and has zero entertainment value."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,9/10,"LIKES:Acting

The Ending AwkwardnessThe VERDICT:Jojo rabbit is a darker comedy, but so long as you can accept this and the ridiculous nature that comes with it, then you can expect to enjoy this comedy. It's acting is on point, the emotional levels packed within are touching and entertaining, and the comedy had me laughing extremely hard at the mocking this story told. Just like Thor Ragnarok, Waititi continues to prove his skills as a director and writer, finding ways to really bring comedy into a film, but never dump other qualities that a film needs. This art form he brings is why I recommend this movie be enjoyed at the theaters, and I hope you laugh as hard as I did. However, I'll warn people that the darker comedies, and focus on the evils of Nazi history may be too much for some audience members, so consider this before buying a ticket. Overall, this movie was a hoot and I implore people see it and have fun at the treasure trove of comedy that lies within.My scores are:Comedy/Drama/War: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,7/10,"Every war film, even subversive comedies about 'Hitler Youth', contains some heroic action by the American forces (even if they were not there). At the end of the movie which concerns the 'Invasion of Berlin', it looks as if they were fighting hand in hand with the Russians, which kind of ruined the story a bit (did they not show up two months later!?). The rest of the movie is funny, moving and suitably disturbing (in places). I really loved the cast of actors though not too keen on the obese kid with glasses. The stated character would never have been part of this regiment of child soldiers. I think belief in cinema, even within the most fantastic plot structures, is hugely important and please don't muck around with the history. I actually find the changing of military events, way more controversial than any subject matter and everyone (and I mean everyone) is a valid target for jokes; well just ask Mel Brooks. Art in any form should never be bound by moral codes, otherwise nothing of any worth would ever be produced."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2020,10/10,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I laughed and I cried and I cried. Impossibly beautiful.
JOJO RABBIT,5 September 2020,1/10,"Who would greenlight something so ill conceived?Life Is Beautiful was a funny, touching movie about a family that endures during deadly, grim hardship at the hands of WWII Germans.JoJo Rabbit is a shrill, unfunny try-hard attempt by a third-rate hack to find dark comedy among those same WWII Germans.But why? Who on Earth was sitting around thinking, what we really need is a comedy about the Holocaust from the Nazi Youth point of view.Special Razzie mention surely must go to ScarJo, who puts on arguably the worst foreign accent in contemporary cinema."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,5/10,"How this movie got a nomination for Best Picture baffles me. It's not terrible. There's certainly some imagination to it. But it goes nowhere - except to the obvious ending. Ideas introduced early in the picture, like Jojo being told by his invisible friend to develop the characteristics of the rabbit, never get developed. Sometimes there is comedy of anachronism when we hear modern pop music, like the Beatles, while watching a scene from World War II, but that too goes nowhere. Yes, there's certainly a change in Jojo's views on Hitler and anti-semitism, but they come for obvious reasons.I found myself wishing it would end long before it did.According to an article I read before writing this, the director/script writer added a great deal of his own material, including the imaginary friend, to this movie, and cut out most of the second half of the novel on which he based it. I don't expect feature movies to reproduce exactly the works on which they are based, but the radical changes made here from the source may explain why this movie doesn't hold together very well.Catch this at home on streaming or dvd. I was sorry I went to see it in a theater, where I was stuck just watching it for the whole picture."
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is unique, funny and has a great story. WW2 provides an interesting backdrop to this tale. This has to be the funniest and most witty interpretation of Adolf Hitler I have seen. The humour is well done but it also manages to maintain a serious tone. A great story and bond is shown between Elsa and Jojo highlighting the idiocy and myths regarding the Jews. Good performance by Thomasin McKenzie and young Roman Davis. Taika Waititi is off course showing he not only a great director but actor.

Taika Waititi is off course showing he not only a great director but actor. 8/10"
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,10/10,If u like dark comedies then this one fits the bill. The ending was kinda sad.
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,8/10,"Seen a trailer for this last year & knew I had to watch.The film is about a young boy named Jojo, dressed like Hitler in the Nazi German attire & lives with his mum in a small village. One day, he finds his mum is harbouring a Jewish girl in their family attic. At first he doesn't what to do as she threatens him in a hostile manner. But as the days & weeks go on he starts to befriend her.I found the film to be quite good. It was funny, sad, dark & subtle in many ways. The satire humour was also well done & kept the perfect balance of comedy & seriousness throughout it's 1 hour & 43 minute run time. The actors & actress done well, some new blood mixed in with some actors I have seen before.Overall a good film & a great one start off the new year/decade 2020.8/10"
JOJO RABBIT,2 August 2020,3/10,"This movie is nether funny nor clever. The one thing it is for certain, is a huge waste of time. Had to fast forward every 15 minutes since the humor was silly, not clever in any way. After a while, it all became repetitive. I can only assume that the high ratings are a marketing ploy to draw people in to watching this huge waste of time. I am now no longer surprised as to the reason I have never heard of this movie at all! It's the kind that plays in very small ""art cinemas"" then goes straight to streaming and ultimate oblivion!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,8/10,"An earnest boy in a comically violent society finds himself in a dilemma when he discovers one of the enemy a bit too close to home.Unusual comedy that swings between Gunther Grass and Mel Brooks, with a touch of Terry Gilliam, but finds its own peculiar rhythm. I think its main strength is in taking familiar aspects of the end of the war in Germany and giving them a unique angle. As for the comedy, plenty of fruitful set pieces. but only one genuine scream of a laugh just before the final scene. And there is a very touching scene involving shoes and a gallows.Thematically, the only disappointment is that it didn't nail the lie of race - while it impishly mocked Aryanism and Aryan notions of Jewishness, it shied away from Jewish biblicalism.There are some problems with the casting, because they use a few known comedians who aren't really film actors, and the lead actor starts off a little wobbly before hitting his stride. Even so, the imaginary friend device works perfectly. Otherwise, the performances are very good, with Rockwell the pick of the bunch.There is the novelty, for me, of two famous songs performed in German by the original artists, and overall the soundtrack is excellent, not obtrusive. The cinematography is fine, with the Czech urban locations dominating the visual feast.Overall: light touch on a heavy subject, but the only true movie on this subject remains Come And See.ps.for fans of J-horror, I think there was a Ju-on joke in there, but it didn't quite work."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,10/10,"Taika really knocks it out of the park with one of the finest satires ever made. Think of the song, ""Springtime for Hitler"", extended into a beautiful, funny, touching film. Jojo is a little boy, raised in Nazi Germany, whose imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler (played hysterically by Taika, the funniest Hitler since Dick Shawn in The Producers). But he learns that Nazism isn't everything... I won't say anymore other than see this movie. One final thing: the academy should be embarrassed for robbing this film of a best picture oscar."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,9/10,"It was a little hard to wrap my head around poking fun at the brutally Nazi regime, but, in this case, comedy is the ultimate disinfectant. Taika Waititi executes his twisted but incisive creation with brilliance. The casting is excellent. The performances are unforgettable. The tragedy is gut wrenching. Fully deserving of its award attention, I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Anti-hate satire}"
JOJO RABBIT,21 March 2020,8/10,"Directed by Taika Waititi. Starring Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Archie Yates, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Luke Brandon Field, Sam Haygarth. (R)In the waning days of the war, young Johannes (Davis) dreams of becoming a Nazi and serving the Fatherland--he even has Adolf Hitler (Waititi) as an imaginary friend--but he begins to have doubts after discovering a Jewish girl (McKenzie) hiding in his attic and realizing that's she's nothing like the despicable stereotypes he'd been taught about her people. Writer/director Waititi's idiosyncratic Nazi comedy is more ""daring"" than ""brave,"" the distinction being that he's willing to push boundaries for a nervous-but-genuine laugh, yet he still mostly stays in safe territory by not addressing the ugliest truths, and only directly dealing with darkness when plumbing for sentiment or sadness--less the black comedy or satire it appears to be on the surface than an irreverent lampoon with a reassuring heart. The whimsical nature of the humor does, however, successfully capture the absurdity of war and the ignorance of evil, and the film rarely falls short on the task of being entertaining and/or touching. Smart casting invigorates the material, even if Rockwell could do this sort of role in his sleep by now and McKenzie's youth-in-hiding is more of an emblem or prop than fully-realized character. Waititi's script won an Academy Award. Alfie Allen has a cameo.79/100"
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,7/10,What good quality movie this is a futuristic looking movie just wow
JOJO RABBIT,6 April 2020,7/10,"Irreverent humor (and/or satire) is a difficult genre to crack, but Waititi once again shows he can completely own his script and get the best out of his performers. To be honest, I didn't particularly find the first 30-40 minutes to be that amusing, but as the second act commenced, it started growing on me. The film beautifully portrays the warm, funny, and morose relationships between Jojo (a fantastic Roman Griffin Davis, who brings adorable 10-year-old-isms to the table with a dash of harmless, satirical fanaticism for Hitler) and a bunch of people around him - his bestie Yorki (Archie Yates, who has got great timing in humor), his mother Rosie (a wonderful-as-always Scarlett Johansson), and his new Jewish acquaintance Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, who's wildly effective), to name a few.There's also his imaginary best friend Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi himself, getting the funniest lines) and Captain Klenzendorf (a bubbly Sam Rockwell) playing important roles. As I said, once you've okayed yourself with the nature of the film's irreverence, you're in for a joy ride. The second half features a particularly hysterical scene with Stephen Merchant making a cameo. To add to that, I need to give kudos to Waititi for transitioning between hilarious and heartbreaking in a matter of seconds, in one specific scene (cannot spoil it!) so brilliantly. I cannot remember the last time a shot of a woman's feet was used to convey something so intense and powerful.Jojo's transformation from a 'Heil Hitler'-ing fanatic to a boy fluttering with dreams, hopes, and humanity, has been written and performed in a very believable manner. In terms of wackiness, I'd give Rebel Wilson's character an extra point. Every time she showed up, hilarity ensued. Jojo Rabbit may be set in trying times, but it is a feel-good watch indeed, ably supported by its classy production design, pleasing soundtrack, and a lot of benevolence (a.k.a tying each other's shoelaces)."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,5/10,"JoJo RabbitNot everyone's cup of tea, the movie had two strands, the allegorical story of JoJo representing Germany's brainwashed consciousness towards Nazisism and a little boy's struggle to make sense of world as the man of the house during a time of war.After an hour in I thought the joke wore thin, surreality can only hold the attention for so long without any anchors. I laughed about three times throughout this is hardly a high score for a supposed comedy.We had two fine performances from Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell and the rest was uninspiring. To my mind neither performances displayed sufficient range to merit an award however maybe Scarlett for a supporting award, after all the young boy was the star of this movie.The only redemption lay with JoJo becoming disillusioned with being a Nazis, hardly a surprise, and really quite insufficient."
JOJO RABBIT,20 December 2020,8/10,"JoJo rabbit follows the story of a young German boy
who is obsessed with his hero, Adolf Hitler. His life is turned upside down when he discovers that his Nazi mother is a member of the resistence, and is hiding a young Jewish girl within the walls of their house.
This film manages to approach serious and traditionally offensive topics with class and without being too dark. It's a fine balance between a dark subject matter and comedy. It is heartbreaking and heartfelt at the same time. The performances are excellent all around; Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo suit his role very well, his friend Yorki who is equally naive as JoJo is played by Archie Yates in a charming hilarious way. The rest of the supporting casts are phenomenal Taika Waititi played the satirical version of Hitler and pull it off nicely, Sam Rockwell is excellent as usual, Thomasin Mckenzie as Elsa is also fantastic, now Scarlett Johansson as the glamorous mother of JoJo is what impressed me the most. Scar Jo gave one of the most strongest performance in her career, she pulled off the complexity of her character effortlessly, one scene that struck me the most in the entire movie, is the one that she pretends to be JoJo's father, it's a really powerful scene and acting. You also see how the attention to her shoes played a vital in the movie.
The film is visually beautiful and the cinematography is top-notch with great camera-work that captured the sceneries very well. The score by Michael Giacchino is captivating. The costumes and hairstyle are also very fitting of the era.
On the whole, What Taika Waititi has done with JoJo is nothing short of spectacular, the writing and directing are spot-on. It is refreshingly original and well executed, crafted story of heartbreak, love, growth and hope."
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,6/10,"I thought this movie was really funny. I only got 30 minutes into it. When ScarJo came on the screen, it got a bit boring. But it was kinda funny until then. Not Oscar worthy by any means, but something unusual. Just a weird movie.It might be a treat to watch. Not sure if I'd recommend it or even enjoy talking about it. But it had its stuff going on.6 stars"
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,10/10,"Anyone who thinks that it is some sort of a sacrilege to treat Hitler and the Nazis with humor should just go jump out of a twenty-story window (hopefully they will land on a like-minded person and kill two birds with one stone, so to speak). I always thought that had someone stood up in one of those Munich beer halls and laughed at Hitler, showing the rest of the deranged crowd what a ridiculous little a-hole he was, we could have side-stepped the worst chapter in human history.Laugh out loud funny at times. The bit about the mix up of the dogs was my favorite joke in the film, giving the very funny Sam Rockwell the best line in the movie.The acting was superb all around. The little boy was masterful. I always blame good and bad acting on the director, so chapeau to Taika Waititi. Getting a good performance out of a child is always a masterful performance by the director."
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2019,,"Films have parodied the Nazis even while WWII raged, including everyone from Chaplin to The Three Stooges to Mel Brooks. Enter Taiki Waititi seemingly channeling Wes Anderson in JOJO RABBIT. Waititi turns up the trademark Anderson Twee barometer to 11 right from the outset. A ten year old Hitler Youth to be named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) has an imaginary friend. And, he's not just your typical fanciful pal, but Hitler himself (Waititi). The Fake Fuhrer has a goofy grin and prances about like a reject from a Dresden burlesque show. The effect is like an even sillier Hogan's Heroes for a while.
Fortunately, things settle down once a teenage Jewish girl in hiding is introduced - Elsa, played by the terrific young actress Thomasin McKenzie (LEAVE NO TRACE). Elsa becomes the heart and soul of the movie and keeps it grounded. Jojo's mom (Scarlett Johansson) also brings some gravitas to the story despite also being a bit of a caricature at the outset. Jojo and Elsa strike up a guarded friendship of sorts despite being on 'opposite' sides - and, of course, the constant pestering of Fake Fuhrer (not to mention the intrusions of the Gestapo represented here by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson). Rockwell and Wilson are out-sized cartoon villains who also seemingly have studied every frame of Wes Anderson's guide to broad acting. Archie Yates is genuinely affecting as Jojo's hapless friend Yorki.
JOJO RABBIT, despite far too many arch attempts at humor, eventually does get it points across. The music choices (often intentionally anachronistic) usually work (particularly for the touching coda), and Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography has some exceptional compositions. The Elsa/Jojo relationship garners some genuine moments of pathos and warmth (something Anderson rarely achieves). Waititi obviously means well, but, he is is own worst enemy as he himself turns in the most grating performance of all as Fake Fuhrer and wrote the screenplay (based on a novel). Every time McKenzie and Davis do their best to elevate the uneven storyline, Fake Fuhrer interrupts the flow and the mood. It is no exaggeration to say that the movie would be vastly improved with excision of the character entirely. At the very least, Waititi fails to give the gimmick a real reason to be. The irony is too mild, the arc so narrow that the character becomes virtually meaningless.
JOJO RABBIT is affecting on a certain level, but for a movie that bills itself as ""An Anti-Hate Satire"" it's pretty weak tea. Making a movie with Hitler as a sidekick will offend some just on it's face, so you may as well bring something much more cutting to justify it, but Waititi is more content with playing nice. For a parable about a youth in Germany during this period with teeth, seek out Volker Schlöndorff's masterful THE TIN DRUM (based on Gunter Grass' novel). JOJO is more akin to Roberto Bengini's benign if also affecting LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL."
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,7/10,"It's been a little while since I saw Jojo Rabbit, and I neglected to review it straight away because it was somewhat difficult to work out exactly how I felt about it. It's a bold, entertaining, sometimes funny yet sometimes heartbreaking premise, it's confidently shot and well acted, it uses music to great effect, and also carries a strong, agreeable message. But something felt off, and it's prevented me from loving it as much as all those positive qualities would suggest. Perhaps the end result is less than the sum of its parts, but a rewatch at some point in the future could help things click a little better.For now though, this is still a very good film that doesn't quite cross over into 'great' for me personally, but is still worth recommending. Looking at WW2 through the eyes of a child isn't something that's never been done before, but to have the child not only be on the side of the Germans but initially idolize the Nazi Party certainly feels like a new take. It mostly works, and I didn't find the film insensitive- or offensive for the sake of just being offensive- in any manner. Lampooning WW2 and the Nazi Party was done nearly 80 years ago, in Chaplin's The Great Dictator (while the war was still going no less!), let's not forget.I was reminded of Chaplin playing a clear stand-in for Hitler in that film when watching Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi play (an imaginary friend version of) Hitler in this film. The best thing about this is the fact that Waititi is part Jewish and part Maori, so the real Hitler would have absolutely despised being portrayed by someone of Waititi's background. It's an entertaining performance and leads to many of the movie's funniest scenes, but one flaw with it is that I think the same story and its messages could still come across just fine without the imaginary Hitler subplot.That might make the film overall less of a dramedy/tragicomedy and more of flat out war drama, and as for whether or not this would have made it better overall, I'm not sure. The comedy works, and when the film goes for drama, it works too. Neither really clashes. But still, as a whole it never clicked for me quite the way I wanted to. It could be on me more than it is on the film, especially because even now, almost a month after seeing it, I still can't put my finger on exactly what stopped me from absolutely loving this movie.The only other mild problem I can cite is that the film drags slightly in its second act, with some of the scenes between Jojo and the girl he discovers hiding in his house's attic being not as engaging as other parts of the film. Oddly enough, this is the most prominent aspect of the film, but I found other characters- like Scarlett Johansson's and Sam Rockwell's- more interesting. It still works and eventually pays off well, but I didn't love every scene while the movie was happening.It's been obvious since his Flight of the Conchords days that Waititi could write great scripts, but with Jojo Rabbit it's apparent that he's continuing to get even better as a director, with this being his most visually pleasing and well-directed movie yet. The screenplay is mostly great too, though the end product does not quite coalesce into something I totally loved. However I do want to see it again, and all the stuff I liked has really stuck with me.Maybe for films like this, that are particularly tonally ambitious and out there in terms of some of their creative decisions, are simply worth watching and forming your own opinion on."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2020,6/10,"I am usually a big fan of Taika Waititi and considering the good rating and awards nomination I had good expectations. Unlike a lot of critics I don't have an issue trying to create a comedy around the subject matter if it's done well. However I can't quite put my finger on why it is, but I didn't find this funny enough, or dramatic enough, or emotional enough. It's cute with good performances from the cast, but it wants to be too many things at once and in the end doesn't quite succeed with any of them. it was entertaining enough but definitely a disappointment for me."
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2020,5/10,"This movie is only funny but for kids. It is unrealistic. Bit annoying and too much talk. Too much annoying behavior, but this is forgivable because it is movie for kids. Bit negative because it tries to demonstrate serious and sad history in funny way. Bit realistic because it shows bit of real life history and human behaviors and feelings. Bit emotional. But can't be compared to some of the best movies which have more serious and realistic topic, plus they can be more funny. There is too much attention given to kids, like it is more about their acting skills rather than quality of the movie or our feelings. More boring at beginning, less boring at the end. Great graphics, but still amateur. Lacks some serious and realistic content and real actors. Everything too amateur, vague, too simple and forced."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,7/10,"In an unnamed German city, Johannes Beltzer aka Jojo Rabbit (played by Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy enlisted in the Hitler Youth organization during the later years of World War II. Despite his naive dedication to Nazism, his clumsiness leaves him unsuitable for the harder aspects of junior war duty.While the spoken language in the film is English, notes, posters, and pamphlets are in German. This mix is questionable but less questionable than the film's mix of satirical humour with genuine drama.Jojo has an imaginary adult Nazi friend named Adolf (a light caricature of Hitler) played by the film's writer/director, Taika Waititi. Much of the humour (attempted or otherwise) seems to be at Jojo's expense in a sometimes sadistic way. Interestingly, the dark humour / satire aspects of the film's first half seem unnecessary as well as silly. Its dramatic side (more prominent in the second half) is quite touching and could have stood alone without earlier attempts at lightness.All scenes involving Jojo's mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) raise the film to a higher level. This is not just due to the performance but also the very different character: someone who tries her best to shed light on her and Jojo's situation while her country has sunk to the lowest depths.There are also three exceptional scenes. One involves an unusual revelation of a death that is shocking and heartbreaking. Another involves an unexpected visit by the Gestapo to inspect Jojo's home. A surprising twist occurs in that scene - one that creates much fear and tension. And finally, the scene that indicates the end of the war is very powerful. That scene includes humour that is actually quite fitting via Jojo's friend Yorki, (Archie Yates), another Hitler Youth misfit who spews out absurd Nazi lies including outrageous assumptions about British soldiers.Portraying a teenaged Jewish girl who has experienced far more than any young person should have, Thomasin McKenzie shows great talent. In silence, her face shows many pent-up, conflicting emotions. Hopefully, she will be in many more movies in the years ahead."
JOJO RABBIT,16 December 2019,10/10,Honestly this is easily my favourite film of 2019 and possibly in the running for of all time. I was nearly crying with laughter at points before sadness in the next moment with an overwhelming feel of pure happiness and enjoyment at the end. An at times bizarre yet beautiful piece of film that must be seen to be appreciated. Superb.
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2020,8/10,"No wonder this won the oscar for best adapted screenplay (and nominated for 5 other oscar categories). Waititi is a genius!!Seriously! This was an incredible movie. Combination of satire, dark comedy, and drama,,, there were so many funny moments that quickly turned into horror, and vice versa.The cast!!! Oh the cast was so good!! The 3 main kids were perfect!! Johansson, Wilson, and Rockwell never disappointed. Now let's talk about Waititi as Hitler,,, ROTFLOL!!!JUST GO WATCH IT!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,2/10,"The film would have been a great SNL skit, but as a film it leaves a lot to be desired. I'll admit that it's hard to get laughs from the Nazis, Hogan's Heroes not withstanding. But it's not merely the juvenile humor that doesn't light the spark, it's the constant lapsing of accents, the modern idioms, and the kid's forgetting that he limps. I left after half an hour so maybe I'm wrong and maybe somehow the film got better."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2021,8/10,"Towards the end of the second world war, a young German boy called JoJo who is in Hitler's youth army stumbles across a Jewish girl. His mother has been hiding her in their attic, right under his nose. This discovery forces him to change his preconceptions regarding what he has been told to believe in. With the help of his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, young JoJo tries to get his read around what is right and wrong.This 2019 film is a comedy drama that is set in a small German town towards the end of the second world war and offers some nice satire of the situation too. It's rare that a war film which deals with a dark and brutal topic like this one does can be so colourful and fun, but director Taika Waititi does a great job. Waititi does well not just in directing the movie of course, but also working on the screenplay from Christine Leunens ""Caging Skies"" book and starring in the film as the imaginary Adolf Hitler. The whole of the casting in fact is great; debutant Roman Griffin Davis is great as the lovable JoJo, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful as JoJo's mother Rosie, and Thomasin McKenzie is engaging and endearing as Elsa. The supporting cast all do a great job, from Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen and Rebel Wilson as the local Nazi leaders who begrudgingly do their jobs to keep the town safe; to Stephen Merchant as the entertaining but menacing as a gestapo officer; and even young Archie Yates as Yorki who almost steals every scene he is in.This is a weird but funny film which is heart-warming and heart-breaking at the same time. I think this film will divide audiences and critics alike. Some people will mock the idea that Taika Waititi brings in this film without appreciating the style, structure, or the humour and satire. Some people won't give it a chance, and some will be upset with the vision that the film paints because they may argue that not enough time has passed since the Nazi atrocities occurred. In short, the film pokes fun at things that weren't that fun to be involved with or to be affected by. To dismiss it though would be to dismiss the history that this planet shares, rather than being able to look back and learn from it. This film looks back on history and does so in a mocking way. What Waititi does here is great, and with a musical score by Michael Giacchino and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's cinematography, this really is a fun and engaging film. If you give it a chance this film is likely to have you laughing one minute and crying the next minute. For anybody worrying that this film will be heavy watch, or it might be difficult if you are not in the mood for it - I can assure you, this film is quite light-hearted, so do not be put off.I recommend this film highly. It extends the great work in film that the director and production crew have done so far. Above everything this is a fun and engaging story. It might not be a glitzy and glamourous film like Hollywood has led most people to believe is the standard that all films should achieve in order to be taken seriously, but it is a film with a massive heart and a great sense of humour. A colourful film with style, which is camp and pokes fun at the topic it is covering, and pokes fun at itself too."
JOJO RABBIT,9 August 2020,4/10,"Waititi's humor, imposibly stupid and overacted/overdone, fails the 1/3 (just to say a number) of the movie that has honestly good dramatic scenes, that would've worked perfectly if not surrounded by so many jokes so lame, that ruins everything else.It's not a parody like """"What we do in the Shadows"""", but it's not a """"feel good drama"""" completely, nor particularly smart, save for a handful of lines or ideas here and there.
But if you laugh with Waititi's humor, then you would of course like it, I guess."
JOJO RABBIT,20 October 2019,8/10,"Before Thor: Ragnarok, there was What We Do In The Shadows. A very funny and wonderfully written mockumentary following the lives of a group of vampires. Thor: Ragnarok was definitely the best Thor film and is one of the more entertaining additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I know we would have quality and good humor from Taika Waititi's newest film and was hyped for it. A comedic take on Nazis and an imaginary Hitler? Count me in. I ended up liking this more than I thought I would especially in the third act.The film is about a young German boy living in Nazi Germany. He talks to his imaginary friend, an eccentric Adolf Hitler and wants to learn how to become tougher. He discovers that his mother is actually anti-Nazi and is hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a secret wall of their house. Initially, Jojo (the main character) is resistant to her because of the Nazi philosophy he has been taught but soon he becomes compassionate towards her and even loves her. However, her livelihood is at stake especially at a time where the Gestapo actively search for hidden Jews.I'd love to praise the performances in this film. I think all around there is excellence. Each character works in their dramatic and comedic element. The film is funny as I thought it would be. Waititi has proven to be excellent in penning humorous work. However, what shocked me most was the level of emotion and humanity that the film deals with, and its done so well. Its a tough line that the film has to balance itself on. Its subject matter involves the darkest time in human history and yet the film takes a comedic approach to it and to one of the vilest figures in history, Hitler. This is no easy task, but Waititi does it and brings the quality.I liked this a lot more than I thought it would and felt like the relationship between Jojo and Elsa was just so beautiful. The humor is at times dark but always witty and I just found it to be a joy to laugh along with it. I'm glad I went out of my way to see this as I think its a memorable effort and one that I can't wait to look back on. Its a film that deals with balancing emotions and its just done well.7.5/10"
JOJO RABBIT,28 May 2020,3/10,"I've seen a lot of movies about the Second World War and this movie is one of the bad ones, because for me it was boring."
JOJO RABBIT,19 August 2020,3/10,"This is one of those rare works that is so bad it's almost good. A young boy, in the last months of he war, identifies with Hitler and creates him as a mental companion. It's a good idea for a story. But it is poorly done. A basic question is whether anything about Nazism, even seventy years later, can be funny. There also are careless, unjustified errors. Hitler loathed tobacco and was a vegan. Yet he hands out cigarettes and, in one scene, is seated at a dinner table with a huge turkey, which, come to think of it, is a fitting metaphor for the film itself."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,7/10,"When I first saw the trailers for Jojo Rabbit (2019), I thought this movie looked like a fun and satirical romp through Nazi Germany. With the director (Taika Waititi) portraying an imaginary Adolf Hitler, the comedy was in full display during the trailers. After all, Waititi directed Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which is arguably one of the funniest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Plus, Jojo Rabbit seemed to focus on a 10-year-old boy (Roman Griffin Davis) in the Hitler Youth, which gave some strong Boy Scout vibes that I could potentially relate to.Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed to find that the trailers contained all the comedy in Jojo Rabbit. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as the remainder of the film gave some amount of cynicism and reality to the fanatical enthusiasm of Jojo and the other members of the Hitler Youth. In fact, there's a significant scene that really hits home with the constant theme of tying shoelaces leading up to (and after) this emotional moment. At its base, Jojo Rabbit also has to show the ugliness of war. It highlights the contrast between the nastiness of the real Hitler and the silliness of an imaginary Hitler.While it wasn't entirely what I expected, Jojo Rabbit did deliver in a few key areas. First off, the feel of the whole film seemed reminiscent of Moonrise Kingdom (2012), which is one of my favorite Wes Anderson films (again, see my connection to the Boy Scouts). Add in heavy doses of The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), and the result is this unique take on life in Germany during World War II. It might not have been entirely what I had expected (toning down and trimming a lot of the aspects from the book, Caging Skies), but it was entirely what I needed to see.A funny and poignant view of WWII from the eyes of a German boy, I give Jojo Rabbit 3.5 stars out of 5."
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year-old Nazi supporter, Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo discovers that his mother Rosie(Scarlett Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa(Thomasin McKenzie), in their house.Jojo Rabbit is a fantastic film. Writer-director Taika Waititi has given us another masterpiece after, What We Do in the Shadows(2014), Hunt for the Wilderpeople(2016) & Thor: Ragnarok(2017). This movie is hysterical for the most part. However, there are also scenes that will make you tear up & when the credits start rolling, you will be forced to introspect. That is the beauty of Jojo Rabbit. The performances are the highlight of the film. Roman Griffin Davis knocks it out of the park in his acting debut, as Jojo. Davis carries the movie on his shoulders & portrays a wide variety of emotions, over the course of its run-time. Thomasin McKenzie is spectacular as Elsa. McKenzie gives us a flawless performance & she is an actress to watch out for, in Hollywood. Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as Rosie. Johansson definitely deserves both her Oscar nominations. Best Actress for Marriage Story & Best Supporting Actress for this movie. Taika Waititi is brilliant as Adolf. Waititi brings his signature brand of humor, to his performance. Sam Rockwell is awesome as Captain Klenzendorf. Rebel Wilson is great as Fraulein Rahm. Alfie Allen is superb as Finkel. Stephen Merchant is unforgettable as Deertz. Archie Yates is adorable as Yorki. Jojo Rabbit is a must watch. It deserves all the nominations, this awards season."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,9/10,"Writer/Director/Actor Taika Waititi is one of the most original voices working in Film/Television today. He skewered the Vampire flick (at the height of the Twilight craze) in WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS. He revived the sagging Thor saga (and some would say the Marvel Cinematic Universe) with a comedic approach to the material in THOR: RAGNAROK, and now with his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, he takes his sense of humor to a subject that is difficult to satire - Adolph Hitler and life in Nazi Germany during WW II.And, darn it all, if he doesn't pull it off.As seen through the eyes of a zealous 10 year old Hitler Youth named JoJo, this film follows Jojo's journey from an idealistic follower of all things Nazi Germany to the harsher realities of the world - and what the 3rd Reich means to the world.Young Roman Griffin Davis does a marvelous job as the titular character slowly changing his character from an all out innocent devotion to Hitler (his imaginary friend as played by Waititi) to a somewhat less innocent soul. His journey is at the heart of this film and he is a winning personality to follow along with. I was drawn into his struggles and was rooting for him to ""come to his senses"" throughout the course of this film.Helping him in this journey is his Mother, played in an Oscar nominated turn by Scarlett Johannson. This character has an idealism all of her own and is willing to let her child ""get there in his own time"". It is a strong turn by Johannson...but Oscar nominated worthy? I'm not sure.Also joining in for fun, frolic and (by turns) seriousness is the always great Sam Rockwell (Oscar winner for 3 BILLBOARDS...)as a disillusioned German Officer, comedian Stephen Merchant (LOGAN) in an unlikely mostly serious turn as a Nazi who likes to say ""Heil Hitler"" and Alfie Allen (GAME OF THRONES) as a devoted German soldier (at least devoted to Rockwell's character). Waititi also uses Rebel Wilson sparingly - as she should be used - as another devouted-to-the-cause German citizen.Adding heft and pathos to this film is Thomasin MacKenzie (THE KING) in a role that would be a spoiler to say what she is playing, but...I WILL say that she needs to succeed in this role for the film to succeed (and she does).Also, special notice needs to be made of the performance of cherubic Archie Yates (soon to be Kevin in the reboot of the HOME ALONE franchise) as JoJo's friend Yorki - who keeps getting knocked down and steps back up over and over again. I would LOVE to see the film that would have focused on this character (in addition to this film).And, finally, there is the Writer/Director himself, Taika Waititi as JoJo's imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler. He is all fun loving and gay at the beginning becoming more and more frantic as the film progresses - mimicking the real life events that are happening around him.Waititi's style in this film is reminiscent of Wes Anderson in such films as THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL and MOONRISE KINGDOM and this works well here, giving this film more of a ""fable"" than a ""realistic"" look - and that is important to help set the tone for the events that follow. Waititi has a sure hand on the material (that he wrote) as the Director. He knows the tone he wants to strike and knows how to get there. He is nominated for Adapted Screenplay for his script (deservedly so) and was NOT nominated for Best Director - but his work in this area is just as good.I did not know what to expect from this film when I walked into it, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Give this little comedy/drama a try - I think you will be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,7/10,"A film featuring Adolf Hitler in a comedic role wouldn't be an obvious choice for the awards season. Jojo Rabbit did feature frequently in this years awards categories though. Not sure whether there was any controversy surrounding the subject matter, but guess it may have been a difficult one to get a green light into production.The movie tells the tale of a nazi youth fanatic Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) and a young jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). The young Jojo daydreams about Adolf Hitler who is played by director Taika Waititi. The supporting cast are excellent and include Scarlet Johansson, Rebel Wilson, Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant.The movie was obviously a labour of love for Waititi and it's good that he pulled it off so well. The movie is very funny in parts and also very touching as well. The two young actors aren't overshadowed by their elders and should have a fine future in the movies. Well worth a watch."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,10/10,"I love movies and I love writing movie reviews. I'm not going to write a review of ""Jojo Rabbit."" I'm just going to say, ""Go see Jojo Rabbit."" This movie made me and the person I saw it with laugh, cry, and think. It's the best theatrical-release movie I've seen in 2019, and 2019 is almost over. It's audacious, courageous, moving, unforgettable, original, deeply human, and it gets under your skin. Reward this kind of filmmaking with your ticket-buying dollars.""Jojo Rabbit"" is about a ten-year-old Hitler Youth member living in a German city during the waning days of World War II. He's just a child so he has swallowed Nazi ideology whole. He has an imaginary friend: Adolf Hitler. Jojo lives with his mother, and he attends Hitler Youth meetings.Making a comedy about Nazism is a tough task. Many have tried and failed. One false move and this movie would be splat all over the floor. There are no false moves. ""Jojo Rabbit"" is supremely confident. It moves like a well-oiled machine. I don't want to say much more because I want you to be surprised and delighted as I was.I can say the performances are terrific. I found Sam Rockwell, as a Hitler Youth commander, to be particularly compelling. His final scene in this film is one that will stay with me for a long time.Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother ripped my heart right out of my chest. Rebel Wilson is hysterically funny. Thomasin McKenzie has the gravity of a veteran performer twice her age, and when she finally smiles an innocent, little girl smile it tugs at your heart. Archie Yates, as Jojo's fat friend, is adorable. The tall, thin, pale man who played the Gestapo commander is appropriately terrifying and also funny.This may have been a low-budget movie but the production values are high. The interiors send you back in time eighty years. Scarlett Johansson wears a green art-deco sweater I wanted to reach through the screen and borrow, and maybe never return.Taika Waititi as Hitler is, at first, simply funny. But then there's a scene where he really unleashes, and it's terrifying. It's clear that Waititi has watched video of Hitler giving speeches and managed to mimic every crazed, hate-mongering gesture.Go see this movie. Please. And you're welcome."
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2019,10/10,"REVIEW - JOJO RABBITUk release date 3 January 2020Let everything happen to you,
Beauty and terror,
Just keep going,
No feeling is final.Very rarely a film comes along which bowls you over,
Very rarely a film comes along which excites, upsets and makes you laugh out loud.I know for a fact the studio who made this film are scared of making it and scared about its release, Disney have been reluctant to release it and that may explain why it had such a limited run in the USA, but honestly.....Experience the second world war through the eyes of a 10 year old boy who just wants to fit in with his friends and so joins the Brown Shirts before finding, hiding in the wall space something that makes him second guess the propaganda being fed to him.Truly an amazing film and Jojos imaginary friend simply adds to the shock value but also the humour of the film, showing how the propaganda machine influenced people in Germany during the second world war.Definitely one to watch as soon as you can!Rating 10 out of 10"
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,8/10,"Taika Waititi's much discussed movie is an odd beast. Set in a small German town towards the end of the war, Jojo (Roman Griffith Davis), is a young boy indoctrinated with Nazi fervour as a member of the Hitler youth. Together with his rotund and bespectacled friend Yorki (Archie Yates), they are not likely to spread fear into the approaching Allied forces: they are a pair that would be likely to get picked last for 'sides' in a school football match.Perhaps to bolster his flagging self-esteem, Jojo has an imaginary friend - - Adolf Hitler (played by director Taika Waititi). Hitler provides him with sage - and sometimes foolish - advice. His mother (Scarlett Johansson), as well as obviously being hot and thus obtaining lustful looks from returning troops, is also kindly. She makes up for the absence of Jojo's father, due to the war, with the help of some play-acting and a sooty beard.But, when alone in the house, Jojo hears noises from upstairs, his world - and his whole belief system - begins to unravel.Comedies have tip-toed around the sensibilities of World War II in the past, most famously with Mel Brook's ""The Producers"". I don't think anyone's previously been brave enough to introduce the holocaust into the comedy mix. And - to a degree... we are NOT talking excessive bad taste here - the movie goes there. There's an underlying sharpness to some of the dialogue that - despite not being Jewish myself - nevertheless put my sensibilities on edge: the pit in hell 'set aside for Jews', for example, is filled with not only piranhas... but also bacon.As a satire lampooning Antisemitism, much of the comedy is slapstick and the anti-Jewish sentiments expressed are deliberately ludicrous. And it's one of my issues I guess with the film. There are some good lines (Rebel Wilson's fanatical Nazi screaming ""Let's burn some books"" at the students) but some of the slapstick farce just didn't work for me. Sam Rockwell is great as a one-eyed ex-war hero looking for new challenges and exuberant costumes! But a lame gag from him about German Shepherds made me go ""What? Really?"". And this lessens the impact for me of the satire.The second half of the film for me was far better, taking a much darker and edgier tone. There's a sudden turn in the film - brilliantly executed - that is truly shocking. This scene is somewhat reminiscent of one in that other great Holocaust comedy, ""Schindler's List"". It's understated, yet devastating. (Now, before seeing the film I'd heard from other reviews that the film ""turned darker"" and - based on the trailer - I'd kind of set in my mind what that would be. But I was wrong! So take this comment not as a spoiler, but as an anti-spoiler!).As the war unravels for Germany, a late re-appearance by the imaginary Hitler is also memorable.As the young star, Welsh kid Roman Griffith Davis - with no previous acting experience - turns in a star performance. Though to say that the performance ranks alongside the top 5 male performances of 2019 is, I think, overstepping the mark. Scarlett Johansson got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role. And I think this is deserved.Elsewhere in the cast, few seemed to have recognized Thomasin McKenzie's role playing Elsa. The 19 year-old New Zealander really delivered for me. A strong female character, she's vulnerable yet with a will of iron under the surface. She made me really care about the outcome of the story.Less positive for me is Rebel Wilson. Here she is marginally less annoying than I normally find her in that she's playing a deliberately annoying and unhinged character. But the role seemed largely redundant to me: it didn't add anything to the overall story (unlike Rockwell's - surprising - character arc).If there was an Oscar for originality - and that WOULD be a good new award category - then this film would be a contender. It's certainly novel: amusing in places; disturbing in others. If you like your comedies on the edge and bit whacky - like ""Death of Stalin"" - then you will probably enjoy this. I'm not sure it's the best film of the year - and there are probably others I would swap into that Oscars nomination list - but it's still a well-made movie and a recommended watch.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web. Thanks)"
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,7/10,"Jojo Rabbit is one of those rare films that separates itself from the common Hollywood mold. A fictional historic look at the Hitler Youth Camps and how one boy was indoctrinated by Nazi propaganda, Rabbit shows how the mightiest of anti-semitism can be overcome by common sense and love.The acting is top-notch. I fell in love with Scarlett Johansson on the screen. Her combination of humor and pathos was riveting. And the 10-year-old boy, first timer, Roman Griffin Davis, displays one of the most engaging youth acting I've seen in a long time.Can't say enough about this film. But I'm not quite sure of the worthiness of being nominated for Best Picture Oscar. It's a good movie--but great? I'll reserve that opinion to history."
JOJO RABBIT,19 November 2019,10/10,"Taika Waititi is either a genius or absolutely crazy.Jojo Rabbit is an absolute blast of a film from start to finish. It's a coming-of-age, over-the-top, war-drama. The film is both light in humor and heavy in topic. It handles darkest sides of war in the most childlike innocence. It's one of the most unconventional satire I've seen.Certain (obvious) aspects of this film can be divisive in today's culture. Yet, Taika Waititi handles every aspect of the film well. His role as an imaginary Asian-Hitler is a moment of comedic genius. For everything that could of went wrong with this film, themes and comedy are handled in an adult way. None of the jokes felt ""cheap"" by any means. You will find yourself laughing and crying with this film.The casting choices work in harmony. Roman Griffin Davis's role as Jojo keeps the audience sympathetic to his character. Scarlett Johansson shows real mother-child chemistry with Jojo. Real (innocent) romance can be felt between Jojo and Thomasin McKenzie's character. Taika Waititi is over-the-top and hilarious -- as an imaginary friend should be.5/5. Absolutely see this film. It's a rollercoaster of emotion that will leave you feeling better at the end."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,9/10,"It goes without saying that today's generation doesn't take to offensive humour as much as they used to, or at least be as forgiving as they used to. For that reason alone I was surprised to see a movie like Jojo Rabbit even get made. After watching it, it also seems like a very necessary and welcome release for today's day. I'm so happy a film like this was made because the rich environment and characters Taika Waititi creates here are worth the price of admission alone. Although this humour absolutely won't be for everyone and may even be a little too off-beat for some, here's why I believe Jojo Rabbit is a fantastic satire, even if some may not enjoy it.In Nazi Germany, a young boy in Jojo Roman Griffin Davis) is oblivious to the horrors that Hitler represents, so he creates him as an imaginary friend to help him through his struggles. As the plot kicks into gear, he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding Elsa, a Jewish girl, in the walls of their house. This is a film that seems funny on its surface and does have quite a few great laughs, but the surrounding atmosphere and overall story are meant to be taken very seriously. This worked very well for me and I think the end result made for a fun, moving piece of filmmaking.Taika Waititi is definitely not new to the director's chair, but I always find myself impressed with his work. Whether it be in creating the fantastic Hunt for the Wilderpeople or the highly entertaining Thor: Ragnarok, his style is very unique. With that said, I think Jojo Rabbit is his best work to date. This is the most I've ever seen him juggle comedy and drama so well together and they never seemed to clash. I will always look forward to his upcoming projects because, at the very least, they will have some kind of entertaining aspect.From Roman Griffin Davis in the title role to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, Scarlett Johansson as the mysterious Rosie to the absolutely hysterical Archie Yates as Jojo's best friend Yorki, this film is littered with talent. On top of that talent, these characters were written by Waititi with care, adapted from the novel by Christine Leunens. There was never a moment where I questioned if a certain performer should have been cast in any of these roles because although there is some great emotion, it's all played up as fun. I really enjoyed the ride this movie took me on.Overall, Jojo Rabbit suffers from the fact that the humour is quite dry and won't be for everyone, but if ultimately one of the better films I've seen all year. Filled with laughter, heart, a meaningful story with a terrific message and gut punches that you wouldn't expect, I think Jojo Rabbit is deserving of its praises. At a mere 100 minutes, this movie flies by, delivering a really enjoyable viewing experience. As long as you know what you're in for, I highly recommend this one."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,5/10,"I can't believe that this film is nominated for best film instead of Rocketman the Elton John bio but it seems I'm out of step . It may be perhaps that I'm part of a generation born in 1949 at the end of the era that the 2nd World War occurred and can't find any hilarity in its aftermath.As I often say Film appreciation is a very personal thing often depending on our own life experience and views I never mind differing from the mainstream view as shown with my Review of Cats recently or agreeing with the mainstream as shown in my reviews of 1917 or Little Women but I know what I like and expect in Cinema and I also know that they're will always be ""Emperors New Clothes "" films and if I see it that way I have to call it as I see it.What will people find funny next a comedy about 9/11 or GayBashing or even the evils of Child Abuse in Religious organisations may be the subject of ""comedy satire""in the future."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,6/10,To combine war and comedy is a new one. but i feel like it was stuck between the two. i think the movie should have gone all in with the comedy and a little less with the romance. but in the end its a decent movie.6/10: ok
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,6/10,"Ill-conceived, toothless satire riddled with embarrassingly unfunny, immature jokes that I couldn't help cringing at. This was my opinion of after an hour of watching Jojo Rabbit. The only merits I found in the first hour of the film are the undeniably decent performances, the stunning cinematography and the impressively colourful production design that bleeds into the costumes as well. Even the ""sweet' and ""charming"" moments were hit-or-miss for me.After the first hour, I can say that I found myself touched and moved out of the blue. I figured out that the film dramatically is quite effective. And if that says anything, it's that the dramatic set-up is actually great but Waititi's insistence to convince us, in a most factitious and pretentious way, that his film possess the punch, which it claims to be having, utterly blinded me of its emotional heft, which it definitely there, and it did take me off guard.What's more off-putting than the cringe-worthy, infantile humour and the lame attempts at satire is that it tries to conceal its toothless satire behind the fact it's told from the perspective of a 10-year-old boy, which is true but inadequate and even kinda irrelevant, and the fact Waititi tried so hard to make it work satirically is the ultimate proof.The film also suffers from jarring tonal shifts, but I think this is a relatively minor issue. Maybe it's too generous of me to give this film such rating, but I can't deny how emotionally impactful it ended up being. Also, Thomasin McKenzie. WOW!(6.5/10)"
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2020,8/10,"I went into this film a bit worried concerning the incredibly horrific nature of the film dealing with the Nazis and antisemitism. Thankfully, I think it handled the film very well without being offensive.The film revolves around a little boy called JoJo (played surprisingly well by Roman Griffin Davis) and directed by the brilliant Taika Waititi, who also plays the hilarious imagery Hitler. The characters are charming and quirky and the script is rather quite clever, plot wise it's not what you'd expect from the trailer and description but it really is good. Scarlett Johansson, Thomasin McKenzie and Sam Rockwell all do great jobs in their roles, and Rebel Wilson's presence is thankfully inoffensive and actually quite funny, shocker.There's a lot of emotional moments as well as comedic ones, I feel like they could have pushed the film to be just a bit more sad in places but overall there's an acceptable blend of comedy and emotion.8/10: Creatively produced and well acted"
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is quite simply one of the best films I've seen. I would say this year, but its only January 5th - so I'm happy to put that claim into the 'ever' section of my reviews!With such simplicity, director Taika Waititi gives us an emotional roller-coaster ride of hilarious comedy, heartbreaking moments, poignant scenes, romance, friendship, realism, and war... And he delivers it almost flawlessly in one of the greatest satirical movies ever.Child actor Roman Griffin Davis is just super cute as Jojo, delivering an incredible performance as a dedicated child of Hitlers youth who's only dream is to be in his army and is guided through life by his imaginary friend - Hitler himself, played hilariously by director Taika!Taika just nails it as an insecure leader of the people, offering up ridiculous plans and ideas to try and guide little Jojo through life as a nazi. His portrayal of der Fuher is just brilliant and, to me, came across like a human version of Bugs Bunny in many physical moments as well as his silly ideas...Loved it!In fact, the casting of everyone involved just works wonderfully!! I couldn't find fault with any of them. Scarlett was brillaint as his mother as was Thomasin McKenzie as his Jew friend-love-interest hiding in the attic. Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen's hidden love was so well done, as were their characters, and Jojo's little friend Yorki is equally as cute and funny with his little random scenes and delivery, but for me, RGD totally steals the show as Jojo - delivering a number of heartbreaking moments with such a natural performance.I love Jojo Rabbit and can't wait to see it again!An amazing film!!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,"It takes a lot to combine all the elements in this movie, humour, satire, slapstick and tragedy. As best as I could figure, the tragedy of war, the cruelty of nazism, the kindness and love of a mother and her heroic sacrifice, as well as the innocence of a child, not to mention an Anne Frank like character thrown into the mix required a special glue to bind it all, the wacky satire was that glue. If it's not, I'll be damned if I can explain how else the movie worked because I was moved by it.A first time eleven year old actor, Roman Griffin Davis, has the main character role, Jojo, and he has the bulk of the acting time in this movie; this is definitely proof that this kid has talent, because he is believable throughout all of it. Scarlett Johansson has far less screen time but what little of it she has, as Jojo's mom, she delivers with inspiration, including the funny bits in her early appearance confronting Captain Klensendorf, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell is an actor I've liked for a long time and I'm happy to say he's had a very good year with this performance and the one in ""Best of Enemies""; he's also acting in ""Richard Jewell and in the mini-series ""Fosse/Verdon"" which I'll be catching soon. Spoiler: He saves the life of Elsa and of Jojo, respectively by covering for Elsa's impersonation of Jojo's dead sister when the Gestapo conducts a search of Jojo's home, then by faking his nazi outrage toward Jojo so he would not be taken in as a supporter, just before a bomb blast kills him, one that would have killed Jojo as well. I had to mention it as Klensendorf's is pretty much of a buffoon the rest of the time and some might miss that.This leaves one more actor, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Anne Frank like character because she is hiding in Jojo's home, behind the walls, and she's Jewish, even looks a bit like Anne Frank. She's nineteen years old, plays a sixteen year old and has the cinematic experience of a thirty year old, since her acting debut at 12, another one to watch, like Roman Griffin Davis. Davis' character plays the reluctant young cadet in Hitler's army, one who doesn't belong and who's inspired to try anyway by an imaginary and funny Adolph Hitler only Jojo can see, an artistic license the movie required, but it worked for me.I know some will not be able to take in the tragic elements for the funny bits and for others it will be the other way around, but for those patient enough to keep an open mind, you will not be disappointed; I was not, I was, as previously mentioned, moved. Taika Waititi, the writer director deserves kudos for that."
JOJO RABBIT,29 February 2020,10/10,"The low or mixed reviews has me questioning viewing Jojo Rabbit, but it's definitely worth the viewing. Strong humour stops this from being just another Nazi storyline. This was on my top 9 list of 2019 so I would recommend checking out this truly unique film."
JOJO RABBIT,6 December 2019,6/10,"This is a charming movie, but it's not really as insightful or original as its admirers seem to think.To begin with, there are some screamingly obvious parallels with the book that was once regarded as the cornerstone of American literature, Mark Twain's THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN.Jo Jo is an awful lot like Huck. He's a small boy who's been more or less abandoned by a deeply corrupt society. Left to himself, he literally stumbles across a fellow outcast -- only he's been taught to hate Jews, just the way Huck has been taught to despise black slaves. Jo Jo and Elsa have lots and lots of long talks when they're all alone together in the spooky abandoned house, just the way Huck and Jim talk when they're all alone on the big river. And gradually they become friends.So far so good, and it's impossible not to enjoy the way Jo Jo and Elsa grow as characters and the amazing chemistry of the two young actors who play them. But this movie sentimentalizes the adult figures in Jo Jo's life in a way that Mark Twain would have found nauseating.The Widow Douglas is the closest think Huck has to a mother. She's kind to him in her way, but she's no smarter or better than the adults around her where racial prejudice is concerned. She's a slave owner and she never pretends to see blacks as equal -- not even when she's praying with them! Now Jo Jo's mother is played by the stunning and talented Scarlett Johannsen, and the problem is that she's too good to be true. Too brave, too glamorous, too sexy, too open-minded. With a mother like that, how could Jo Jo have ever become a Nazi in the first place? There's a desperate sentimentality at work in how the mother is portrayed. Like, women can't be evil, so we'll just make the mother a ""woke"" 21st century feminist who happens to live in Nazi Germany.The movie sidesteps other problems as well. Jo Jo is a little boy, and we're supposed to believe he only is attracted to Hitler for childish reasons. He likes the uniforms, the saluting, and stuff like that. He has no anger of his own, no resentments, no grievances, no life experience. Compare Jo Jo to Hando, the skinhead Russell Crowe plays in ROMPER STOMPER. Try to imagine what Hando would have done if he had stumbled across a girl like Elsa!Now think about Elsa herself. She's got a sharp tongue and she's vividly drawn, but -- no spoiler intended -- when push comes to shove she's remarkably patient and understanding. There's a line that's quoted in a lot of reviews, ""you're ten years old, Jo Jo. Act like it."" That line puzzled me, but the point I think is that Elsa and everyone else is willing to forgive Jo Jo just because he's a kid. Forgiveness is a big part of what the movie is about, and what Elsa is about as a character.But that sidesteps the question of what being hated and seeing your whole family murdered would actually do to a girl like Elsa. She's a very different character from Gabrielle/Shoshana in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. The extraordinary thing is that both characters come from the exact same historical moment, but they react to it in opposite ways. And the supreme moment of vengeance in one movie and the supreme moment of forgiveness in the other movie are both backed up by songs of David Bowie!I wasn't outraged by the light tone or the positive message of Jo Jo Rabbit, but I don't think it's a profound masterpiece either. Too many of the more unpleasant questions go unanswered and Jo Jo's forgiveness comes a little too easily."
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,9/10,"Mix of dark comedy and serious drama.Set in Germany during World War II, the star is a 10 year old boy at a military youth training camp, his imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler. Adolf would appear when any mentoring is required. His mother is sheltering a Jewish girl, he discovers her hiding in the attic and a relationship develops, this conflicts with his anti-Semitic indoctrination.This movie depicts the horrors of war through a child's point of view with some big scale sets towards the end when the allies arrive. This movie may not be for everyone, but it's very different and highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,8/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Taika Waititi delivers one of those films I absolutely love for the exact same reasons some people deeply hate it. His seamless balance between comedy and war drama makes Jojo Rabbit a thought-provoking yet hilarious depiction of how ridiculous Hitler's followers were. Roman Griffin Davis offers one of the best young performances of the millenium, and the rest of the cast is pitch-perfect. There's a lot of laughs, but also a lot of heart. Still, be warned: if you're easily offended, this movie isn't suited for you. Either go in with an open mind or don't go in.Rating: A-"
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,7/10,"A satire of the sharpest proportion, and a central relationship that is hard not to love."
JOJO RABBIT,20 April 2020,10/10,"Alright. This intro is funny.No stabbing!Those girls were the stand-ins for Mean Girls.Nice shrug fat boy friend.A tear drop specialist seems like a cool thing.That's not so bad. This can breed may high school rumors.See ya truck idiot. You're going to die.You can't call her little when she is twice your size.Metal is the strongest, then dynamite, then muscles ... great line.That is a tall man.To state the obvious Hitler is being a d!(k.The local old ladies club learning to fire RPGs.NOOOOOOOO!The worst spotting of a friend ever :)Aside from what he said he stabbed you. He does deserve a slap... then a dance."
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,9/10,Funny and sweet in that unique Taika Waititi way.Everyone gives fantastic performances in this powerful and suprisingly emotional satire.It also has possibly the greatest F-bomb in a PG-13 movie ever
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,8/10,"A good 'comedy' to pass 1hr40mins with.It's a comedy, though it's not 'hilarious' as some are claiming... I laughed once, and giggled maybe twice... so it's definitely NOT 'hilarious'... it's just a nice little comedy, with a good story thrown in (the story, btw, is very reminiscent of Inglourious Basterds).Taika Waititi (the director) is starting to build up a nice resume of movies, and it certainly helps that (so far) 3 of his movie are 8/10 movies in my book, so it's CLEAR that he has talent and he's still got a long career ahead of him... I think of his as the 'Kiwi Tarantino'"
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,9/10,"It was a very refreshing take on a nazi war film. Definitely risky and a lot so balls involved to make the satire work and not backfiring. Taika Waitti had those balls and went even further than you would actually have expected. Its the kind of film you can do now but couldn't haven been done even 5 years ago.
What I liked most of it that it works during both phases, the comedic ones but also the dramatic ones. There are many shifts of emotions involved and it never feels over the place but exactly giving the audience a mixture of different moods. Acting is great. Roman Griffin Davis is absolutely THE discovery of the year. What an awesome performance for a young first timer. Very intense, funny and absolutely on the note. Excellent job and I am really looking forward to his next films. Thomasin McKenzie was also very good and proved herself as the perfect choice for the role. Sam Rockwell was perfectly cast and played that role with a lot of self irony but also heart. Rebel Wilson was really on fire here and also well chosen for the role she played. Of course there was Archie Yates who just like Davis is a great discovery and played wonderfully. Scarlett Johansson had many strong moments and is absolutely deserving every kind of love she is getting this year. She could have played that mother role pretty standard but she realy added a lot to it. Last but certainly not least there was Taika Waitti himself in the role of Hitler - well imaginary Hitler. Also such a on-the point performance with so much right irony.
A film that worked but could have easily failed. Its one of the most heart warming, funny but also sad films of the year."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama war film written and directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Based on the novel ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunens, it successfully blends quirky humour and heavy hitting drama without ever losing sight of its own unique identity.During the last years of World War II, the timid ten-year-old Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) joins the Hitler Youth as he longs to defend his Nazi German homeland from the allied powers. Supporting him along the way is his imaginary friend - an eccentric childlike version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). After refusing to kill a rabbit during a training exercise, Johannes is given the derogatory nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" by the other youth members. One day, Jojo discovers to his shock that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a young Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the wall of their house. Knowing full well that they will all be executed if the Nazis find out, Jojo decides to strike a deal with Elsa in that he will protect her in exchange for her sharing ""Jew secrets"" with him.As is the case with all of Taika Waititi's films, Jojo Rabbit is filled with his signature tongue-in-cheek comedy that even the most casual of audiences can enjoy. Most of the laughs come from scenes where Jojo's interacts with the imaginary Hitler, which is what someone of his age would perceive Hitler to be like. However, whenever the film needs to touch on serious topics, such as the Jewish plight under Nazi rule, the film never trivialises such a thing and handles it in a respectful manner. This is a difficult film to get the tone just right for, but thanks to the careful efforts of Waititi, he manages to strike that perfect balance between funny and sombre.In terms of production values, this may be Waititi's best work to date. His use of muted background colours is particularly noteworthy, as it helps make his lead cast members stand out in several scenes, especially during parts where they need to be seen separately from other Nazi characters. The use of cinematography is great as well, as we are shown the widespread Nazi presence in Jojo's small village, whether it's the tanks all lined up against buildings or the ""unpatriotic deserters"" being hanged in the streets. This again reminds us that even though the film is technically a comedy, it still uses Nazi Germany as a backdrop, who were responsible for many horrific acts.All of the cast members did a superb job in their roles. Young newcomer Roman Griffin Davis carries the film in such a natural fashion that it is hard to believe that this is his very first role in a motion picture. He and Thomasin McKenzie, the latter of whom rose to prominence with her memorable performance in the 2018 film ""Leave No Trace"", had such wonderful on-screen chemistry and I loved watching the two of them interact with one another in spite of their character's polar opposites. Scarlett Johansson is also worth noting as Jojo's mother Rosie. Even though her screen time is limited, she leaves an impression thanks to her ability to chew the scenery as much as possible.In conclusion, while the film's use of Nazi Germany as a backdrop for a comedy may seem off-putting to some mainstream viewers, any fan of Taika Waititi's work should enjoy it immensely. It truly shows how far he has come since his humble beginnings back in New Zealand and certainly has me on board for any future projects he has lined up for us.I rate it 8.5/10"
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,6/10,"Not much less, it's a movie, that you watch it, enjoy it, entertain yourself, and in the end, you feel good and that's it. It has neither the charm, nor the smell, nor the sensation of being watching movies.In no time, you enter the game of being in a Nazi Germany. They have preferred to show them as idiots to show them as what they were and thus they would have given greater force to the children. It is what this type of cinema has. As it does not put you in the skin of some, then you cannot put yourself in the skin of others and enjoy the good things.The kids are great. They are not like other children, they are fine, they do take you with the movie. However, the elders, well, apart from ridiculous, I imagine it is what he wants, but you do not believe them or give you anything. Nor is Scarlett for Oscar, papers like that, there are thousands during the year.I don't deserve any of the nominations.The lighting, surely everyone who has seen it, thought it was at war, or rather, on the beach.The director's job, because apart from the children, the rest is no wonder. If it is true, that the slow motion of the end, was at great risk of being passed and has finished very well, even being too long. The narration with the camera is null and although the tone does not fade, it fails to convey what it should, to my liking.It is a movie, to watch and entertain."
JOJO RABBIT,15 December 2019,6/10,This movie is about a kid who wants to be a Nazi but deep inside he's a more heroic person. The temptation to become a Nazi is represented by his imaginary friend Adolph Hitler. The kid finds a Jewish girl his mother is hiding in their house and he has to choose whether to turn her in or not. The film at times is funny but it also has many flat moments when the adults aren't on screen and it doesn't work as well it should given the gravity of the subject matter- it also too many goofy woke-tropes that take from the emotional realism.
JOJO RABBIT,1 December 2019,9/10,"People expecting a hard-hitting takedown of the Third Reich are looking in the wrong place. This is meant to be an amusing satire poking fun at the ridiculous nature of Nazi Germany while also providing some heartfelt and meaningful messages. Jojo Rabbit gets serious when it needs to, but the war is seen through the eyes of a 10 year old, thus it views the war with that sentiment. In addition to writing and directing, Taika Watiti's boldest move with this film is playing an imaginary Adolf Hitler, with hilarious results. I appreciate that Jojo Rabbit is not afraid to push the envelope and that in spite of its subject matter, it will leave you feeling hopeful and with a smile on your face."
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,8/10,"I was slightly skeptical about this film. Another movie about Nazis? Another comedic take on the Holocaust? (By the Thor Ragnarok guy?) We have been here and done that, after all. But I was wrong. This movie was about Nazis to a certain extent, but it was more about what it means to be born and raised within a worldview only to realize something's off. Jojo's journey starts when he meets someone who defies his expectations and causes him to question everything. I would argue that's where most journeys start. And this film managed to capture that while also making the audience laugh and think and feel tense all at once. It was a historical film that transcended its genre and time period. Sometimes revisiting the familiar allows you to find something entirely new...and worthwhile."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,7/10,"Someone walked out of the general store (sun shining). They immediately had a vision and it immediately turned into a burning need. So it made him leave a nickle on the ground (unguarded). The person thought that if they went to do an honest days volunteer work on the plains with the sweat at their boot, then that nickle would still be there waiting for them (no one would of taken it). The days end ment a blow of the wind on the gresses of the plains, the dim sun barely lighting a birds worn face, ss mclune (a former human) up in a tree with a picture of a woman rubberbanded over his eye sight. When the individual went to see if the nickle was still there he did indeed find it there. He noticed a man walking by and said: could you believe it, no one took my nickle. And the man said: yah, i wouldn't of had to take it because of the pills i take, they allow me to not need anything, most of everything i do is bare minimum, like, for instance, i still brush my teeth."
JOJO RABBIT,30 October 2019,5/10,"Not sure what the film maker was going for. satire. laughs. irony. your guess is as good as mine. nothing really works. a young boy has hitler as an imaginary friend. he discovers jews are human beings, like himself. bad things happen. etc."
JOJO RABBIT,20 May 2020,8/10,"Who could have thought a dark humour film about the Hitler's Youth set in the back drop be this good? The premise of this film is that a mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in her house but her son JoJo(Roman Davis) discovers this secret....JoJo has an imagery friend that steals the film... What makes this film so good is the well written script & the remarkable cast. The comedy stem from the lies that he is taught from this German propaganda & poor JoJo spouts them out as though it is the absolute truth. I found both Rebel Wilson & Stephen Merchant hilarious. Even though it has those funny moments throughout this film, in its core it still shows the real tragedies of the war."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,7/10,"So this has had some mixed reviews and I can see why. Anyone who's watched the trailer and isn't caught a little off guard by the sight of a jovial Hitler... well surely those people don't exist anymore. Anyway it's clearly meant as offbeat satire, something that director Taika Waititi is known for and known to be fantastic at (What We Do in the Shadows). It is funny ""Get together kids, it's time to burn some books""... but really not nearly as funny as it needs to be to get away with this kind of humour. Mel Brooks' Hitler in The Producers was funny, an out an out piss-take, but here the comedy doesn't seem quite farcical enough. For every ""We have a job for you walking the clones"", there's people hanging in the town square and Jews hiding for their lives. It's a really odd balancing act. I'm not going to slate it, I think it tries really hard to poke fun, but it's just a really difficult subject to have fun with, especially when the story is told through the eyes of a member of the nazi youth clinging on wilfully to his indoctrination. It's an odd mix between the Diary of Anne a frank and Moonrise Kingdom, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, laugh a little and find it interesting. Sam Rockwell is pretty great, Scarlett Johansson is good as the closest thing to an anchor and voice of reason against nazi propaganda, Rebel Wilson though is a bit annoying. There are some genuinely great lines ""There are no weak Jews, I'm descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants, we were chosen by god, you were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full moustache"", but I'm really not sure what to make of it and might need to watch it again. The scenes between the two young leads are intriguing and offer the most depth as the nazi gets an education he doesn't realise he needs. A visit from the Gestapo is a shocking leveller though amongst the frivolity and again makes the humour feel oddly misplaced. Some will love this and quite understandably so, others will feel uncomfortable, but regardless I think it's a must see film... probably more than once, if only just to see Hitler kicked through a window."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,5/10,"If you can get past the painful anachronistic quality of the language or the fine line between dark humor and tasteless this may be for you. There may have been a reason Jerry Lewis decided not to release ""The Day The Clown Cried"" Simply put...the Holocaust and those who chose to fight on their behalf between lines probably deserves a respectful tone. Instead...the very modern attitude makes it seem like a farce. It's extremely dishonest and when serious things DO happen, you cannot undo them. Towards the end, we get a taste of what that is.
I will give director Waititi credit...this is a swing for the fences, and for the most part works, but I think it'll leave many people wondering why. That said...the other grating thing is knowing the audience knows how reality turns out. Hitler loses. In a bizarro world, it doesn't feel like he does here. In fact, regardless of the child (literally) kicking Hitler to the curb, you sense indoctrination is taken too lightly.
Still...some touching moments with mom Scarlett Johansson though her German accent is horrific...and the efforts to make her this angelic savior of Jewd feels phony. Given Hollywood's penchant for concealing their own monsters.
I'd say middling is very fair."
JOJO RABBIT,15 August 2021,8/10,"Taika Waititi caught my attention when he made one of the best and most surprising Marvel films with Thor: Ragnarok and Waititi continues to surprise with Jojo Rabbit.Jojo Rabbit follows Jojo, a Hitler Youth member that finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home's attic.This film has been a part of my watchlist for the longest time and I'm amazed by Taika Waititi's creative vision. Making a comedic film about the Holocaust is sure to stir up controversy but it has to be understood that this film is a satirical take on the subject. It takes guts to make a film like this but Waititi's incredible skills as a writer and director turned this film into a triumphant one. What genuinely surprised me was the amount of heart it had. The comedic elements were great all the way through and had me laughing quite a few times but where Waititi excels is the balance between the comedic and serious tones. The caricatured portrayal of the Nazis were fun to watch and it's visible how Waititi is poking fun at them. The light-hearted tone works in the film's favour as it's shown from the eyes of a ten year old boy. From Waititi's portrayal of Adolf Hitler to the colourful backdrop, all these aspects play according to Jojo's perspective. It's when he meets the Jewish girl, Elsa, the film slowly loses the comedy and takes a serious yet heartwarming turn to show the true horridness of the situation. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s change in lighting can attest to that. I didn't expect the film to be this touching but it worked and really stuck with me.The dynamic between Jojo and Elsa works so well due to Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie's fantastic performances. They work so well together and the script gives them opportunities for fun and tragic moments that stick with you. The supporting actors all do a wonderful job in their roles. Archie Yates as Jojo's best friend is very good despite his limited role. Taika Waititi's caricatured performance as Adolf Hitler is very entertaining. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as usual. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson are given some amazing dialogues and are also great in their roles.Jojo Rabbit was a huge surprise for me. To get strong child performances and create a light-hearted film about such a dark event from the past is no easy feat but Taika Waititi's manages to successfully execute it. I honestly cannot wait to see what else he'll come up with."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,"JoJo Rabbit is a brilliant and brave attempt by Taika Waititi. This movie is crafted by pure creativity. 'An anti hate satire' is the tagline of the movie and the movie shows the Nazi era difficulties through humour and mind blowing dialogue (most from Scarlett Johansson). This was the year that I realised ScaJoh is an excellent actress. All of the cast was excellent including Roman Griffin Davies, Thomasin McKenzie (who both have a bright future), Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson and an excellent Sam Rockwell. The fat boy also deserves mentioned. JoJo Rabbit deserves acclaim and more people should see it. I don't know why most of the critics hated it but screw them. Jojo Rabbit deserved that Oscar nod for Best Picture and even though there's no hope for winning it, I'm pretty sure the movie has inspired so much hearts and this movie will discussed in the future."
JOJO RABBIT,21 August 2021,7/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a comedy film with a huge message of adulthood. It is hilarious and amusing in various moments but it gives a sense of seriousness at the same point.Jojo is a young boy in the youth scouts of Hitler who believes strongly in the ideology of Nazism. Jojo is shown as a true patriot to Germany. Only his beliefs are shaken when he finds a Jewish girl in his house and befriends with her, not to mention that he has an imaginary friend in the shape of Adolf Hitler.Roman Griffin Davis (Jojo) and Thomazin Mckenzie (Elsa) are the staring actors in this film, along with Taika Watiti who is phenomenal in his portrayal of Hitler. Scarlet Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson are also very amusing.What I mostly liked about this film is how it showcases the war from the point of view of Jojo, a ten year old kid who knows nothing about the world. In other words, innocent. From the start of the movie till the ending, jojo faces a huge character development and learns that not all is so bright. He even admits to his friend Yorki that nothing makes sense anymore.In other words, Jojo Rabbit is a touching story about the brutality of war and how it can affect the mind of a child. Not to mention it's sweet moments such as Jojo and his mother's moments, the punch jokes over the state of the country, Jojo and Elsa's conflicts and more. Definitely a must watch for its a remarkable movie."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,7/10,"Although the subject matter won't be to everyone's taste, this coming of age drama with humourous moments gives a realistic and bleak depiction of both the fanaticism and anti-hate ideas in Germany during the end of World War II. It's very smart about what it achieves, but I would have liked to see more humour and outlandishness as it is a bit slow in parts. Great acting from Jojo as the lead and strong performances from the rest of the cast, and good use of music too."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,5/10,"While an odd comparison due to the contexts of subject matter, Jojo Rabbit feels like my Vice of 2019, but with better humor and even less to say. It is entertaining enough and has a couple solid performances, but doesn't feel like it has a real point. It's meant to be an anti-hate satire, and Hitler as an imaginary friend was a clever way of getting at that, but the absurd unrealism of all the German training/Reich scenes deadened the seriousness of the Nazi beliefs and the emotional impact of most scenes. It was obvious in poking fun at how ridiculous and over-the-top Nazi beliefs were by showing them through the eyes of a blind faith 10 year old, but it really didn't have anywhere to go from there. I would've liked to see more of how they get people like Jojo to buy their propaganda and beliefs, but instead we just have to accept that that's who he is at the start, which makes his turn to accept Elsa not emotionally impactful. The comedy is inconsistent - it has some really good moments (I loved the circumcision joke), but also a bunch that didn't land. The script is fairly spotty overall, particularly in the relationship between Jojo and his mother. There was a strange distance between them that is never explained, almost as though she's a step mother. After it gets the satirical premise out there in the first act, it stumbles through most of the second and third acts and ends pretty pointlessly.It's not all bad though, and that's primarily thanks to Thomasin McKenzie. Between her unbelievable performance in Leave No Trace last year and now a great turn here, she's quickly become one of my favorite actresses. The only emotional resonance the movie has is in her fearful disposition to the world outside and her developing bond with Jojo, and honestly the humor that lands best is her knowing teasing of Jojo. I like Rockwell as always and liked his final scene, but there wasn't quite enough leading up to it to give it the full emotional force it could've had. It is an absolute abomination that Scarlett Johansson got a supporting actress nomination - she doesn't do much here and her performance is nothing at all compared to McKenzie's. I will be infuriated if this movie wins adapted screenplay over Little Women, as is likely, because it was a script that did a poor job with its characters aside from Elsa, had no arc or anything to think about, and even the comedy that I thought would be its hallmark was spotty. It's not quite a bad movie, but it's shallow, providing nothing interesting to mull over, and falls on its face balancing absurdist humor with emotional or serious war scenes."
JOJO RABBIT,27 June 2020,9/10,"Caught this on dvd today for £2! (3 films for £6 for 2 nights :) I thought this film was brilliant. It's got a great script, great casting, great acting, well directed, and it's also funny and sad. Loved it 9/10."
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,6/10,"No doubt this is a charming well produced film, but at nearly 2 hours long the story becomes tedious."
JOJO RABBIT,30 May 2021,9/10,"Another 2019 movie that kicked ass. It is always interesting to see the other side of war, and they were able to do it with comedy yet also give me chills. Jojo is a character that I will remember for a while, and so far Taika has yet to make a movie that I do not love!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 May 2020,8/10,"The Pianist and The Schindler's List are two of my favorite movies so that's why I watched Jojo too.
First, the movie is risky, dramatic, funny and intense. I love it. The script is pretty well developed and the cinematography is top.
Second, main character's acting is superb. A masterclass. I really enjoyed all the scenes with Hitler.
Last, sound editing and music are great too. Pretty good choices and amazing tracks. The ending scene is my favorite.
So, overall a fantastic movie to watch close to other masterpieces like The Pianist and Schindler's List."
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,3/10,"What did I miss here? A brainwashed Hitler youth, realizes that Jews do not actually have horns, and becomes friendly with one. OMG. So incredibly profound. I have no issues with making a comedy about the Nazis. Just make sure to get a decent writer, who has some understanding of humanity. Not much here, i am afraid."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit Review:
Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism. Just by the plot synapsis, I don't know how anybody couldn't be interested. Also with Taika Waititi directing, writing, and staring it in, that makes it on a whole new level, which it is. I found myself having a great time throughout the film. I saw it at a 10:40 showing on a whim after a long day and it was worth it. The story is what hooked me right at the start. It dives right in from the beginning with the Nazi camp. It reminded me so much of Moonrise Kingdom with the style and the whole camp. I will add there was a little trouble with tone switching and that affected the story just a little at the beginning before getting to the main conflict of Scarlett Johansson's character hiding a Jewish girl in their house. The story is good at the beginning but the tone had a little awkwardness to it. The acting is very strong in here as well. Obviously Taika Waititi portrays a good Hitler. Very comical and being like him. I'd push for him to get nominated for best supporting actor, but that category is pretty full at the moment. The other supporting character, Johansson, is also really strong. I'd say this is my favorite performance that I've seen from her and I'd push for her for the nomination as well, but it's also a tight race for that category. Her character had so much to say to spread a good message. All of her likes me at so much. Also her character was kind of crazy, in a good way, which made for such an entertaining watch. The way she raises Jojo, played by the marvelous Roman Griffin Davis, and their relationship was my favorite aspect. Just all the relationships in general I should add. I'm just amazed that this was Davis's first time acting in a film. I can see a Golden Globe nomination in his future. But by far the best performance, which I didn't expect, came from Thomasin McKenzie. I just wish people would talk about her more. Every scene from her was practically flawless. Just her character in general made me smile from her wittiness and feel sad for her situation. Personally she has had one of the best performances of the entire year. The film is very good with its humor. Many people have been worried beforehand that it would be offensive, but somehow they never cross the line with it. Rebel Wilson has a smaller role and she makes joke all the time. I thought she was hilarious and good at providing humor. Alongside Wilson is Sam Rockwell and he was pretty funny as well but more serious, especially as the film progresses. So there's a point, about a little over halfway through, where the tone switches completely to very serious. I went from laughing to basically on the verge of tears. At that point the film really soared and I didn't want it to end. So much happened and that was it's strong part, story-wise. It managed to get back to the satire part in a good way to provide some levity to the dark situation. The film really ended perfectly. I couldn't ask for a better ending to this. For the technicalities and all of that, the cinematography was really good. It captured everything in a unique way, at least I thought, and the amazing production design. I will riot if the production design isn't nominated for anything. The score had that camp sound to it, once again very similar to Moonrise Kingdom. Overall Jojo Rabbit is a beautiful film. There's a few flaws here and there but it soars. I think with the strong message and the popularity of it, there's a strong chance of it winning best picture. It's a little hard at the moment since there's not a strong front runner, which is a good sign, but I consider it a strong front runner. Definitely see this if you get the chance. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed.My Grade: A-"
JOJO RABBIT,2 September 2020,8/10,"Coming of age movies are a genre that I quite enjoy, if done right. This one definitely takes it in a different direction. Taika Waititi has been taking the world by storm, and I'll watch anything he makes, or is in. An all around very good cast and setting. Sure the accents vary, but that can be easily ignored for comedic reasoning."

JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,10/10,...an absolute laugh a minute with tremendous performances and the best child actors I have ever ever seen on film. The comedy always steals up on you and is performance led but with some fantastic zingers. Much better than its premise gives it any right to be. It's a damn near perfect film.
JOJO RABBIT,8 March 2020,10/10,"Wow! I loved this film. I'm not sure what I was expecting from Jojo Rabbit, but I got so much more than I could have hoped for. Taika Waititi is to be admired for taking on the subject matter and producing a film that is simultaneously hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking.Before saying anything else I have to applaud the performance of Roman Griffin Davis. This is one of the best child performances I've seen in a long long time, with his comedic timing and delivery both exceptional. Aside from a few dodgy German accents, the rest of the cast were also great. Waititi himself as the Fuhrer was inspired, providing some comedic moments that you won't be forgetting in a hurry.Jojo Rabbit was so brazen and unapologetic in its satire, creating so many laughs. I'm not normally one to laugh out loud at films, however I couldn't stop myself belly laughing numerous times. The humour was such a delight and balanced so well with the more sobering elements. This contrast was so clever as the humour lulled me into a false sense of security, making the emotional punches all the more powerful.The script was so sharp and intelligent and delivered expertly by the cast.Through its comedic lense Jojo Rabbit told at its heart a very emotional story. A boy blinded by fanaticism and and Hitler's cult of personality, coming to terms with the fact that all he had blindly accepted may not be true. In this respect Jojo Rabbit was very original as I can't quite recall a comedy which packs such a punch while maintaining its hilarity.Incredibly moving, funny, intelligent and surprising, Jojo Rabbit is a must watch, one of my favourite movies of recent years and one that I will constantly be returning to."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,7/10,"With so much trash coming out I see too many people praising the mediocre films coming out from mere desperation for something halfway decent. Then comes a real gem like this that really deserves the recognition. It was hilariously funny and also very sad.I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by the approach to it. The acting was done with truthfulness even though the writing was obviously satire. They didn't overdo it, which is refreshing to see.I am really critical of films and they seem to be getting worse so having something like this to enjoy is a blessing.I wish they had the Yorki character (the fat kid) in more as he was just amazing. I save 10 stars for the truly amazing films that stand the test of time and this is a close 8, but I will leave at 7 until I see it again with time passing and still feel the same.One of the funniest scenes is where Fraulein Rahm tells the nazi kid ""you see that American, go give him a hug"" while she straps a hand grenade on his body.. hahaA perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. Definitely a must see."
JOJO RABBIT,20 October 2021,1/10,"As soon as I saw the mainstream actors I knew to lower my expectations but I still hoped for some neutral nazi humor.Sadly, half the movie is a 20 year old woman abusing a 9 year old kid and I gotta admit, that's pretty cringe of a premise.The humor wasn't as good as I expected, nor was the whole premise of this movie. Love was somewhere there, but super misguided and akwkard.Overall, this movie has no point, lacks good humor, lacks pretty much anything. It's not worth watching."
JOJO RABBIT,16 July 2020,10/10,"Just an awesome piece of cinematography! The acting, the script, the costumes - everything is top notch! The acting of the young folks especially! And hats off to Scarlett Johansson! She was wonderful in this! So many perfect lines, just a movie I'd like to enjoy over and over! And though it seems like it would not be appropriate, having Hitler as an imaginary friend for JoJo works out hilariously, mostly due to the amazing performance of Taika Waititi! What a wonderful movie!""Let everything happen to you / Beauty and terror / Just keep going / No feeling is final.""

JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,2/10,"Given the polarisation of opinion about Jojo Rabbit (2019), it would be so much easier not to write this review at all. However, it is incumbent on me to explain why this movie is one of the worst I have seen in years.The trailer captures the narrative essence of this war comedy drama. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year old German boy who aspires to be a Nazi killing-machine but his Hitler Youth camp squad nickname him Rabbit because he runs away when ordered to kill one. When he finds Jewish teenager Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) sheltered in the attic he has the chance to betray her in service of the Fuhrer, but his conscience comes into play.This narrative arc is grounded in a predictable coming of age tale. A magical fantasy device frames the story wherein Jojo has an imaginary friend that only he can see, a campy goofball version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who urges him to betray Elsa. With the Allied armies closing in, the German war effort enters its dying days and Jojo must confront Nazi lies.Whether one thinks this film is a comedy or travesty is entirely subjective. Many will laugh at a puerile script delivered in gratingly mangled German accents with incongruous contemporary phrasing. Others may enjoy non-stop dead-pan exchanges, such as Elsa asking ""what am I?"", with Jojo answering ""a Jew"", to which Elsa replies ""Gesundheit"". Or when a female commandant (Rebel Wilson) tells Nazi girls it's a privilege to serve German soldiers: she has borne eighteen children already so ""it's a great time to be a girl"". Some will even think Jojo's cartoonish Hitler is a credibly funny representation of evil, perhaps unaware of the all-time satirical classic: the goose-stepping John Cleese and his ""don't mention the war"" skit. Where Cleese had surgical control of his mockery, Jojo's Hitler sprays cheap one-liners that are cringingly unfunny.It is argued that half of today's generation know very little about Hitler, Nazism, and the Holocaust, so films like this potentially alert us to the dangers of extreme politics. Jojo Rabbit may have worked had it opted for clarity or gravity of purpose; its stellar cast make little difference. It is a mashup of so many genres that any meaningful message is lost, and all is sacrificed to low brow gags. Even the film's most serious moments struggle for respect under the shadow of slapstick, kitsch, and the vain attempt to use stand-up comedy to portray humanity's darkest time. With a climax that mocked my staying power, this film is, at best, original in conception but a misfire in execution."
JOJO RABBIT,6 June 2020,7/10,"There's often a fine line' between wisdom and intelligence; as the saying goes, intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit, and wisdom is knowing that you don't put it in a fruit salad. It's often more complicated than that, of course. It's a line that many artists have tried to tread over the years; when they get it right the result can be transformative. Get it wrong and it's at best embarrassing, at worst offensive and inflammatory. Eminem springs to mind as someone whose talent unfettered by wisdom leads him to get it wrong more often than he gets it right.In that context it seems clear to most intelligent people that there really isn't - or shouldn't - be any topic about which it's wrong to make a joke. Wisdom is knowing when to make a joke and when not to do so; and if so, which joke is appropriate in the circumstances. Ricky Gervais (and other comedians) trumpet freedom of speech tiresomely and repeatedly, illustrating their point with controversial jokes as demonstrating the right to offend. What he so often gets wrong is that said jokes are usually not very funny; and offence for the sake offence just isn't wise or helpful for anyone.Which brings us to Jojo Rabbit; a light-hearted comedy about a young boy in Nazi Germany, joining the Hitler Youth who has an imaginary best friend. Hitler. Clearly this could go very badly wrong, and it's to writer-director Taika Waititi's credit that he gives himself the role of imaginary-friend Hitler; as a part-Jewish man, it seems fair that if he's going to make this film, he should be the one to take on that role.It's a mostly comedic, childish Hitler to be sure; but it's still Hitler, occasionally lapsing into the more familiar incarnation of the man we've all come to recognise. Waititi knows comedy, of course; he has a capacity to wring something sweet and funny out of almost anything, a capacity that's on display in this film. The interactions between the boy and Hitler are funny; and the supporting cast of seasoned comedy actors support well, drawing some richly comedic moments out of much of the film. Especially outstanding is Thomasin McKenzie as the Jewish girl hiding in the boy's attic; the boy lives with his mother alone. His sister passed away before the start of the film, his single mother is Scarlett Johansson, in a role that doesn't quite seem properly fleshed out for an actor of her talents.The first hour zips by, the comedy startling and wise, provoking thought and driving plot; it looks beautiful too. The colours are vibrant throughout, a stark contrast to the usual drabness associated with depictions of wartime Germany and a bold choice; red is everywhere, inescapable and relentless. Around the time we reach the hour mark, the film stutters; the plot keeps moving, but the comedy starts to seem tired, the concept that felt provocative now just feels a little dull. The payoff of the prevalence of the colour red - which should be the film's emotional peak - passed almost unnoticed to me.All of which left me time to ponder; yes, of course, there were 'good Germans' in wartime Germany. We have many true stories of people who took enormous risks with their own safety to save lives, but the reality was as it always is - the majority were either actively supportive of the regime, or complicit by their silence and passivity. That all Germans here are comedic to greater or lesser degrees starts to feel like glossing over the inconvenient truth that many had blood on their hands; as all we who pay little attention to latent or overt racism, sexism and other prejudices remain and continue to be supportive of it by our inaction or active participation. There are few enough stories that tell these truths - unless, of course, we switch on our news channels and find even a small part of ourselves thinking, 'Don't all lives matter?'.JoJo Rabbit has things to commend it, but it over-reaches itself; it would be better served as a tight, punchy 45 minutes. In over-reaching, it accidentally gives space to reflect on the film's weaknesses - and our own."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,7/10,Weird thought to place Hitler as a hero. But maybe thats make the movie interesting for the audience. No more comment.
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,7/10,"Yes, it is rude and raw and pushes boundaries. It was smart of the producers to enlist Hollywood favorites to star in it, no bad press for the content. We laughed a few times. Not the best movie but it was funny, no rules, rollercoaster ride. Language was a bit much - hate to see kids cuss like that."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,1/10,What sort of clown thought this was a great idea. Hollowwood proving it is great at making awful movies or great movies for morons
JOJO RABBIT,27 April 2020,9/10,"Pairing a preteen Nazi with imaginary best pal Adolf Hitler sounds like egregious cinematic overreach, but the wonderful ""Jojo Rabbit"" proves as improbably enthralling as moviemaking can get.Set in the wind-down of World War II, we follow the youthful zealotry of Johannes ""Jojo Rabbit"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), a lad infatuated with Nazi iconography. To bolster his machismo in the pursuit of influence, he feeds his head propaganda, and instructs it to supplant his departed father with das Führer.Sharing this plot line at the water cooler elicits very real bafflement. Yet Taika Waititi's film is as tender as it is tack-sharp. ""Jojo Rabbit"" takes fascism to the woodshed and holds a mirror to its inane pervasiveness. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!) WATCHED IT? THEN WATCHLIST: ""Blazing Saddles (1974),"" ""Stadium Anthems (2018),"" ""Knives Out (2019)."""
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,8/10,"There are great moments of dark satire (see the training camp), but it's the more intimate scenes (some funny, some poignant, some both) of developing relationships that carry the film-that of JoJo and Adolf (a quirky friendship gets ugly as JoJo grows-see Adolf's anger in the kitchen), Elsa (McKenzie is excellent), and Rosie (see the riverside talk) respectively, and even that of Elsa and Rosie (see the cupboard convo). So the climactic battle felt out of place, but the dance after was perfect."
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,10/10,"One of the few much awaited 2019's movies I didn't get to see before making my ""Top 10 of the year"" lists, but boy was it sure to end up there. ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a beautiful blend of dark and inventive satire, sweet and dear themes of childhood, romance and parenting & hilariously wacky comedy, as well as another great addition to Taika Waititi's successful and heartful filmography.I think it's fair to say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a brave movie, it hits the nail right on the head by clothing the controversial nazi themes in a creative anti-hate satire - and #@%k those critics who saw something else, I wholeheartedly disagree that ""the terrible truth gets buried in this movie"".You kinda see where most of the story will go & all the inevitabilities, but it's well tailored, dynamic and very enjoyable. Waititi orchestrates the whole concept gloriously well. The entire cast provides lively and awesome performances, Roman Griffin Davis shines in what could be one of the best child actor performances, Scarlett Johanson and Sam Rockwell amused me endlessly, Taika Waititi himself always knows exactly what he's doing, and, fact is, nothing but props to the whole cast. Pacing's even, action's awesome & the story provides a good chance that you'll both laugh and cry. On a side note, I was very mistaken by thinking all this time that Taika Waititi wrote the story himself, little did I know it's actually based on a novel. Every aesthetical value of ""Jojo Rabbit"" adds to it greatly, the production design is all thought through to the detail, cinematography's solid & so is original score along with the soundtrack, from which three songs have already been added to my playlists.""Jojo Rabbit"" is an emotional drama while also being a hilarious and sweet comedy, and, surely, it's one of the better satire examples in filmmaking. It felt like falling somewhere between a 9 and a 10, but then they ended it with my favorite David Bowie song, and, well, that does it. My rating: 10/10."

JOJO RABBIT,25 March 2020,9/10,"The villain of history is the treasure of producing black humor. The absurd and funny lines are ironic and extremely evil. The most powerful accent is laid out in a light rhythm. The playful childishness and serious reality switch back and forth. Pleasure is still sad; the settings of positive characters such as mom and Captain K are important, and the core is actually the same as all World War II movies: hope! Hope that justice will eventually win"
JOJO RABBIT,26 September 2020,7/10,"Of all the World War II-era films we've seen in recent history, none have been done in the vein of Taika Waititi's 'Jojo Rabbit.'As one would expect from Waititi, 'Rabbit' is infused with different forms of humor, from tongue-in-cheek to ironic humor and, of course, plenty of well-deserved digs at the common enemy of that time period. The young Roman Griffin Davis does an admirable job as the titular character, whose scrawny self is pitiful and easy to root for as he undergoes a metamorphosis while many around him are brainwashed and blind. Here, ScarJo does a good job breaking the mold of her recent cringe-worthy roles (see 'Marriage Story'), as she delivers a memorable performance as young Jojo's mother. And Waititi's portrayal of an imaginary, eccentrically embarrassing Hitler is hard to ignore.As for the rest of the film, it's hard not to see similarities with Wes Anderson efforts, particularly 'Moonrise Kingdom.' Perhaps Waititi is paying homage to Anderson, or maybe it's a coincidence. Whatever it is, 'Rabbit' is still unique, as it takes us on an emotional roller coaster through all the satirical twists and turns.'Jojo Rabbit' is probably too mainstream to be considered a cult hit, but that's okay. It should be appreciated for what it is, and nothing more."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,10/10,A lot of people are put off by the fact that it involved comedy and nazis but this film is so much more than that. You'll laugh and cry and be grateful that this is a movie.
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,10/10,Jojo Rabbit is one of those films where you go because of all of the great things about it and it ends up being one of the best films ever.
JOJO RABBIT,20 November 2019,7/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a smart, original and daring dark comedy. Actor Roman Griffin Davis is destined to become a bonafide star with a performance like this one.
.
In this comedic satire, a young boy in Hitler's army finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.
.
To mention that ""Jojo Rabbit"" won't be for everyone is an understatement. This Nazi-mocking satire tests all boundaries of what is right and wrong but with its heart in the right place. Writer, director and actor Taika Waititi has made a genuine film that will divide its audience, but ultimately have them thinking of ""Jojo Rabbit"" after the credits have rolled. The all-star cast is superb and hilarious. An overall exciting movie-going experience."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,6/10,"I have mixed feelings.. Certainly, it is a well made movie, with great aesthetic choices, interesting scenes and good characters (Yorki). And while the topic is far from appealing in the general sense! this movie suffers from being a copycat attempt at what Wes Anderson does very well.. telling a story of a bunch of characters bound together by circumstance.I understand the message and feeling, as well as the character arc. I just don't think it was well made. Yorki was easily the best character (followed by K), and I wished everyone else was like that. They probably seem better because they aren't in it for long stretches of time.
Some scenes just don't mesh together too, there are ""boring"" interactions that can be skipped without affecting the plot, and some characters just don't work.You can tell Taika is still learning or searching for his own style. Learning to write / adapt.. specially because the book is completely different (in tone)."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a movie that offers a complete different perspective on war. It is the finest example of satire in latest years, even if it mock tragic events it manages still to be respectful. Instead of showing a realistic view World War 2, with gruesome scenes, director Taika Waititi decided to take a colorful direction, with close to no explicit violence. Little by little becomes darker, showing the tragedy of the war and how much sufference this can bring.Photography is amazing, I like when directors go unconventional, and for some aspects the style reminded me a lot ""Grand Hotel Budapest"" and ""The King's Speech"", two movies that I have loved. Cast made an excellent job, especially Roman Davis, that was always on point with his german accent. I really liked the Adolf Hitler parody, very few interpretations were able to make me sincerely laugh so much. It is a nice example of comedy and a lot of people in the cinematography world, should take note.Beware, Jojo Rabbit might seem a colorful and funny movie, but it has really important and inspiring message. It made me think a lot about war and his injustices, Together with the italian movie ""La Vita è Bella"", are the most beautiful war movie ever made. A real gem, and it deserved every single prize that won."
JOJO RABBIT,27 August 2020,7/10,"I thought this was the movie to win the oscar, ti is really good, also has a lot of good performances, the boy and Taika Waititi are to highlight."
JOJO RABBIT,3 March 2020,7/10,"It's one of those movies where there are many topics and genres tackled all at once but it manages to stay balanced and entertaining. The comedy is obviously the main driver but there are lots of other positives too. Two things that stood out to me were, a kid's struggle to belong something and a mother's struggle to do the right things for her family. Oddly enough one of the side characters completely steals the spotlight.Jojo, a ten-year-old ""nazi"", is going through a rough time in his life as the ww2 is coming to an end."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"A modern masterpiece starting off the year perfectly that encompasses so many genres, it's certainly unique! Based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens and set in World War II, we follow a 10 year old boy named Jojo who is growing up under the world wide influence of Nazi control, speaks to Hitler quite often in his imagination and ultimately just wants to be part of a group. He finds out his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their home and all sorts of conflicted feelings start occurring. What follows is the emotional growth and realisation that Jojo is not a nazi; he does not belong under an evil dictatorship and there is much more to living life positively than obsessing over war. Writer/Director Taika Waititi (What We Do In The Shadows, The Hunt for the Wilder People) has created his finest work through sheer bravery in a bittersweet comedy/drama taking place in a horrendous historical event. The horror of the nazi regime during World War II is explored with some devastating sequences, including an incredibly intense home visit from the gestapo led by a surprisingly menacing Stephen Merchant on superb form to a disturbing revelation at the beginning of the third act. All the while however, the overall effect feels positive and it's a film that completely celebrates humanity's good side in the face of segregation and nihilism. But it's not all dramatic; it's a film with pure glowing heart and huge belly laughs also from an incredible cast. Waititi casts himself as Jojo's imaginary friend, Adolf, and simultaneously blends the evil dictatorship as well as great humour delightfully poking fun at the Nazis through a 10 year olds perspective and adding a wonderfully weird fantastical element to the story. Sam Rockwell's Captain K and his buddy Finkel played by Alfie Allen are incredible every time theyre on screen and add much also to the pathos of the story (their battle image is just fantastic!)Scarlett Johannson is a real stand out here; her role as Jojo's mother is so important and she is truly the joyful heart and soul to the film. Thomasin McKensie is great as the young girl living with Jojo and his mother and has some wonderful pieces of dialogue that really highlight the ridiculousness of discrimination. Of course a big shout out has to be made to Roman Griffin Davis in the lead role who is absolutely phenomenal; not only is his comic timing perfect but he also keeps the heart strings tugging at certain emotional junctures of the story. Shoes play a powerful role here and are part of one of the most effective visual narrative progressions that I can ever remember seeing. The soundtrack is hugely memorable, the production design is spot on, the tonal shifts work completely to create a hugely entertaining film. The seriousness of the subject matter is always present and ultimately makes a fantastic message of sustaining a positive attitude and individuality even more so than ever and ensure as a species that these horrific events can never be repeated again. I really loved it and it should be seen by everyone. Oh and Jojo's best buddy Yorki played by Archie Yates is just brilliant!"
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,8/10,"A little German Boy (Roman Griffin Davis) whose Hero is Adolph Hitler finds a Beautiful Jewish Girl (Thomasin Mckenzie) living in His Attic. Being a Loyal Hitler Youth he initially wants to turn her in But as it turns out, she is there with the permission of his Lovely Mother (Scarlett Johansson), who is working with the Underground. The boy and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) are set to attend a Hitler Youth Camp which is run by Captain K (Sam Rockwell) and his loyal asst Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson). JOJO is asked at the Camp to Kill a Rabbit to prove himself worthy to be a Nazi Soldier, but when he refuses' gets branded as a coward. Jojo after stewing a while tries again but his Face is scarred by a stray Hand Grenade. All the While Jojo talks to his imaginary Hitler played by the Writer Director(Taiki Waititi) of the Movie. Bunch of Heil Hitlers, Heil Hitlers in their kinda made me think of the TV show Hogans Heroes. His Mother is Hanged for Treason leaving him alone in the house with Elsa and he is afraid she will leave when the war ends. A visit from the Gestapo almost gets Elsa caught but she out foxes them ! The interaction between the Young characters are my favorite scenes in the Movie. The older characters pull off alot of clever one liners and zany movements that keep you giggling. Refreshingly Different and Unique Script. Liked it enough to light the Box Office twice now."
JOJO RABBIT,7 May 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a comedy that focuses on some serious topics, those topics being World War 2 and Adolf Hitler. Having a comedy that is based on Nazis and their point of views may be controversial, but I think that it's important to try to bring out laughter or happiness to such a serious topic. My beliefs are that you can make comedy out of anything, no matter how serious or controversial it is. Jojo Rabbit masters the comedy, as I think that silly comedy is the right way to go for something like this. Silly comedy can come off stupid and/or childish, but Jojo rabbit's comedy can make anyone laugh (only if the viewer have a sense of humor).The plot itself is rather original in my opinion; a young manipulated Nazi boy who meets a Jewish girl hiding in his house who then form a unique relationship. The plot can be done as a drama, but I think it's best done as a comedy, as there's so much more opportunities you can do. Although this movie is really goofy, it has extremely mature themes, like brainwashing, death of a loved one, and hate. The scene of Jojo realizing that is mother is dead is extremely sad, and this theme is super important as it's a wake up call that this is Nazi Germany after all. Jojo rabbit also focuses on some very important parts in World War 2 history that not a lot of movies touch on. For example, the manipulation of young children in Nazi Germany and propaganda. So although Saving Private Ryan is a history lesson, Jojo Rabbit equally brings something new to the table.Adolf Hitler in this movie is extremely well done because this isn't actually Adolf Hitler, but it's Adolf Hitler portrayed in the mind of a kid. So even though Adolf Hitler probably isn't a funny guy in real life, this version is hilarious. Rebel Wilson, Taika Waititi, and Sam Rockwell are the main source of comedy in this movie, and the delivery of the lines were done so well, and I think that there should be more appreciation to the actors. Roman Griffin Davis did a great job too; when children cry in movies, it feels fake and forced, but Roman Griffin Davis completely sold it. The characters and comedy were written so well in Jojo Rabbit that Taika Waititi is already in the Hall of Fame for comedy in my eyes. He played as Korg in Thor: Ragnarok and Adolf Hitler in Jojo Rabbit, so he definitely has plenty of potential.Jojo Rabbit is a must watch if you enjoy comedy at the slightest bit. Jojo Rabbit is what comedy should be; it should make you laugh and it should make you cry while telling an amazing story. At first I thought Jojo Rabbit was going to be stupid by the looks of it, but I'm so glad I've seen it, as it truly made my day."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,7/10,"This feels like a breath of fresh air... but only because a lot of the comedies recently have been bad. This movie is acted well, albeit with some cliches that were a bit annoying. But it's a good story with compelling characters, and Taika does a brilliant job as an exuberant and fun imaginary friend."
JOJO RABBIT,2 August 2020,6/10,"The movie was not one I was looking forward to. I could tell it was in bad taste most of the time, but was at least willing to give it a shot.
It was not terrible. BUT...it was not great.
BUt it kinda had some humor I approved of at times, but then there was the ever present tragic and disgusting reality of the germans and their crummy ways.
This was not the Producers at all. But the kids stole the show fer sure.
Give it a shot if you like, form your own opinion. For me, it was fairly unrealistic, and obviously meant to be that way a little bit. 6/10 for the bits of comedy, plus kicking Hitler in out the window ( not a spoiler, it was in previews)"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2021,6/10,"Jojo is a keen Hitler Youth member in World War 2 until he comes across a teenage Jewish girl who is being hidden in their attic by his mother. While dealing with his imaginary friend, an alternative Adolf Hitler, he starts to question his beliefs.Quirky comedy by Taika Waititi, who also stars as Adolf Hitler, underlining the seriousness of the situation for Jews during the war whilst largely treating the German characters as comical. Roman Griffin Davis is the innocent Jojo."

12A
director: Taika Watiti
starring: Roman griffin Davis, Scarlett johanson,Rebel Wilson,Stephan Merchant,Thomasin Mckenzie,Taika Watiti,Archie Yates, Sam Rockwell etc.overall rating 89/100Jojo rabbit was truly excellent. something different. And offers a perfect blend of humour and drama in a clever and thoughtful way lets talk about this deeper.My first positives would be the films humour and blending genres and tackling sensitive topics. The film was absolutely hilarious. The fact that it was a satire on nazi germany and hitler made the film more funny as you felt like you shouldn't laugh but thats what the film wants you to do. Rebel wilson got given fantastic material here and was fantastic and hilarious, her wit and sarcasm was fantastic to watch and she made me laugh almost every time she was on screen. But it also blended the genres of drama and comedy as well, with an equal amount of humour and serious/ emotional scenes so this was handled very well, including tackling sensitive topics such as the attitudes towards jews,public hangings and the harsh brutalities of war.Next the film's performances were great, with key standouts and great chemistry between characters. The whole cast did fantastic performance, with both the humour and the drama showing true versatility with everyone. My key standouts were definitely Roman Griffin Davis and Scarlett johansson. Who had excellent chemistry as a mother and son, who have conflicting views but a deep love for one another. Scarlet did a phenomenal job of being the voice of reason for peace for the war and making her son change her mind on the nazis and the jews, she was a very believable motherly character leading to some heartwarming scenes. And Roman did a surprisingly versatile and deep performance for such a young actor and i was very impressed, His portrayal of a young nazi being brainwashed into supporting the nazis was excellently executed.My only negative that bought down the film slightly would be its slight tonal inconsistencies in the final act. The film slightly overused hitler as a imaginary friend for Roman's character. It worked at first but then got slightly overused and irritating towards the end. And the films occasional use of comedy when there was conflict in the war towards the end effected the impact of some scenes making the narrative slightly clunky.My final two positives would be its excellent script and fantastic character arc for Roman Griffin Davis. The films script felt very modern and left a big impact on me. The characters saying that everyone is human and we are not all that different is very important in todays society and is a good message to spread for people. Finally Roman griffin Davies character arc throughout the film was excellent. To go from a brainwashed nazi kid to forming a connection with a jew and realising that they aren't any different to anyone else thanks to his mum was powerfully done. I respect the amount of depth to his character and his change of attitude towards what is right and wrong.Overall Jojo rabbit is a powerfully acted thoughtful movie blending comedy and drama almost perfectly with it just losing its steam towards the end. But still a fantastic movie."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2021,5/10,"This movie has many fine points across the board. However, it does make you feel uncomfortable during the satiric or comedic moments. Should you be enjoying comedy centred around a group and person responsible for the largest loss of life in history and is it insensitive doing so. Perhaps those from generations more distant from these events can put it behind them and enjoy. However, for others it is still a very sensitive issue."
JOJO RABBIT,17 July 2021,6/10,"Taika definitely knows how to organise a comical, devastating and original satire. But it's unfortunately not as replayable as the critics state. What this fictional comedy should be remembered for is the fact that it's not just graphic full-on depictions of battles in WWII; the witty characters and touching portrayals of tale are delightful and memorable.Roman Griffin Davis and Taika Waititi fulfil delivering humorous characters throughout the entire runtime of the film. Jojo Rabbit is fair and funny before it leads to an attaching tragedy concluding with laughs and heart. Teens will love how the story can represent both multiple heavy and light-hearted moments, but is also engaging and worth a watch.What ruins the story is how increasingly lumpy and slow it moves. It's a charming satire with imagination and friendship. Jojo Rabbit isn't precisely what you were anticipating for, but is enough for a touch, a giggle and wacky fiction.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,2/10,No where as good as it wants to be trailer was great sadly movie is not
JOJO RABBIT,1 April 2020,8/10,"In the lens of Taiga Viditi, there are not only the colorful world of spring, but also the magnificent and wonderful fantasy. If the former promotes the development of the plot as a hint of emotion and rhythm, then the latter is metaphor and symbol. Freedom Kingdom, the strangeness and indifference of Taiga films made me choose to examine the latter topic, and the reason why I juxtaposed ""composition art"" and ""metaphorical symbols"" is based on this understanding-Taiga In addition to the pure expressiveness of visual aesthetics, composition art has another connotation of metaphorical symbols, which is also its poetic nature.However, I think the charm of metaphor lies in its openness. Everyone can put forward different views. In the metaphorical world and the symbolic kingdom, there is no right or wrong, but only cleverness and beauty. However, the standard of this judgment is extremely Personalized, just as the beauty of the mirror is not that it reflects much of the world, but that everyone can reach its own ideal state through it, so unmistakable instructions and well-founded arguments are just a thousand paths. This article does not intend to enumerate the path taken by the author, but only provides a number of pregnant intersections for visitors to choose and follow. In other words, the author thinks that the image is the image. The value of the metaphor itself is far higher than its interpretable meaning. The gift that has not been opened is the most potential and therefore the best."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2020,8/10,"Well worth watchingIt's a satire,drama, comedy all rolled into one good movieExcellent performances all round especially from the young actors,Davis & McKenzie"
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,1/10,"I'm sorry, what about this movie warranted any nominations? I totally didn't get the Hitler ""imaginary friend"" thing. Taika Waititi thinks he's funny but I think he's trying too hard and he's laughing at himself too much. There's really a fine line when it comes to comedy and he's just not it.The whole movie just seemed incredibly irreverent and disrespectful to the war and all the people who died in it. I wasn't learning anything either.I would consider it one of the worst movies of the year."
JOJO RABBIT,22 August 2020,8/10,"Sat down and did not know what to expect, a movie for kids? Not! But a movie that reaches out and touches you through the eyes of a young German boy during World War 2 ."
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,7/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a new war drama comedy directed, written and partly produced by Taika Waititi, the director of Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor: Ragnarok.The film is set in Germany where Adolf Hitler has the power. The young Yo-yo (Roman Griffin Davis) is raised under Nazi policies with the propaganda that Hitler and his Third Reich are the saviors of the world and that the Jewish people are responsible for the world's problems.
Jojo is a bit lonely and insecure about himself and doesn't dare too much. For this reason, he is soon nicknamed Jojo Rabbit. Because of his loneliness and his head filled with propaganda, Jojo sees an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) as his imaginary friend who advises him how to live his life.
When Jojo discovers that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is helping a Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) go into hiding in their attic, Jojo faces a difficult choice. He can report his own mother and Jewish girl to the Nazi Board, just as his imaginary friend advises him to do, or to keep his mother's secret secret until the war is over.With this film, Taika Waititi shows well how something like propaganda can make someone change his mind and then completely of young children. He does this in a way that he knows how to bring a good mix of comedy and drama. The film also has the message that you have to make your own choices in your life without the influence of someone else. The film also shows well that you don't have to judge anyone by their appearance or belief, but you first have to get to know the person before you can judge how someone actually is. Taika Waititi has also written the film in a respectful way, but still manages to ridicule Nazi ideas in a good way.The film also has an appropriate film set that comes across as Germany during the Nazi regime where the walls were hung and people were walking around with propaganda to portray their leader in a positive way. The film shows so well how propaganda blinded Hitler's followers. The horrible things that happened thanks to Hitler are portrayed in a nice colorful way in the film, while it was actually about idiotic things.The acting is also done well in the film. This is only the first acting work of Roman Griffin Davis and he already performs his role in a good and credible way. The other starting actor Archie Yates also plays his role well. The two young actors look nice together. Scarlett Johansson also performs well when Jojo shows his mother how her son changes her lifestyle through Nazi propaganda. Taika Waititi also does it comically as an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler."
JOJO RABBIT,2 September 2020,3/10,"I stay away from critiques regarding freedom of speech.
If the world had a proper education of the World between 1931-1945 in terms of the Axis Powers and their acts of atrocity and not just the names of a few battles and death camps...I'd give the thumbs up perhaps. The fact that the general public is relatively ignorant regarding WWII and the atrocities, I find this film with the mere background of ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" to be inappropriate.
It's clearly a mockery of the NAZI regime and the Aryan Race, but a mockery of something that was renowned for efficiency in military matters and Genocide on an Industrial organized scale, without that knowledge isn't a mockery."
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,7/10,"It's excellent to see a film that is really unique in concept and delivery, especially when it contains great dark humour, which seems rare today.The film has a good story and some of the acting is excellent in it. There are plenty of twists and turns and there is constant humour with some great characters.I felt at times it was a little slow and some of the humour a little obvious and at times childish but still a film very much worth seeing."
JOJO RABBIT,6 November 2019,7/10,Talking about politics with good sense of humor! The kid actors are very good & adorable.
JOJO RABBIT,17 July 2020,7/10,"I didn't think this was going to be a good movie when I read the synopsis beforehand, but It was actually good. The plot was intriguing throughout and the comedy was enjoyable and wasn't that over the top like I expected. The accents weren't that impressive, but it didn't really matter as the movie was in English anyway so logic was out of the window. It probably it wasn't historically accurate as well, but I didn't mind that because the movie was just enjoyable and it was refreshing watching a movie that tries to be unique."
JOJO RABBIT,29 April 2020,8/10,"First off, when you think about the thematic concept of this film, you wonder about the very specific tone it requires for the comedy to work, without affecting and unbalancing the drama, since even nowadays can still be quite a touchy subject matter. Yet, Taika Watiti's magnificent and well-deserved Oscar winning screenplay adapted from a novel, goes to show what a great thing it is to still have creativity put into heartfelt cinema in a cultural world where remakes, reboots and reunions seem to be the general agenda to commercialize. Creativity even in a thematic field where many have come and gone on numerous ocassions, where is hard to tell stories that can genuinely make one laugh within the somber context of the situation, without taking any seriousness of it, and that's where the story is successful, where one can cherish the proper execution, where every single actor played their parts extremely well that helped the story flow so smoothly.Jojo Rabbit has incredibly well-written characters which is where it resides its clue to function as a dark comedy, given its disconcerting times.
Jojo's interactions with his mother are quite clever, and can leave an impression on you; and scenes with Elsa have such a comedic weight that gives you such joy that you're instantly reminded that usually these kinds of stories don't end up too well.I believe this film will be remembered for years to come and it will come to be even more appreciated than it is today. This is one that I can watch over and over again."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,6/10,Nicely directed WW2 satire with good child actors and some funny moments. Manages to balance humor and seriousness fairly well.6 out of 10!
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2021,6/10,"Watched on blu-ray.I don't own the blu-ray, my sister does and she wanted to watch it with me, so you know what that means... New Barbie review coming soon! It also meant re-watching Jojo rabbit, a film that only gets worse the more you see it, I didn't even love it the first time round.The story is cute, I don't find it emotional or heartbreaking like some do but it's entertaining enough. I enjoy the performances, although none of them are great. As much as I love Thomasin McKenzie I think her line delivery is poor at times and her kiwi accent slips out occasionally. Other than that her performance is pretty great, physically she's got it down. There's a lot of very noticeable greenscreen which took me out of the film, looking out any window is distracting and the emotional moment with Jojo and Elsa watching the war rage from Inge's bedroom doesn't work for me as a result of this. The final scene is cute, but Jojo telling Elsa the German's won the war doesn't make sense she could just come out and check for herself. She didn't have to be in the cupboard as she was posing as Inge at this point and if the German's won or not what was stopping her from coming out of the cupboard to see for herself, she was walking around the house when Germany was under German control in the previous scene. When Rosie runs ash on her face her lipstick stays exactly the same. Until the final act each time a bomb or grenade went off it didn't leave any damage on the surroundings. And finally quite a lot of the jokes fall flat for me, overall I'd still say it's funny though, I batmn'ed.There are some good things too. I like the cinematography, it feels a bit like a bad Wes Anderson. Elsa and Jojo have a cute relationship and so is captain Klenzendorf's with Freddy Finkel. I like the way propaganda is presented. I really like how the complications and repercussions of war are handled and I love German David Bowie. If only the rest of the music was as good as that song.Musically, some tracks are interesting. I enjoyed the use of a choir and many simple drums fills, both worked effective individually and in unison. This is thrown to the side after the whimsical childlike dream perception of war is broken, as a substitute we get a cheesy manipulative stock war movie score. We get the emotional strings and piano in minor key. The film insists that this moment is sad and this moment is happy without earning it. There are exceptions to this but it's ten to one."
JOJO RABBIT,14 May 2020,8/10,"I actually liked how they portrayed the events from the perspective of a child. Jojo has a great narrative arc, he evolves a lot throughout the movie, especially after the death of his mother, but also through his complex relationship with Elsa. Sometimes he has a great difficulty to guess if he is feeling loved or friendship towards her, it really portrays the bunch of emotions that a young adolescent like him could go through.Of course, Taika Waititi is an excellent director that has the talent to capture comic scenes in his movie and to write interesting and likable characters.Finally, this movie is probably not as historically accurate as you would like and can be very divisive due to his type of humor, but give it a try."
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,9/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a movie I wasn't particularly excited to see, but one I went to see because my cousin, a strapping young gentleman, wanted to see. And for the first half, I could tell he was enjoying it. He was laughing hard at the slapstick comedy, the silly antics of one of the silliest men alive, Adolf Hitler, and at the clever little lines that the film liked to throw at its audience. I, however, wasn't enjoying what I was seeing. I liked the concept, but the humor just wasn't clicking with me. And then, something changed.""Jojo Rabbit"" is one of my favorite films of 2019, without a doubt. At around the halfway mark, it became, for me, one of the most beautiful and hopeful, but also tragic, films I've seen. A fantastical surrealistic masterpiece, ""Jojo Rabbit"" isn't meant to be taken too seriously. Perhaps that's because the film takes place from the eyes of a child, but regardless, it helps if you approach this movie as more of a fantasy than a drama.I don't want to get into plot specifics or spoilers, and that's more out of laziness because I just drank a full glass of Woodford Reserve bourbon whiskey and I'd like to play some Death Stranding before going to bed, alone. Regardless, however, I would like to talk specifically about what made this movie resonate with me personally, and why I believe it is one of the best films of the year: ""Jojo Rabbit"" deals with distressing topics, which is obvious given the subject matter and plot synopsis, but also with relateable topics from young love and romance to the notion that often in this life we are born one thing, and then die another based on the choices that we make along the way.There are scenes of pure beauty that had me awestruck and feeling butterflies in my stomach. There are sequences of crippling sadness that had me gasp and hold back tears. And there are sections of the film that are so intense I was literally holding my breath, my heart racing. God, I just wish I as back in the theatre right now reliving this film. Certain scenes will be burnt into my memory for as long as I live because of how gorgeous, sensual, powerful, and inspiring they were. Other scenes will have my awake at night because of how suspenseful and scary they were to watch unfold. ""Jojo Rabbit"" has it all, and I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this film.Now no movie is perfect, and with great power comes great responsibility; this movie is no exception. There were times where I felt like the lighthearted tone was unnecessary and even inappropriate, especially during the last half of the film when certain things were going down. I didn't mind the tone in the beginning, but towards the end when things are getting very serious and intense, I thought the jokiness of certain scenes could have been left out to make the goings on more impactful. However, once I took the film as the fantasy it is meant to be, this didn't bother me too much.Part coming of age and loss of innocence, part fantasy, and part romance, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is an absolutely beautiful film, and one I'm so happy I went to see. Please, my words do not, and can not, do this movie justice. Go see it.9/10"
JOJO RABBIT,10 December 2020,8/10,"Unusual film for several reasons, primarily the theme of the film, the way of talking as well as the mixing of genres or tones in the film. The quality of the film is mostly carried by the young lead actor for whom this is the first role in life and a masterful script that plays with your feelings throughout the film. A wide range of emotions, from laughter to tears, the film reminded me a lot of Life is Beautiful. Personally, the more serious part of the film was better and I preferred it, and we mostly have that in the second half of the film. I appreciate the director for the style he has kept and we can clearly see his signature."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,8/10,"At a time when Hollywood pumps out so much clumsy heavy-handed politicised PC pseudo moralistic gumpf along comes Jojo Rabbit & I for one am filled with hope for the movie industry once again.Beautifully told, intelligent, perfectly cast & well written; ladies & gentlemen, I give you Jojo Rabbit."
JOJO RABBIT,1 May 2020,9/10,"It's very unusual movie. Often films about WWII can be divide in two groups: 1) serious, big films with moral, tradegy and drama; 2) comedies with a little bit stupid humour and a lot of gags. This film isn't in that groups. Firstly, the plot is genius, WWII shown by eyes of 10-years boy, who believes in Hitler like in God. He must choose: his belief or his friendship and love, and this cathes you all. Also drama and comedy alternate each other, it creates movement of plot. Secondly, the cast is great, I can say it about both generation of actors and actresses. Young cast did all performance well, especially the main character. Adult cast is brilliant of film. Sam Rockwell is the king of supporting role, and with Rebel Wilson they became stars of film. Scarlett Johansson is one of the best actress of our days, she played one the difficult role in this film - mother of Jojo. Of course, I must say about Hitler of Taika Waititi, you should watch it, it's very funny.
So, it's good film that found the balance between comedy and tragedy."
JOJO RABBIT,11 April 2021,5/10,"This is highly stylized movie and if you like fantastical realism, you might like this. Because it was such a quirky, fantastical style, it failed to pull me into any real emotions, but for the genre, I think it was probably well done. I would have preferred a more serious, dramatic version of this story."
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,7/10,"I started watching ""Jojo the Rabbit"" and frowned as the first few minutes went by, but I kept on watching in hope for the better.... The last straw was when the Nazi broke the rabbit's neck .... what a gross scene ! The whole film is gross in its endeavor for comedy...Yes, ""Jojo the Rabbit"" is a Nazi satire but it certainly does not have the refinement of ""Springtime for Hitler""...."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,7/10,"I had previously reviewed Jojo Rabbit and rated it a ""1"" because of the disgusting neck-wringing bunny scene and I walked out.....I eventually decided to rewatch this movie today, which I did only from AFTER the nauseating scene..... And from that point on I thoroughly enjoyed the film.... it's funny, it's sad, it's emotional, it's thought-stirring, and sheer a joy to watch the marvelous performances of one and all.Jojo Rabbit is rightfully nominated for an Oscar Best Picture.... but it would have a better chance of winning without that nauseating bunny scene...."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2021,8/10,"It is always problematic to face a comedy about Nazism and Waititi manages it quite well, with his story (and from the point of view of) about a 10-year-old boy who enters the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) at the end of the war, his mother and a secret that she will soon discover at home.The child starts from a furious Nazism fueled by his imaginary talks with Hitler himself (perhaps the least successful of the film) in what constitutes a novel of learning and initiation.Many critics reproach that in certain sections (one of them a devastating scene) the film abandons its acid, satirical and accurate humor (including notable sequences of graphic humor), but I believe that these dark and hard moments are inescapable, necessary.However, there is more than one scene, especially a very successful one where the director achieves the coexistence of the comic with the sinister.
The period reconstruction is exquisite, very German.The performance of the child Roman Griffin Davies (character with some echoes of The Tin Drum of Schlöndorf) is huge and Scarlett Johansson is the bright mother of him."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"Jojo is a proud Hitler Youth member. He decides to go on a weekend for fellow brainwashed enthusiasts. However, after a (very funny) accident with a grenade he finds himself hospitalised. At home recovering he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. He confides this to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (!)This film is actually a comedy! An off the wall, zany and irreverant comedy that works beautifully. It was a massive gamble to make such a film in such oversensitive and 'woke' times. And it was Disney of all studios that made Jojo Rabbit! Should such a terrible period from history be depicted in such a chirpy and comical way? Should Hitler be portrayed as such a goofball within the film? YES! Whether it's Mel Brooks (who said he loved JoJo Rabbit) with The Producers and it's musical Springtime For Hitler or Joan Rivers making her controversial joke about the Holocaust on Fashion Police, humour reaches the parts that more earnest and serious pieces of 'art' can't. It forces you to laugh at whatever is the target of the joke is and then analyse why you laughed at something that you normally wouldn't see as comical.Whilst most critics have lauded the film, there are peripheral pundits who have either said that the filmmakers have gone too far (How dare they make a comedy starring Adolf Hitler?!) or that they didn't go far enough (How dare they make a film about Nazi Germany and not show the full horror of what happened?!). The Guardian hated the film which is another reason for audiences go and see this gem of a film.But, understandably, everything depicted in the film isn't just for laughs. There are plenty of gut-wrenching moments when the full horror is brought home to the characters and audience alike. These poignant sequences aren't milked for all their worth and this makes them all the more powerful and genuine. There were a couple of pivotal scenes which made me fight back tears. These scenes were played out for what they were without the whole film descending into a tissue-soaking cry-a-thon which would have cheapened and devalued the movie's content.The film also looks beautiful with set designs and a colour palate that makes Jojo Rabbit a feast for the eyes. This film is beautifully constructed. Jojo's room, the house in which he resides, the cubby hole that houses Elsa and the surrounding environs are all aesthetically pleasing and a joy to behold.Also, check out the framing. Every scene feels just as quirky, off-kilter and as warped as the narrative. Watch out for the scene on the giant steps and the later scene with it's emphasis on a character's shoes and how this motif is used later on in the film in an extremely heartbreaking but dignified and tasteful way.The soundtrack is also fantastic with The Beatles' German language version of I Wanna Hold Your Hand ('Komm, gib mir deine Hand') and Bowie's Helden leading the way. In fact, these two rather obscure (to English eyes anyway) versions of well known songs normally heard in their Mother Tongue depict the whole feel of the film- off kilter, eschew and very original.There are uniformly amazing performances by the likes of Roman Griffin Davis playing Jojo, Scarlett Johannsen as his mother, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa the Jewish hideaway and Sam Rockwell (great to see him taking more risks with his choice of roles after starring in the ultra-woke and unbearable Three Billboards). Also, look out for Stephen Merchant as a very sinister Nazi inspector. He reminded me of The Demon Headmaster. But it's director and screenwriter Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler who steals the show. Every scene that hes in is comedy gold as he depicts Hitler as a kind of bro/dude best friend to Jojo. His lines and mannerisms are laugh out loud hysterical.4 parts humour, 1 part sentiment, this film has a power that will seep into your brain during it's running time and stay with you long after the film is over. In fact my first thought on leaving the cinema was that I wanted to see it again.I feel privileged to have seen one of the best films of 2020 on Jan the 1st of this year. A cracking start to a new decade of movies."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,7/10,"I've recently read that Disney were disquited that a black comedy satirizing Nazi Germany would alienate modern audiences. I can imagine it, I suppose. One side might be offended by the mere sight of Nazi iconography - regardless of context or intent - while the other side (let's face it) has a few factions which feel attacked when a film portrays overtly Nazi or Nazi-inspired figures as evil. Disney sure has come a long way since The Führer's Face.I seem to recall, also, that people foresaw a success from Jojo Rabbit, directed by Taika Waititi, who returns to the land of quirky comedy after peppering the superhero genre with it in Thor: Ragnarok. It seems, however, that its impact was pretty lukewarm. To me, it is a shame.Jojo Rabbit does what too few modern comedies do, letting its visuals create almost as much of the humour as the satirical dialogue and performances - through editing, framing, strange title cards, and what-have-you. Almost every YouTube video essayist will cite The Cornetto Trilogy as the prime example, but Waititi also gets that a truly striking comedy will also be fun to look at. We need more than just comedians being themselves in front of a camera, lest we see more insipid Schumer vehicles à la last year's I Feel Pretty.Waititi himself plays Adolf Hitler, or at least how he appears to a young 1940's Hitler Youth lad named Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), who just doesn't know any better. This Adolf is a childish imaginary friend, because how bad could Hitler really be if most of the nation admires him?The supporting cast provides more flare than they might have done in a more mainstream film, even if we mostly know them as the modern greats, including Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson, the latter playing Jojo's single mother (the father, we're told, is serving in Italy but is rumored to be a deserter and disgrace). Stephen Merchant is an amusing choice as the leader of a Gestapo group, Rebel Wilson made me chuckle more than usual as a Hitler Youth counselor, and Thomasin McKenzie (get this) plays a Jewish girl whom Jojo eventually has to hide in his house.As I said at the top, this film might also irritate both sides of the aisle for different reasons. Someone might whine that laughing at a Holocaust comedy means you would also laugh if said historical event were to repeat itself. Someone like Armond White might wonder why the movie didn't make fun of fans of the Obama administration instead.More legitimate complaints involve the film being ""declawed"" as far as black comedy goes, and that it doesn't necessarily confront the ideology behind the Third Reich with much depth or vitriol, nor are they satisfied with its parallels to present-day political idolatry and xenophobia. Many critics feel that the comedy largely comes down to ""Hey, look, it's Hitler but he's acting all goofy"".Fortunately for Waititi, some might be offended either way (see above). And a lot of us will no doubt laugh. He's a particular type of weirdo, that Taika, successfully turning something awful and serious into something outstandingly wacky. He is funny enough in the role, too. Alas, the next Chaplin he is not. Yet."
JOJO RABBIT,29 November 2020,9/10,"Jojo rabbit is funny, interesting, heart-breaking, and memorable. The idea of creating a satirical film from the perspective of a young Nazi boy is fantastic but
Taika Waititi really brings the moving parts together. Every single actor/actress nail their roles with an especially notable performance by Scarlett, who is killing it this year.This has me signed up to see every Taika Waititi film from now on."
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,5/10,"Waititi/Cohen isn't known for making high-brow films or masterpieces. He is more of an Adam Sandler than a Hitchcock.This movie is much on the level we could expect from him.The subject matter does give the feeling that there is a certain requirement for some directors to pay their dues by making a WWII movie of a certain type, and I don't mean saving Private Ryan.The quality of the movie is - average.It is meant to be a comedy but it is really only very low-brow in its delivery.Stephen Merchant delivers the standout performance as Gestapo officer. If all of the movie was like this it might have made it. Unfortunately the worst seems are those with Waititi who is unconvincing in his mock-Hitler.Wait until you can see it for free and can skip through."
JOJO RABBIT,5 June 2021,7/10,"Nowhere near to the long-awaited dark-humored nuclear satire ever promised, Fox Searchlight's latest awards darling is an erratic, heartfelt anti-hate drama more prone to ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" and ""Life is Beautiful"" than ""The Great Dictator"" or ""The Producers.""How on earth did a Kiwi filmmaker get the green light for a studio movie focused on a lonely 10-year-old Nazi enthusiast and his imaginary friend the Führer in an era when every single supposedly controversial idea leads to cultural backslash and media outrage? New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi knows the answer.Everything dates back to 2004. After making some comedy shorts for local festivals, his short, ""Two Cars, One Night,"" went on to earn a Best Live Action Short nomination at the 2005 Academy Awards. Three years later, Waititi built some European reputation with the wry rom-com ""Eagle vs Shark,"" which gave him his first Sundance entrance at the Grand Jury Prize competition. Following a wave of short-films and TV episodes, the best-dressed helmer wrote and directed ""Boy,"" another offbeat comedy released at the AFI Fest, the Berlinale, and Sundance. Six years later, with ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople,"" he won some accolades and wider recognition; however, it was ""What We Do in the Shadows"" which changed his and his usual collaborator Jemaine Clement's careers. Highly praised among cult movie fans, this offbeat examination on vampires and society was so bloody hilarious and oddly on-point that, besides being one of the best mockumentaries ever made- its TV equivalent would be ""The Office"", -it inspired an original FX spinoff series. Now, we have to make a stop at Marvel Studios.This instant cult classic not only was the genesis of his first Best Adapted Screenplay award, but also the golden ticket to print his dynamics on a superhero flick. Bursting with colorfully polarizing reception, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" crushed box office predictions and saved the franchise by stripping Thor of his Phase One status quo and infusing Jack Kirby art style into his new and upcoming extravaganzas. Waititi succeeding at Marvel big-budget magnitudes is just another beautiful testimony of indie directors topping Hollywood, provoking such an impact that he has already committed to a new Thor adventure- the only character with four Marvel solo movies to date -and a highly anticipated untitled Star Wars film. This was the long way the director went through to release his 7-year-in-the-making WW II dramedy in theaters.You cannot pronounce Adolf Hitler and film together and if you do so, it would unmistakably be a flying red flag. Months prior to its world premiere at TIFF, ""Jojo Rabbit"" was the very definition of controversy among studio executives. Everyone in Hollywood thought, keeping in mind the ingredients, that the movie would be censored or even banned in some territories at any point in time, just like did Armando Iannucci with his highly controversial political satire. Shockingly surprising, all the concern was in vain.""Jojo Rabbit's"" promotional material was not ""Passengers""-level misleading but it did show the palpable preoccupation from Disney about a movie that was not what it seemed. Failing at satire, the Waititi movie turned out to be a sugary fable about the beauty of love in the reign of terror, a heartfelt drama disguised as a fearless Nazi satire. Looking at the bigger picture, it's a missed opportunity for a filmmaker who could have easily delivered his most intimate and disruptive movie yet.How the film depicts the horrors inside the crumbling Third Reich and makes light of the delicate situation behind Jojo's own bubble is an utter letdown. Unlike last year global sensation ""Joker,"" which allegedly endorsed and even promoted real-life violence due to its sympathetic depiction of a sociopath, Waititi's script approaches fanaticism, hate, oppression, xenophobia, and even sexuality in an unstable, too friendly way, often running away from its responsibility to take a stand and speak out loud for itself; by setting the story in the last stages of World War II, it is too afraid to make a true statement about the dangerous ideologies and philosophies it deals with.Fortunately, the film does come off with a victory as a mother-son drama. Sidelined as supporting context, it is far from the core matter and yet it is the scenario the movie really pulls off. Scarlett Johansson's interventions as Rosie Betzler are sparse, but the charm and tangible chemistry between her and Roman Griffin Davis make each of them even more meaningful. Despite being unsurprisingly represented as a secret resister, Johansson holds up the more dramatic arc in the movie. Her moving performance, highlighted by a plainly Oscar-key dinner sequence, is certainly not the one that helped her to land an Oscar nod this year, but it still sets the bar high enough for one of the few actresses who might eventually alternate movie star fanfare and fest indie material.Roman Griffin Davis' performance must be remembered as one of the best child performances of the decade, alongside ""Room's"" Jacob Tremblay, ""Moonlight's"" Alex Hibbert and ""The Florida Project's"" Brooklynn Prince. Jojo is winningly portrayed by Davis' cute and poignant work, his screen appeal is magnetic and the acting range put into his scenes is both raw and tender. By being the youngest actor ever to be put forth by the HFPA, Davis' early professional career looks like one of the brightest of his generation; there's Timothée Chalamet potential in his eyes.""Leave No Trace"" Thomasin McKenzie is a diamond of an actress. McKenzie's Elsa is the focal point of two-thirds of the movie and many special sequences throughout like her introduction à la ""The Grudge"" or the where-are-you-hidden-the-Jew respective one. McKenzie has always chosen character of unusual intensity and here she delivers, once again, grounded work, far from the sweetness flying around from, for instance, an extra-adorable Archie Yates.Comedy-wise, the movie is not off-kilter and daring either. Loosely adapted from Christine Leunens' novel ""Caging Skies"", the script is side-splitting when it really commits to it - the Heil Hitler scene is one for the ages, -especially in the marvelous first act. The comic relief comes in the form of a cartoonish Adolf Hitler and closeted Captain Klenzendorf. Waititi and Rockwell are strangely charming and darkly humorous geniuses. They both are tailor-made for the roles and they prove it by embracing their parts and becoming the beating heart of the movie. Rebel Wilson's slapstick humor plays out flat and unfunny altogether and, keeping in mind her vicious comic timing from the ""Pitch Perfect"" movies or her stunning speeches at the BAFTAs, her involvement as the only female comedic voice is just plainly disappointing.From blocking to the extreme symmetry of the pictures, Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s Wes Anderson-esque cinematography and Michael Giacchino's subtle yet disarming score underlines the child's perspective of a world on fire, both physically and metaphorically, while also crafting an on-point visual representation of the values the story weaves throughout. Beautifully rendered and unpretentiously shot, ""Jojo Rabbit"" sinks its teeth into the silver linings of the time, conveying that sense of forgiveness, freedom, and mutual support the final scene struggles to convey.With Disney acquiring 20th Century Fox, movies like ""Ford v. Ferrari"" and ""Jojo Rabbit"" were either PG-13 box office juggernauts or award-contenders; as things turned out, they were both at once. Fox Searchlight Pictures mid-budgeted original gems have been leading the way for years in theaters, film festivals, and awards ceremonies with mostly original pieces of cinema. The Waititi comedy feels just like the ending point of one of the few studios that infused new life into Hollywood with indie and foreign film-making. Even though Disney keeps claiming that they are going to continue producing and distributing movies under the name of the 25-year-old studio, we all know the amount of creative freedom and defying power would never be the same.""Jojo Rabbit"" by Taika Waititi looked like the sort of movie with the potential to provoke either riots or rallying cries; unfortunately, what is beneath is nowhere near as incendiary or provocative as everybody dreamed of. Close to mocking than satirizing, the Waititi dream movie feels somewhat like less than the sum of its parts, landing up in good-hearted preachy territory, but suffering from some serious tonal shifts halfway through and an utterly disappointing storytelling direction. All things considered, ""Jojo Rabbit's"" top-notch performances, uninvited sweetness, delightful yet countable comedy hints, and affecting mother-son drama saves the movie from being a train wreck, but it still leaves a sour aftertaste for non-mainstream audiences who came to witness Waititi's strengths evolve into something truly powerful."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,7/10,"I had a really bad experience watching this movie in the theater, not related to the movie itself, just that the power went off three times in the screening room, and it delayed the whole thing almost 40 minutes. Still, I'm trying by best to not consider that on my thoughts about the movie, I'm truly trying to be impartial, but I get that maybe my overall feel of the movie might have been influenced by the experience I had watching it. So, just wanna to put that disclaimer out there.Starting with the good stuff, the acting in the movie is great, Roman Griffin Davis is really really good in the movie, as is his friend in the movie Archie Yates, this movie is for both young actors their first credit hole in anything according to IMDb, so, this is a hell of a start for both of them. Taika is also fantastic in it, even though he doesn't have as many scenes I thought he had in the movie. Scarlett Johansson is also good here, even though I don't quite get the Oscar nomination.I love the cinematography, is a beautifully shot film, and it kind of has an ""Wes Andersonish"" style to it.Besides those aspects tho, the best aspect of the movie is the comedy, the movie is so much funny in multiple times. Even though most of the time, the movie is dealing with some truly f-up stuff it gets away with a bunch of stuff by passing by it with a joke and getting a life out of you, even though you shouldn't laugh at it.This satire aspect of it all is especially funny at first, but it short of loses it a bit when the movie goes on. I felt like it got coming back to most of the ""themes"" to joke about that it had already joked about.And at the end, I felt like it didn't balance the comedy/satire aspect with the dramatic part of it. Things happen, like Jojo's mother death, that could potentially be a huge turning point, and focal point going towards the end, but it doesn't really impact his life that much. Even though the scene where he discovers her death is gorgeously executed, without even showing her face, the death itself doesn't impact as much as it should in Jojo's overall story.And I know that most of it is supposed to be an over the top satire, that shows how bad Nazism was, and how screwed people were at the end of it all because of it. And that's fine, however, the movie isn't all an over the top satire, it has its ""down to earth"" moments, and because of those moments, when something that would truly impact the life of our 10 years old protagonist happens (namely his mother passing away), you kind expects that it will be approached in a certain way, and it isn't.So the ending itself, even though it's beautiful with the ""dance"" callback, feels like of empty, like if they could have done more, and evolve Jojo's character a bit more. Again, I love the satire part of it, and how it does a critic of something as bad as Nazism, by making you laugh at it, but I felt like something was missing at the end, and they could have gone further with the story.To sum up, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie, that deals with a really serious subject with a light and funny approach, it's clearly meant to be an over the top satire, but at the end, I felt like it could have gone further in exploring something that were settled up before, and developing its protagonist even more."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,7/10,"I imagine Taika Waititi's pitch to whichever film board gave him funding was an unusual one: a Jewish director wanting to make a Nazi-based comedy, where he would also play an imaginary Hitler. He was probably met with some raised eyebrows, some looks of disbelief, and maybe even a few laughs of incredulity. Regardless, this script and plot is airtight, portraying a child's formative years as a fanatic (albeit useless) member of the Hitler Youth, whilst also harbouring a Jewish refugee. The comedy is inoffensive and caters for all ages, with strong performances from some of Hollywood's most eminent figures. The seriousness of the issue, however, is never completely avoided, and Jojo Rabbit does a good job of still getting the point across about indoctrination and the severity of war.Jojo (played by Roman David Griffiths) is firm advocate for the Nazis (even after an incident at a training day involving a grenade), who finds himself conflicted when it's revealed his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl. This creates the divide of the film: during the day he does the menial work the party cannot be bothered to do themselves, and in the evenings he tries to dissect the mindset of the ""evil"" Jewish race by interrogating his houseguest. Amongst all of this, Waititi's Hitler provides the most comic relief: being imaginary, he does everything from psyching Jojo up, to eating roast unicorn.Hitler is arguably the best device of the film - by being so friendly and funny, he lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, which by the end makes the audience question why they trusted this person to begin with. This gives some insight into how someone in Jojo's position could also buy into the idea of a perfect world under the Nazi party. Other notable performances come from the ever-brilliant Sam Rockwell as Captain Klezendorf, a former military man consigned to looking after children having lost an eye in the war, and Rebel Wilson as his associate Fraulein Rahm, a devout patriot who believes every rumour about the Jews is true. Jojo's best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) is harmless, but the dialogue between him and Jojo is fairly stale at times.Whilst the comedy dominates the movie on the whole, serious scenes are frequent. The darkness of the Nazi party's ideology is constantly reinforced - watching Jojo speak so hatefully about another race can be tricky to watch. You also get a strong sense of the disagreement between Jojo and his mother on the benefits of the war, and how the conflict may have looked from both sides. There are some clunky elements to the storyline: Jojo's father and sister are both eluded to constantly, but neither really have any influence on the plot. It may be heavy-handed to crowbar them into the story at the end, but a lack of representation made their inclusion confusing.Visually, the film is bright, using quirky costume designs and decor to make the era feel lively. Alongside this is the brilliant soundtrack: several iconic British anthems, re-recorded in German to add to the authenticity of the film. As the storyline progresses and the war draws to a close, the town itself begins to lose colour and light, using weather to foreshadow the fate of the Nazis. Whilst Jojo Rabbit doesn't really push any storytelling boundaries (as you might expect of a film with this subject matter), it does a good job of being fun and accessible. Waititi has a habit of making films appealing in this way, and I would consider this another job well done."
JOJO RABBIT,8 August 2020,8/10,"Through the eyes of a child we are transported into 1944-45 Germany-with a more updated, fashionable and somewhat comical viewpoint.Sam Rockwell never fails to take a character and make it his own, and watching Scarlett Johansson made me wish for her as my own mother, but the real star here is young Roman.This bright and shining star understands nuance, sarcasm, and inflection (or at least seems to). As a child with the quickest tongue in civilization and an uncanny knack to convey sarcasm and heartfelt tenderness, it is nothing short of brilliance to be moved so effortlessly by this amazing young man.My only issue with this is the sentiment behind the flick-Taika seems intent on slanting a political view into this otherwise beautiful film, and is only furthering the divide between the people who pay good money to support your whims and those in ivory towers who see fit to preach down to us lowly peasants.So to you, Mr. Waititi, I say, please rethink your ideology. Not every conservative is an enemy, and the 'book burners' and fascists you seem to think need to see this are not who you think they are. Simply take a look around at who is burning the books, assaulting the elderly, throwing tantrums to get what they want; they look a lot like the people you see as the good guys.I can assure you that the majority of us who are center or right of center are incredibly familiar with the history of the Holocaust and don't need a lesson in the facts."
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"We live in dangerous times. In this era of political regression, racists, xenophobes, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white separatists, and fascists, once confined to the periphery of civilised society, have wormed their way back into the cultural mainstream, preaching hate and intolerance under the guise of terms such as ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"". Meanwhile, politicians validate such groups by doing precisely nothing to curtail them and refusing to condemn them (""very fine people on both sides"" and so forth). Scholars and sociocultural anthropologists have posited that hateful right-wing ideologies are more validated now than at any time since the rise of fascism, the best known example of which is, of course, the Third Reich.And so, it's entirely fitting that a film set in this very milieu, which argues that love, tolerance, and kindness can defeat hateful indoctrination, has come along at this precise moment. Based loosely on the 2004 novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, Jojo Rabbit is a political satire written and directed by Taika Waititi. Positing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, Waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as Charles Chaplin (The Great Dictator (1940)), Mel Brooks (The Producers (1967)), Roberto Benigni (La vita è bella (1997)), and even Quentin Tarantino (Inglourious Basterds (2009)) in attempting to defang Nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd. Marketed as an ""anti-hate satire"", the film has no easy task - to use Nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially a bildungsroman, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive. And Waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. The satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film's more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch. Jojo Rabbit is, in fact, that rarest of films - a comedy where the serious moments feel completely earned and a drama where the comedy enhances the seriousness.Großdeutsches Reich, 1945. In the fictional town of Falkenhem, ten-year-old Jojo Betzler (an astonishing debut by Roman Griffin Davis) lives with his whimsical mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson doing probably the best work of her career) and his imaginary best friend - none other than Hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top Waititi). Believing absolutely in his duty to the state, Jojo and his actual flesh-and-blood friend Yorki (a hilarious Archie Yates) attend a Hitlerjugend camp run by the cynical Cpt. Klenzendorf (a powerful performance by Sam Rockwell that was outrageously ignored by the Academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. However, after an accident with a grenade, Joho is sent home. As he recovers, Rosie persuades Klenzendorf, who was demoted after the incident, to give him some work, and so he's employed to distribute propaganda around town. Life is dull but straightforward. That is until he learns his mother has been hiding a young Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (a nuanced performance from Thomasin McKenzie), in a crawlspace in their house.Perhaps Jojo Rabbit's most laudable component is how well Waititi balances the disparate tones, which is a hell of a lot better than Benigni did. The film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering. When the comedy is dropped and Waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch, and it's because they're so well integrated into the overarching comic structure - if you take away the humour and the satirical edge, the film's darker elements simply don't work as well - it's the contrast that makes each element all the more powerful. Waititi's tonal intentions are indicated right from the beginning, as stock footage of German children performing 'Heil Hitlers' is scored (unashamedly anachronistically) by the German version of The Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (1963). Also crucially important to the film's tonal qualities are the bright, colourful palette employed by director of photography Mihai Malaimare Jr. and the whimsical Oscar-nominated production design by Waititi's regular designer, Ra Vincent. Together, they speak to the fact that this is Jojo's worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). It sure doesn't look like any World War II movie you're ever likely to have seen.Thematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between an unchallenged ideology and a complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the Other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do, the fact that good people can be found even in the worst of circumstances. Klenzendorf's arc is especially telling in this respect. Introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film's biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there's considerably more to his character than initially thought, and he commands what's easily the most moving scene in the whole film. This is Jojo's story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he's been taught and what he can see with his own eyes.Of course, although set in 1945, Jojo Rabbit is really about the here and now. Essentially, it mocks extremism, people who hate based on ethnicity or religion, with Jojo's belief that Jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic standing in for people who believe all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans are rapists. In this sense, the film isn't about Nazis at all; their role is allegorical. Rather it's partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. But so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be, finding the individualistic humanity in the Other, behind the political cliché. And although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy - Waititi balances his tones too well.If I were to criticise any element of the film, it would be that Waititi undeniably glosses over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the War. The Nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, which s done so as to render them as easily dismissed figures to be scorned. The reality, of course, was far darker, and it certainly wouldn't have hurt to have at least one Nazi who isn't a figure of fun. In this sense, the film doesn't represent the awful truth, but it never claims to; this isn't a reality-based examination of Nazism, nor does it try to be.Jojo Rabbit is beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. It's an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as Waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a very funny World War II film which imparts a vital message for our confused and divided world of today - if we let them, love will always trump hate, hope will always light a way through the darkness. But only if we let them."
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2019,9/10,"Wow just wow this film is absolutely fantastic from start to finish............I am astounded after seeing it, this film definitely stays around with you. I am pleasantly shocked at how good this film is because in all honesty the trailers got me slightly worried, for some bizarre reason.Taika Waititi is an absolute genius !! There is no other word I can describe him because this film has been made so brilliantly. The stakes are so high for this film to fail miserably, and maybe become almost offensively bad. Before seeing the final product the idea of a Nazi comedy doesn't feel you with confidence because if its not handled properly it end up almost making light of what happened in the war and of the Nazi's themselves. However this film and Waititi in particular have managed to perfectly balance comedy with drama. There are some hilarious laugh out loud moments in this film, mainly due to making fun out of the Nazi's and there ridiculous conspiracy theories. Its using all the hate and turning in into comedy.......such a genius move and it works amazingly well. All this surprising comedy is balanced with some great stomach punching drama, that will leave you breathless. Some fantastic twists.The ensemble cast that this film has is also incredible, everyone is great in the film. Roman Griffin Davis is going to have a career ahead of him........carries the film so well, truly impressive. Scarlett Johansson is a proven great already, but she once again is amazing.....involved in some funny scenes. Sam Rockwell, can the man do any wrong....not in my opinion. Shoutouts to Thomasin McKenzie and Stephen Merchant both them great as well. Maybe some Oscar nods within this cast??????Overall the film is a surprising joy to watch considering the subject matter, who knew it could create such great comedy. 90% out of 100 or 9 out of 10, its almost perfect there is a part in the middle of the film the just wanders around a bit. Apart from that it was amazing, highly recommend it, cant wait to see it again!!"
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,8/10,"You have to hand it to Taika Waititi. It is a brave director who uses Adolf Hitler (albeit an imaginary one) and his Nazi sympathizers in a satire condemning war. There is so much potential for things to go wrong.I had seen a review of this movie on TV and was under the impression that this was a laugh-a-minute comedy that would have me chuckling non-stop, in the vein of Waititi's earlier movie Hunt for the Wilder People. So, I was disappointed to realise early on that this was not nearly as humorous as I anticipated. It was certainly quirky and did make me smile, but there was not the broad vein of comedy that I expected. But then, completely unexpectedly and without me realizing it, this movie opened out and blossomed into a truly lovely story of a young boy confronting the prejudices that society had taught him, seeing them for the falsehoods they are and learning acceptance and love. It is poignant, it is clever, gently funny and it is effective. It isn't a movie about the folly of war after all, but about the folly of ignorance, discrimination, racism and prejudice.The movie boasts a fine cast. Scarlett Johansson is a revelation as the title character's mother. Sam Rockwell is always good and he is good here. I didn't recognise Alfie Allen in his roll as Finkel but he is good too. Archie Yates is funny as JoJo's mate Yorki, Stephen Merchant is great in a brief role as the slimy and scary Gestapo officer. Rebel Wilson shows, as she has in many of her movies, that she can't act and isn't really very funny either. Taika Waititi himself takes on the role of the imaginary Adolf Hitler. I'm not sure if that was a good decision, but I can live with it. Thomasin McKenzie is lovely, fragile and powerful as Elsa. The highest praise though must go to Roman Griffin Davis in what I believe is his first movie. Where did they find him? He is absolutely brilliant in the title role of JoJo. He carries the movie and shines brightly even among the other luminaries in the cast. This kid can act. He is a natural comedian and gets the broad strokes and subtle nuances just right to make us believe and fall in love with little JoJo. I see a big future in store for this kid if he chooses to stay in the movie industry.The reviewer I saw on TV labelled JoJo Rabbit one of the best movies of the year (2019). I think he was correct."
JOJO RABBIT,12 October 2020,3/10,"There were very few parts that I found funny. I appreciated the interesting cinematography and unique concept, but I found it quite unsettling as the perspective seems to cause confusion about whom to root for, especially because the audience already knows the historical outcome. Also, some of their accents were difficult to understand."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,6/10,"I really wanted to like it because it started out very funny and clever with this boy who is in this training camp for kids who learn how to be Nazis and he's wimpier than the other kids. The boy's closest friend is an imaginary Adolf Hitler who offers some very funny sight gags, but that was the first act and there isn't very much different or fun in the other two acts. It does deal with the boy having humanity and realizing that Jews aren't bad, but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be."
JOJO RABBIT,9 September 2019,7/10,Good comedy very well written screenplay but does slow down I bit
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is the funniest film the year. Bear with me, it's about a Hitler youth befriending a Jewish girl who is hiding in his house. Sounds potentially offensive given the time period and that the protagonist is a self-proclaimed Nazi but the offbeat sweetness and humor really shines through. It portrays Nazis as total buffoons throughout and it's a riot, though it also doesn't ignore the harsh realities of the innocent, naive youth during wartime, which is important but makes the film kind of a tonal jumble at points. It's an anti-hate satire that's both a straight middle finger to racism but cements allegorically that it's not going away and the best we can do is move forward dauntlessly. Taika Waititi is a comedic and symbolic wizard. Again, the offbeat nature of the film may not resonate with most, but I found a lot of amusement, emotion and food for thought out of it. It's a black comedy. It explores dark subject matter in a quirky fashion."
JOJO RABBIT,9 May 2021,8/10,"It's often clever with movies to mask what they're really about. Or to use comedy or absurdity to make extremely disturbing events and periods more palatable. Even Schindler's List does this with many parts of it almost like a dark comedy of errors for Jews who can't seem to catch a break. But Jojo Rabbit is more of a pure comedy although it also has some serious moments and mature insights.Hitler has been depicted and mocked countless times. But here, we get a fresh take. This isn't technically Hitler himself, but a projection of him via the mind of a keen Nazi 10-year-old. He worships Hitler, played by Waititi. This projection is naturally a mix of the real Hitler, and his posturing and beliefs, with the kinds of things a 10-year-old thinks about, like childish fears, whims and solutions to problems.There's an important theme here: the indoctrination of children. Sure, the Nazis were bad. But you can't say that a 10-year-old is evil. He's been taught that Jews are hideous, pathetic, evil monsters. And since he hasn't met one, he believes what he's been told. If we can convince kids that Santa exists then it's not surprising that children can be brainwashed to hate a racial/religious group they don't know.There are some laugh-out-loud moments here and there often with a juxtaposition of violence, casual attitudes and historical truths. Like showing kids how to use weapons and sending them off to kill and be killed. In this movie, it's hilarious, but it's also sad and disturbing because it's basically true, at least to some degree especially near the end of WWII when Hitler was becoming desperate.Of course it makes sense for Jojo to meet an actual Jew and have his beliefs challenged. This part of the story isn't that exciting or entertaining and is quite predictable. Still, it's one of the key points of the movie and is generally heartwarming, with many funny moments. Jojo is a good person and once he sees evidence to the contrary, he no longer believes all the propaganda he's been fed about Jews, although it takes a while. If only more adults could do the same - change their mind when confronted with direct counter-evidence to their beliefs.This revelation also weakens his faith in the Nazi cause and admiration of Hitler specifically. I'm left wondering how many adults may have been in a similar situation, buying into the idea that Jews were damaging the economy and caused Germany to lose WWI, not knowing how far the Nazis would go, thinking Hitler was a wise and caring leader who just wanted the country to be stronger, etc., and then realising too late the complete disaster and large scale evil of the Nazis.Perhaps more people should be forced to meet someone from the group they're meant to hate and get to know them before supporting discriminatory laws - their family, their hobbies, taste in music, personality, etc.There are some good supporting performances - Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson come to mind. The boy playing Jojo was very good. Some of the subplots are okay but it feels like they could have been fleshed out more or led somewhere. There is a theme that Jojo needed a father figure which may be why he idolised Hitler so much. A bit like how Shredder uses wayward teens in his foot clan, maybe the Nazis took advantage of boys without fathers at home?I'm interested to see what Taika Waititi does in future. What We Do in the Shadows, Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit show that he has a talent for comedy but also for exploring more mature themes. 8 Heil Hitlers out of 10 for me."
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,5/10,"I have been a fan of Waititi's films since watching Boy several years ago. His follow-up films have been great! But this one seems to have fallen short for me.
I thought visually, the film looks great. I thought he did a great job of capturing the look of the time.
But the characters, which have been his strongest point in past films, are very flat in this one. I never got the sense I knew any of them. Even the Hitler character, I understand he is the boy's conscience, but it just never really resonated with me. Why does Hitler appear when he does, why was he gone for so long?
There were also problems with Jojo's mother played by Scarlett Johansson, and Sam Rockwell's character. Why did the act the way they did, and what made them be against the regime? This inability to get in touch with the two characters made their death moments feel out of place, and disconnected.
And lastly, the biggest problem: Jojo. Why was he such a hard core, pro-Hitler, pro-Nazi person, but his family seemed to be more moderate Germans. Was it because he didn't have too many friends? Why did he not get along with other kids?
So many questions just came up, but it felt like the viewer was just supposed to take everything at face value, so any turns in character just felt contrived and hollow.
And for a coming of age film, I didn't really get that sense with Jojo. I mean, he does appear to change his views, but it doesn't feel like a natural progression, and that goes back to him just not being a well-developed character.
I'm hoping on repeat viewing I might enjoy this film a bit more, but overall, I think Taika Waititi's best work up to this point is behind him. I sure hope his next movie is more enjoyable!"
JOJO RABBIT,25 November 2019,7/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a light-hearted comedy exploring dark elements. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Germany near the end of World War II. He's a lot like other boys his age, struggling to fit in and find his way, searching for group and sense of belonging. Unlike a lot of boys his age, he is a passionate Nazi who gleefully exclaims, ""Heil Hitler!"" as he skips down the street to a camp for young Nazis-in-training. Accompanying him as he skips, cheering him on, is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, himself.Hitler, played with uproarious levels of buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi, provides many of the film's early laughs. Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its early promise. It doesn't crash burn - the end product is still respectable - but all the parts never totally come together in a completely satisfying way. We hope for more from a proven entity like Waititi.The title ""Jojo Rabbit,"" as it turns out, is half the name of the 10-year-old boy and half the name of a cute, fluffy animal. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) becomes the begrudging recipient of the nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" for his choice to not coldly murder an innocent rabbit while at Nazi camp. An older boy makes a different choice regarding the rabbit, then callously chucks the body across the woods.Jojo doesn't fit in here. He doesn't want to be a Nazi. He just doesn't know it yet.Jojo lives with his loving, playful mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who secretly works for the resistance. However, she allows Jojo to follow his misguided Nazi ways, knowing this will keep him safe from party members who search the town for dissenters. Johansson plays the part with impressive layers of complexity. While appalled by her son's Nazi passion, she understands that now is not the time to reprimand him. She quietly does her work and continues to love her son dearly, which is precisely why she opts not to tell Jojo about the young Jewish girl she is hiding in her wall.When Jojo finds the girl (Thomasin McKenzie), he is shocked and horrified. But he quickly discovers that she isn't at all the way Jews have been described to him. ""Where are your horns?"" He asks her sincerely.It's not long before Jojo begins to realize the girl he has been told is a monster is actually a friend, while his imaginary friend is the real monster. If you've seen any movies before, you know this is coming. Nevertheless, a few moments successfully tug at the heart strings. Another moment doesn't work quite as well and ends up feeling forced, even manipulative.The movie's execution winds up being a bit disappointing because of how much potential seemed possible in the opening act. The best moments are the funniest ones, usually featuring Hitler and Jojo, along with a few others that include the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who plays Jojo's friend.Despite the movie's success in comedic execution, the heavier material waivers, leaving the vision of the story a bit foggy. What could have been a best-of-the-year contender, winds up being merely an above average comedy."
JOJO RABBIT,24 April 2020,7/10,"Jojo was really really original a war period and tried to deliver some comedy with some drama at the same time. We can characterize this movie as serious or funny , but I believe its a little bit of both. We should laugh when we see it and think when its over. Casting was good and the script adequate enough!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,9/10,"Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors for a number of reasons. He is the master in taking tragedy and terrible events and turning them into comedy so brilliantly and so well. Hunt for the Wilderpeople was previously my favourite movie from him, as he takes tragedy from his characters and just pisses all over them with such style and grace that their mysterious pasts don't even matter anymore and creates some of the most refreshing and original comedy ever seen in movie history.With Jojo Rabbit, Waititi has finally mastered his craft in taking the tragic tale of WW2 and Hitler and turning it into some of the best pisstake comedy I have seen in years. Waititi does an outstanding job at portraying the funny side of Hitler aswell as directing a movie so crisp and detailed with such likeable and sharply written characters that are memorable as well as relateableThe whole message of the movie in my opinion is just the sheer pointless nature of war and the absurdity of conflicting views based on difference of nationalism and religious beliefs. The character of Jojo was perfectly casted in my opinion aswell as the rest of the cast. Scarlett Johansen plays an incredible role as Jojo's Mom who has a lot to say of what it was like to be a woman in those times. The movie is a prime example of how evil spreads from mind to mind through spreading fear over people of difference of nationality and religion once again revealing the absurdity of it all and creating some of the most unique humor in such a long timeOnce again huge kudos to the production design and direction of the movie which captures the time period aswell as the atmosphere as as the people of WW2 Germany perfectly. I'm going to spoil a scene in this movie but there is a very emotional moment in it where the movie is shot in a way where it looks like the surrounding houses are looking down on Jojo and judging him. I thought that scene was brilliantly done. Waititi has become a master at portraying the inner emotions of each main character and how they see and react to the world around them, finally taking away the mystery of each character and providing a crystal clear lens into the nature of each character. The supporting cast is great too with a very funny supporting performance from Stephen Merchant as one of the Nazi supporters.Overall I had a great time with Jojo Rabbit and has my vote and support for winning Oscar for best casting, direction and screenplay. I will complain of this masterpiece doesn't win a single Oscar because it deserves it."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,Once again this man turns darkness into light and trauma becomes comedy. Hall of fame story teller.Great acting too.
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,8/10,"Well deserved 'Best adapted screenplay' Oscar. Originally intended to be a drama, the adaptation into a comedy certainly makes light of the controversial subject matter. Fox Searchlight's insistence that Taika himself play the imaginary friend as Hitler also offsets this.Taika Waititi makes films that are uniquely his with his own brand of humour. Some people may not identify with (NZ) dry sense of humour though. It is certainly well deserved after writing this back in 2012. Credit to all actors in this film also, especially the children actors."
JOJO RABBIT,21 July 2020,9/10,"This was quite a risky movie and could have gone extremely wrong but it turn out to be very funny, powerful and brilliant."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2021,6/10,Witty with strong character moments here and there but there's too much pandering and repetitiveness. Good screenplay. Emotional payoff doesn't land.
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,4/10,"Review:
'Jojo Rabbit' is a comedy-drama film directed by Taika Waititi, It is based on Christine Leunens's book 'Caging Skies'.
I was excited to watch this movie once I heard it was a comedy that was nominated for Best Picture and written and directed by Taika Waititi. I was very disappointed as I was watching it and by the time it was over, I was actually upset about what I seen.
Roman Griffin Davis portrays the title character, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler, a Hitler Youth member who finds out his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. He must then question his beliefs, while dealing with the intervention of his imaginary friend, a fanciful version of Adolf Hitler (Waititi).
Starting off with the acting, it was pretty good. I'm glad Scarlett Johansson got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; she was really good in the film. There is a lot of talk about how good Roman Griffin Davis was in film, but I didn't really find he was that great. Sure, he did a good job keeping up with the adult actors, but it wasn't anything special. I especially liked Sam Rockwell as the general who was training the kids to be Nozi soldiers.
It may just be the fact that this movie just wasn't for me, and that may well be the case given the great reviews it was been getting. I didn't laugh during the film and I found the overall story to be a little confusing. I know Taika Waititi is a director who like to do things out of the ordinary and I respect that type of film making a lot. This one just didn't hit me the way I was expecting.
Overall, it may just be the fact that I personally didn't like the film. If you like movies that take a heart-breaking situation and puts an outrageous spin on it, check this one out for sure. I can't see myself revisiting it, so I can't personally recommend it.
2/5"
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,9/10,"Oh that Hitler!Quiet an amazing feat, to create a context in which the most reviled character in history elicits smirks, guffaws, and out and out belly laughs. New Zealand film director wonder Taika Waititi not only tiptoes a dangerous minefield of comedy tragedy, but also inhabits a Stoogey Fuhrer in one of the most outrageous acting stabs in recent memory.Everything revolves around giddy Hitler Youth Jojo (fabulously sincere and boyishly feverish Roman Griffin Davis), as he grows into his new double digit age, lapping up the local propaganda, eagerly striving to belong, and chumming about with his invisible chancellor pal. A sweet buddy-buddy picture? A vibrant coming of age story? A stunning moral tale? A slapstick comedy? A bloody war drama? It's all here. Plus Sam Rockwell!Poking fun at historic tragedy with a short stick is dicey business, and though plenty of serious subplots run throughout, ""Jojo Rabbit"" works because the characters, from major to minor, are brilliantly developed, and impeccably acted. This is one crazy warm war film.Much like Wes Anderson's best works, which this film sniffs of, ""JoJo Rabbit"" cleverly punctuates poignant moments with brilliant British invasion pop songs - using the German versions to great effect.Go JoJo go!hipCRANK"
JOJO RABBIT,28 October 2019,9/10,"This is a great satire about a young boy who sees his imaginary friend as Adolf Hitler. One day he finds a young girl who is a jew hiding in his house. His mother played by Scarlett Johansson has helped hide her. There is some funny moments in this film, there are also heartfelt moments too. Particularly between mother and son, Scarlett is fantastic as Jojo's mother. Taika is great as Hitler, there are some really funny lines in this film and great satire. It is very enjoyable film that I enjoyed with a decent crowd. It is also has great music"
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,7/10,"If you're going to make a movie about the Nazis, you better make sure it's going to be good. Multiply that rule by infinity if you're going to make it a comedy.Because of this strict rule, only a select few have been able to take the greatest human atrocity of the modern era and turn it into a joke. Charlie Chaplin did it in 1940 with ""The Great Dictator"" (although he wasn't fully aware of the horrors), followed by Roberto Benigni with ""Life is Beautiful"" in 1998. Now in 2019, Taika Waititi has added his name to that illustrious list with his newest film, ""Jojo Rabbit"".Set in the waning months of World War II, this ""anti-hate satire"" follows the life of Jojo Betzler, a young boy growing up in the Hitler Youth. His patriotism runs so high Adolf Hitler himself acts as his imaginary friend. One day, Jojo discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa in their walls. This bewilders the boy, putting him in a quandary over what to do with his foreign guest. With an enemy in his home, Jojo must confront his nationalistic ideals and learn for himself what truly lies within the people he was born to hate.Apart from a few problems structurally and tonally, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is near faultlessly helmed by New Zealand native and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" director, Taika Waititi.From the often symmetric shot composition to the sumptuous production design, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is the most Wes Anderson-esque film that Wes Anderson didn't direct. It does feel like Waititi is copying a little too hard from time to time, but the distinct whimsical style he employs effortlessly immerses the audience into the satirical world.Aiding this immersion, Waititi does what he knows best and interweaves comedy with drama as he pokes fun at the Nazis while also using them as a smaller target for his much grander message. That message is of peace and love, which can be authentically found within this story, especially in the interactions between Jojo and Elsa.A negative side effect of Waititi's fluent directing is that it makes his middling writing stick it like a sore thumb.His risque plot eventually gets boiled down to a slightly over-simplistic message that isn't able to land its punches as hard as it should. Weirdly, it all feels a little too safe for this kind of setting with these types of characters.The film also starts to lose its way around the middle third as a few of its many ideas and characters get lost in the shuffle. A few reveals are shocking, but only because not enough time was put into them to make us believe they were important enough in the first place.Even with these problems looming throughout the runtime, the script does have its shining individual moments. The slapstick one-liners mostly all land and the heart-tugging dramatic lines do hit close to home.With an assembled all-star cast, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is filled with great performances from A-list stars and fresh discoveries.The biggest hidden treasure that has been unearthed is the talent of Roman Griffin Davis. In his first-ever role, Davis perfectly translates his precocious character from the page to the screen. The future will be deservedly bright for him.Young star Thomasin McKenzie also does excellent work as Elsa. She already made a name for herself with last year's ""Leave No Trace"" and her role here further solidifies her strong track record.Scarlett Johansson plays Rosie, Jojo's sympathetic mother who takes in Elsa for hiding. Away from her usual Marvel role, this may be Johansson's best work in years as she is both hilarious and endearing.In more purely comedic roles, Taikia Waittiti and Sam Rockwell are a blast as Adolf Hitler and Captain Kenzendorf, respectively.Taking the horrors of humanity and turning it into a comedic moral lesson is no small feat, especially when you target the worst of the worst. So even with his struggles here and there, immense credit should go to Waititi as he has crafted one of the better films of the year and made something that will be timeless in its message and morals."
JOJO RABBIT,25 May 2020,3/10,"While a bit funny at times, nothing in this film served a purpose and the strange pacing made for a very distracting watch. The strange mix of characters also do not help. You have clown'esque Gestapo characters, dead serious resistance fighters and imaginary Hitlers. It just does not work.It isn't precicely tone-deaf, but rather a bit confused. This movie does not want to decide what it is.If there was a message in here, it is completely lost due to the insanely detached elements that fly all over the place. There hardly is any real development of either characters nor plot to be seen.Johansen play the character straight and despite obvious faults in her style of upbringing, somehow manages to be somewhat believable. The main protagonist however would, in the real world, be ripe for institutionalisation. Seriously, that kid is a monster!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,9/10,"Taika Waititi's film (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar) is tender and cruel, bold, clever and surreal and keeps its ambitions under control. It is a satire about the Second World War. This is followed by a lonely boy from Germany whose views of the world around him change when he discovers that his mother hides a young girl of Jewish descent in their home. His fantastic friend on this journey of discovery is... Adolf Hitler.""Jojo Rabbit"" ruthlessly and brutally mocks Hitler and the Nazis, but at the same time treats the issue with respect and seriousness while maintaining a difficult balance. It's a gamble as many could go wrong, yet the film is fun, instructive and accessible to the younger and strangely beautiful. A reminder that love can dominate even in the most difficult situations.As I watched it bring to mind Benini's masterpiece, ""La vita e bella"" but it doesn't reach that level. However, Taika Waititi, with a fresh look, delivers a distinctive and well-intentioned film that keeps you alert until ... the next ""Thor"" and basically features Griffin Davis and Tomasin McKenzie, two amazingly expressive young actors and Scarlett Johansson who never disappoints us - her nomination for an Academy Award also proves that. Sam Rokwell and Rebel Wilson give the comic touch to the film.At a time that racism is showing up strongly in many parts of the world, ""Jojo Rabbit"" may be just the movie we need right now. We will laugh, we will be moved, we will not forget the past but we will certainly feel a little better for humanity."
JOJO RABBIT,19 April 2020,8/10,"Here in Russia, it's a common opinion that we have a twisted perception of German language because the first encounter with it usually happens when we watch a war movie, where hearing the German speech usually means that something really bad is about to happen. I'm not sure if I ever had nightmares about running away from ""Ze Germans"", but just the sound of Till Lindemann counting from one to ten does indeed sound like some unholy incantation.My generation is maybe the last one still scarred with this cultural propaganda. There have been so many war films made in the USSR days, and those films still keep on coming. And the absolute most of them feed you two main things: fear and hate. I wish it was otherwise, I really do. But that's how it is, and it's part of the reason I never really liked war movies as a kid.So I can honestly say one thing. Jojo Rabbit is the best war movie that I've never seen in my childhood. But I'm still grateful that it happened now. Despite being such a grotesquely simplified guilty pleasure, it has one thing any other serious films about this topic lack: sanity. That, and humanity. The 10 year old boy with scars on his face and a swastika on his armband somehow managed to keep his soul intact, and that child's purity is what allows you to see the horrors of war but avoid its traumas.It might be Waititi's writing that won this film an Oscar. But the heart of it was carried by Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. Ever since Lost in Translation it was clear that Johansson can act, but for me this film has revealed her ability to steal scenes and carry them single-handedly. That soot mustache speech and a dance that ensued, that's quite mature for someone generally associated with ""sexy"" characters. And Mr Rockwell, oh my, I didn't like him since The Green Mile, respected him since Moon and loved him since Seven Psychopaths, but here he's just a perfect cherry on top. The last battle attire, that smokey-eyed stare, he's a true hero for giving the Nazi image a face nobody has probably dared to put on before, at least not in such a dashing and self-accepting way.The accolades could go on and on. To Waititi's ""your own, personal Adolf"", to Jojo himself, who managed to come from a clumsy kid to a swaggering hustler at the end, to the brave and gentle ghost in the walls. Waititi has a talent for using the little details that look simple but add that very taste that turns cloying into touching and dumb into funny. He's done it before, and he's clearly doing it this time as well.Whatever silly nonsense this film has shown, it is not something to be bothered about I think. If a war movie has to be surrealistic to spread love instead of hate, let it be. There's nothing civil about war anyway, so better a funny Hitler than the real one."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2021,9/10,"Funny, poignant, dramatic and heartbreaking in equal measure. Easily the best movie I've seen in the last 12 months."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,9/10,"This story touches the heart in a clever way. Everybody can feel with the young boy, who understands Hitler as a friend by not better knowing it. It must be irritating for kids to cope with the circumstances around in such a bad dictatorship. I love the movie - it's great! There were some kids in the audience, asking mother, father, grandfather what happend at some point. So it was a schooling lesson for three generations. On the other hand, it was full of funny gags that showed how crappy the Third Reich was in everydays life. No German could have made this movie. It's good that Taika Waititi did. It was fun to watch. Scarlett Johansson got a deserved nomination at the Oscars. She is great in that movie! Big recommendation for freethinker."
JOJO RABBIT,12 April 2020,8/10,Probably one of the best stories ve seen on the screen. Ilt's a nice change to see the point of view of the other side during the war. Great acting too.
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,6/10,"Silly predictable movie. Does not capture imagination. And far from Wes Anderson talent. But I Liked it. whats more interesting is Scarletts career. Have you wondered how far a pretty face can get a girl? Pretty far. Damn Scarlett is a bad actor. you can easily see her looking with her soulless indifferent face at real corpses. If a 10 YO boy is a better actor then you. Oh, boy. You are bad."
JOJO RABBIT,31 March 2020,8/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" was definitely one of the most talked about movies of 2019. It follows a young Hitler Youth member in the last months of World War II. Roman Griffin Davis makes an excellent performance as the film's title character, he does with so much heart and charm that I don't think anyone can't be touched by him. He also portrays little Jojo with conflicted feelings, as he's torn between his mother's (Johansson) efforts to hide a young Jewish girl (McKenzie) and his dreams of fighting for his nation, in a masterful way, many adult actors only could dream of. ""Jojo Rabbit"" has its ups and downs, director Waititi is funny as Jojo's imaginary friend version of the Führer himself, and the interactions between Jojo and Yorki (Yates) are often hilarious. The downs are also a few unfortunately. First of all, quite superficial - but still, the accents are unbearable. I get it, they wanted to be genuine but it fell short. Secondly, my main issue, the emotional impact of the film's events on the characters are not big enough. Halfway in, Jojo's mother is killed, and besides, Elsa doesn't ever know if her family is alive at all. ""Jojo Rabbit"" misses opportunities to hit its audience with an emotional blast, instead settling way to quickly for feel-good moments and quirky jokes. Nonetheless, Waititi's WW2 dramedy is filled with heartwarming moments and a very nice, hopeful ending, although it could have been a bit more attached to the - honestly - traumatic events the unlikely duo had been through."
JOJO RABBIT,9 August 2020,7/10,This movie was just an unexpected surprise. The kids who plays jojo was amazingly perfect. The screenplay was perfect too. A very mature movie though it begins as a comic satire and a dark comedy. Hats off to the creators!
JOJO RABBIT,26 October 2019,9/10,"It's Mel Brooks meets Wes Anderson with dashes of Amelie. Hard to believe I could laugh so much and stifle tears to the point where I think I might start blubbering in a theatre over a movie about Nazis and Hitler. They don't seem to go together. Well, humor and adorableness don't seem to go in the same sentence as Nazis and Hitler. There truly were no flaws in this movie. The directing, acting, writing was seamless. It had depth and was never one-note, and really left you thinking afterwards. I imagine it will be up for numerous Oscars, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't win multiple.The kids who played Jojo and Elsa were a delight. It's hard to believe there's that much talent in kids that age. They could be both humorous and endearing, and had wonderful chemistry with each other. I was surprised at how good Scarlett Johannsen was, as she usually plays the ""hot girl,"" or she's kicking someone in the face. She really gave a wonderful, heartfelt performance, and you really grew to care about her relationship with her son and her role in trying to free Germany from oppression and do her part.The film maintained the perfect balance and never went too far with it's humor, and never spoon-fed the audience with the obvious message of Nazis, propaganda, oppression, and war are bad. There were a few uncomfortable moments with Jojo's trained beliefs, but I felt they were important to break from the humor to the reality that this kid was brainwashed with some really nasty stuff. It sold the evolution of the relationship between Jojo and Elsa so that it wasn't patronizing or predictable.Just a delight, and wonderful film making on the part of Taika Waititi. I could see how some may see the trailer, not see the film, and think the subject matter is being trivialized in some way by some insensitive WASP director. When, in fact, it was the exact opposite, and the director is Jewish. That shouldn't have to be mentioned, but in todays current climate where extremist think there are Nazis under every rock, and who need to project their offense at everything to somehow make someone else's struggle about them, I think it's worth mentioning. And, in all likely, those types would hate this film anyway since their solution to everything is punching someone in the face or screaming someone down, where the message of this film is that change comes from talking, learning, understanding, and growth, that leads to compassion and love."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,9/10,"The movie has a lot of Waititi brilliance, and imaginary Adolf is completely original and inspired. While the book Caging Skies is one htefest of crazed feminist misandry especially in its second half, which Waititi did not even read, he made best out of the source material that did not deserve to be honored by his great talents in fact. Interestingly, the book steals much from the Underground of Kusturica, and other Balkan inspirations are responsible for this little movie gem - from Tito and Me, another take on imaginary dictator friend, to Waititi admitting reading about wars in the Balkans to give the human touch to the story. For atroc ities and other ills, he had a lot of experience with the Brits, and na zi rallies to Beatles music seem like a perfect fit, as does the casting of some pretty ug ly inside and out Brit characters. Some humanity Waititi sees also in Germans, most notably the complex Sam Rockwell character, one of the heroes of the movie. Overall Waititi's faith in humanity shines through and he manages to distance himself from the pretty repugnant source ""book"" luckily the first half of which did offer such opportunity with a lot of input from the Jewish-Maori genius."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,9/10,"I started watching this without any bias at all, ready to give it a rating without holding back. Well this definitely deserves a 9, here's why.Plot:
We mainly follow along the young boy (jojo) and his imaginary ""friend"" Hitler. I absolutely loved the story of this, it's so wholesome and yet very comedic with a really dark comedy like vibe but suitable for the whole family. There are definitely some edgy jokes but the story is done really well where it's funny, respectful, and very endearing.Acting:
The cast is really great, they obviously took their time to choose the right people. Jojo was played by a very talented kid who did a great job as well as the Jewish girl. Taika did a really good job at delivering a funny performance yet very unique performance of hitler.
You really get a sense of feeling towards all the characters and that's done by good writing, characterization and acting.Cinematography:
It's good, they dont rely too much to cgi but theres some cool bits in there. The story doesn't really involve much affects but when they do have them, they're done well. All the shots are great as well.Summary:
A very good movie which I believe you should definitely watch. In fact it was so good I could probably watch it again. And I absolutely hate watching movies more than once."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,8/10,"Taika waititi has done it with full incredible story and amazingly represented it. A serious situation in Germany presented funnily leaving you emotional, awestruck and a strong message. A must watch."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is about a little boy who is trying to be like Hitler and he meets a Jew. He gets really caught up in his feelings and doesn't know what to do when there was a war going.I didn't know what to think of this film when I left the theatre. I knew I liked it, I just couldn't think why I liked. About forty-five minutes after I have ideas on why I liked it and the stuff I didn't find to interesting about it.I thought the acting was a great aspect to the film. Sam Rockwell gave a great performance. There was one scene that he was in that made my eyes get all teary. Scarlett Johansson gave a good performance also. Rebel Wilson's character was sort of funny, but I wasn't too fund of her for a reason at the end of the film. It was a little offensive I thought. If you see the film you will know what I am talking about. Roman-Griffin Davis did an outstanding performance. He was the standout of the movie. He was funny and also really funny. Thomasin McKenzie was another great performance in this picture.The message in this film was a great one. I won't say it because I don't want to spoil it, but you could probably be able to pick it out. I thought it was complex and deep in the story. Once you found it, it really meant something.Overall, Jojo Rabbit was a fantastic film I would defiantly recommend for a laugh and maybe a tear."
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,7/10,"Well like every WW2 movie in germany, hiding a jew in their house. This movie is about last 6 months of the great war. The boy, JoJo, supports Nazi, is seeing idiotic Hitler in his imagination, gets injured and is recuperating from the accident. The way he sees war and how it affects his family and his friend Yorki.
He gets to know the jew hiding in his home, becomes friends with her even though he didnt wanted this to happen at start. Will she be able to survive? and will the little boy get out of this swastic ideology?"
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,2/10,"Only I say about this movie is first of all I feel sleep twice ,not very funny . The best was Sam Rockwell and that's all"
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,1/10,"People are either easily pleased or so starved for originality that they salivate at what is mediocre at best.
Pasty English kids, idiotic attempts at humour and stuff Mel Brooks would've kicked Harvey Korman's or Cloris Leachman's butts for if they'd have put in efforts like the principals in this waste of film did.Waste of time."
JOJO RABBIT,23 October 2019,5/10,"I was hoping that this film could be profound and entertaining since I love satire, and it has a strong cast. Unfortunately, its humor and ambition never reach the potential they could possibly strive to obtain. The film is set during World War II in Nazi Germany, and tells the story of a young Hitler Youth member whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. The boy is blindly following the despicable scourge of Nazism, but is forced to confront his beliefs when he discovers that a Jewish girl is hiding in his home.While the story could have engaged in very clever and acerbic satire showing the true depravity of fascism, the film's attempts to skewer the Nazi ideology never really rises above the pedestrian. The film's jokes are surprisingly often thin and juvenile rather than truly witty and thought-provoking, and they manage to wear thin quickly. Another problem with this film is that its purpose--a supposedly edgy satire against the Nazi regime--is somewhat self-defeating when the film is never quite as edgy or provocative as it could be, opting to often play it safe by simply resorting to baseline and surface-level writing. While the characters are engaging enough, they are never developed enough to truly care about their motivations or what happens to them. The film also contains a bizarre tonal change that is executed very poorly, unlike the brilliant manipulation of tone in something like Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite."" It looks interesting aesthetically, with engaging cinematography and unique production design reminiscent of Wes Anderson, and it has some clever moments in its first act. Unfortunately, though, there isn't a ton else especially memorable on display here. 5/10"
JOJO RABBIT,16 September 2019,8/10,"I was fortunate enough to catch Taika Waititi's latest film at the 2019 TIFF People's Choice Screening and what an absolute treat it was. In this ""anti-hate satire"", we follow the trials and tribulations of a German boy who finds a Jewish girl living in his attic and is confronted with a clash of his conditioned values as a little nazi boy. If you think the synopsis sounds crazy, you have no idea what you're in for...Though seemingly taking inspiration from the works of Wes Anderson and Mel Brooks, ""Jojo"" manages to create something in an entirely new ball park pulling off a spoof that manages to be hilarious while not disrespecting its touchy subject matter, a feat that only the wonderful Taika (who directed, wrote and acted as Imaginary Hitler in) could pull off so well. The film also boasts some killer cinematography as well as a wonderful soundtrack, both of which punctuate some of the films quieter moments to ground us in the era and atmosphere of the film.As mentioned above, Taiki plays the titular boy's imaginary Hitler friend and leaves you weak in the stomach from laughing so much - he's, quite simply, hilarious. And yet, he doesn't manage to overpower the rest of the cast which includes Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Jo and Rebel Wilson all of whom are wonderful. But most notably, it's the child performances that take center stage. The two little leads are incredible, making us laugh at times, shed a tear at others and just feel for the two of them. Their comedic timing, range and overall performances are done to a T - it's because of them the film works as well as it does.In today's day and age, more than ever, people need a reason to just sit back and smile and this makes ""Jojo Rabbit"" a truly timely film. Leave it to Mr. Waititi to take one of the most gruesome periods in human history and, believe it or not, find both a humour and beauty in its telling. It's also entirely original in its execution and is perhaps the perfect example of the kind of film Hollywood could use more of. All that's left to say is thanks for the laughs Taika; and for your brilliantly twisted mind!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,6/10,"Having finally managed to find the time I decided to watch Jojo Rabbit, I had managed to avoid any trailers or spoilers. All I knew is who directed and the rough outline it was about the Nazis, Hitler in particular and was a surreal comedy.
What stood out about this prior to seeing it was a general mood that this was too difficult a movie to describe. However having watched it and in the main enjoyed it, its simply an updated Anne Frank style story with some humour thrown in.
Unfortunately it is not in the same league as Wilderpeople. Its good thats all not great. The humour mostly lands and in the main how you feel about the silly version of Hitler is likely how you will feel about this overall. A glaring mistake for me however was during the movie Hitler used a phrase which made reference to something which was actually contemporary which had a jarring effect as it spoiled the illusion of this being set during the war.
Despite it mainly being a comedy with most of the gags at the expense of the Nazis the final act does turn darker which may explain why so many didnt like this movie.I can understand why as it feels like two separate movies split by the final act.
Worth going to see but its not groundbreaking and the way its being sold to the public doesnt really fit with how it actually is. Its basically a rehash of Anne Frank with a few more gags."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is not only a masterpiece ,it is also very original.
So different from everything I have watched, and I have watched thousands of movies.
Most movies are unoriginal. This is so great.
A war allegory, the enemies in our minds and the thought of being a good patriot not allowing you to see clearly.
I cried a lot in this movie.
I did not expect it to be so captivating.
Scarlett Johansson proves her self to be a great actress, away from those idiotic blockbuster movies.
The little boy's acting performance was intense."
JOJO RABBIT,6 May 2020,10/10,"Too funny to be art.
Much social-commentary for comedy.Lighthearted. Deep. Emotional. Historical. Lovable.And Everything else, except sexy.
Well there's Scarlett Johansson as well."
JOJO RABBIT,16 December 2019,10/10,"A film in which an imaginary Adolf Hitler is played by a Polynesian Jew? Only one person has the balls to pull this off. Taika Waititi's anti-hate satire makes fun of nazi-Germany and its hitlerjugend in his newest film, Jojo Rabbit. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis),a teenage boy who wants to become the best fascist there is and belong to something bigger than life, joins a youth camp that trains young boys and girls to become better Germans. The camp gets run by one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who spends his time sketching fabulous capes and designing new outrageously camp weapons. With him we get his loyal righthand Finkel (Alfie Allen) and his loud lefthand Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson).When Jojo tries to prove himself to the older bullish camp guide counsellors, things don't go exactly as planned and the young boy ends up wounded back home. With his face now looking like a Picasso painting - it's really not that bad - he's afraid to go out into the light of day and would rather spend his days getting pep talks from his good friend Adolf (played by Taika Waititi himself). Bright spirit Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has other plans and pushes her son to take on the dangerous world that waits for him. But when Jojo comes home sooner than expected, he finds something every Nazi fears the most, a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home.The sweet humour seems strange when dealing with a subject matter like this, but fans of Taika's work know he's done weirder things. After critically acclaimed films such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and 'Thor: Ragnarok', the New Zealand director is ready to take on awards season and does so in a very provocative but extremely balanced style. It is a satire and makes fun of bending the truth into a way it becomes enjoyable, yet the film builds up to an emotional third act that feels as bittersweet as it is heartwarming.Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) surprises with a certain flair and joyful theatricality we haven't seen from her in a while. Not since Ghost World in 2001, has she done something this funny and edgy. It's a welcome return to form and hopefully post-'Avengers: Endgame', she keeps on track with these interesting and unique roles. Charming newcomer Roman Griffin Davis knows how to carry the entire film. This is his story, and the way Waititi wrote his character to grow over the course of almost two hours will resonate with audiences who sometimes just don't know better and take the truth for granted. His young and promising co-star Thomasin McKenzie (Leave No Trace), who plays Jewish stowaway Elsa, is perfectly synced with him. Their dialogue and emotional arc grows from Jojo asking if she sleeps upside down like a bat - because that's what Jews do - to fully embracing the fact she's human and fills a void in his family's house, which has been empty for such a long time.Composer Michael Giacchino's score is as brilliant as ever. He proves himself once again to be one of the most diverse and interesting composers in the business, bringing guitars and drums to 'Jojo's March', while a choir is angelically chanting in the background. The visually pleasing production design and use of colour in every scene is almost Wes Anderson-like, but with the heart of Taika Waititi. Jojo Rabbit is just the cheeky little film we didn't know we needed. An unapologetically brave reminder to face your fears and be resolute when speaking up against those who are wrong."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"The film follows the last days of WWII through the naive eyes of a 10 year old boy brought up in the Third Reich. Taika Waititi proves himself once again as a once in a generation comedic genius who is able to portray a story that is hilarious, tragic and heartwarming at the same time while depicting a troupe of wacky characters that don't feel out of place. The cast is phenomenal, starring the young Roman Griffin Davis as the titular character and rounded up by comedic heavy-hitters like Taika Waiti, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant. The visuals are colorful and interesting, while the editing and pacing is flawless. One of the best of 2019 for sure."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,1/10,"This review is based on just over half way through the film, as I walked out before seeing the rest.I am completely baffled how anyone could give this mess anything above 5, let alone 10! I mean a 10 means the film is perfect and has company like The Godfather, The Matrix or Leon? Is this film on a par with those movies? clearly, absolutely not!I assumed the 10/10 reviews were just bot generated and many look like they are, but some seem genuine. By the way IMDB, you really need to do something about this, way too many terrible films get a 10/10, especially modern releases.Right from the off of this crap fest, the childish, camp, stupid attempts at humour fail completely. The film is boring, nothing interesting happens and who cares what a child thinks about Hitler and the war. The acting is awful, the script and story are poor, why would anyone praise this film. It was pretty much universally panned, quite rightly, by the critics. Its not even accidentally funny.Nothing more to add other than this is rubbish."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,4/10,"I am a fan of Taika waititi and see many types of documenatry on WW2. The movie is trying too hard using dark humor to talk about the true eventband cruelty of Nazi.Acting is either overload or sloppy, line is cheesy. Adolf Hilter is already a evil figure in history so I find hard to adapt using cuteness of him to talk about the sensitive evil plan. I like its creative concepts of the movie but find no connection in this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,9/10,"Acting, camera, music, script. Fantastic! This movie is truly amazing and inspiring. No need to say anything more. Did I mention funny? I save ""10"" for movies that was the best in their genre. This flick has no genre and it did not hold me glued to my seat like ""Gladiator"" and me and my girlfriend will not revisit it like we do with ""Love Actually"" once a year. Therefore a measly 9 :)"
JOJO RABBIT,1 April 2020,1/10,"JOJO RABBIT (2019)Ten-year-old Jojo has a silly, satirical Hitler as his imaginary playmate. Fun, right? No. The film seems to be want to show Jojo awaken from indoctrinated hatred in a humorous way.Once again I veer from the crowd.
Once again I veer from the critics.
Once again I was not interested from the trailer.
Once again friends whose taste I often align with loved it.
Once again I watched out of curiosity against my instincts.
Once again I found a film to be a waste of my time.
Once again I found a ""popular"" film to be offensive.
Once again a popular film made me feel sad for humanity.
Once again I am I realize I am not a fan of Scarlett's.
Once again I did enjoy the color scheme in the film.
Once again I should have known better, but was curious how one might possibly make the Nazis humorous.
Once again the violence and hanging in the film was awful and creepy.
Once again a movie with huge ratings made me sick."

I think this is a very clever satire with multiple lol moments. I love Jojo, it's really hard not to like him and seeing his strength throughout the story is so touching. At times it's really heart breaking and questions do rise, but it's a great movie."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,7/10,"The trailer represents the first 10mns of the film. It conceals a HUGE plot point. Well, it's not a bad thing, I'm sick of watching a whole movie through the trailer.It was an overall good movie.Good points:Subtle humorFun satireSome really good characters (Rosie, Captain K)Some scenes have great emotion value, like the Gestapo inspection and the last battleNo manicheismBad points:
The training camp part is way too short!! The movie gives too much time to the story between Jojo and Elsa, which felt redundant to me at many points.Some bad characters (Alfie Allen is useless, Rebel Wilson overacts, as usual)The movie relies too much on music and dancing when it doesn't know what to doIt took me out of the movie when nazis called themselves nazis. It was supposed to be a pejorative nickname"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"It's Taika so let's just get that out of the way, and to the people complaining about the film's subject matter it IS A SATIRE so calm down for a moment. Having said that the film is also much more poignant, powerful, and charming than I expected and most of that is due to Taika's beautiful direction and the performances of Roman Griffin Davis, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson. The films message of anti-hate and wonderfully humorous script also elevate it to a place in which I haven't seen a film go in a long time. I personally love this film and I think everyone needs to watch it as soon as possible!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2021,6/10,"It falls far behind what is promises in the opening scenes. I find myself getting more and more uninterested as it goes along. Jokes are played too safely, especially the Hitler shtick, it's not enough to make it funny and I find it rather annoying. There's not enough interesting conflict to make it a great movie, I was waiting for it to be much more than a silly comedy but it never happened.Acting wise it is well acted for the most part, everyone seems to have done a great job on it. The cinematography makes it look like a Wes Anderson movie at times. And for the soundtrack it was great, there's a lot of energy and it fits well with the tone. All in all it's pretty entertaining if you love dumb silly comedy but I'm afraid it's not much more than that."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2021,8/10,"A young boy who is a fanatical member of the Hitler Youth, finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl...during the final days of WW2.Doesn't sound like the sort of material that would make for an instant comedy classic, but it does just that! It shows some of the ridiculousness that occurred in Nazi Germany, both in terms of preparing the Hitler Youth, but in the views that were held and encouraged about the Jewish population.It does however show that not everyone was a die hard Nazi, and many people wanted the Nazis gone and the war over... Germany is shown as a colourful vibrant country, where the population were not all the enemy, but themselves also the victims of the Third Reich.The balance between humour and poignant sentiment, is balanced fairly well...and whilst a few moments could have packed more of a punch emotionally, the overall result is a very enjoyable film with brilliant performances from a stellar A-List cast. Worth taking the time to see!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 April 2020,8/10,"Waititi perfects the balance between making you laugh one moment and cry the next, or both simultaneously. Understandably, a movie about Nazis and the Holocaust is going to divide critics. However, the director shows the idiocy of the Nazi ideology. It will sit comfortably next to Spike Lee's Blackkklansman, raising questions about identity and acceptance that are deeply relevant today."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,8/10,"That was something unexpected. Waititi is a true and genuine talent of a Tarantino proportions. But where Tarantino mainly stays within his universe and acting, it feels that Waititi is much more diverse, while he can tackle almost any genre. It's not for everyone, yet he manages to make you experience actual deep emotions towards the characters and get the best out of actors. I saw many movies with Scarlet Johanson, but it was the first time ever, that I felt real appreciation towards her as an actress. She got the Oscar nod for the best supporting actress, but after seeing this one, in my opinion, she should have won. Young actors are very young, but they gave an excellent performances. It was a real shock moment once you see some of the sadder parts of the movie. Presentation is everything and this one is a rare movie that makes you sad and happy simultaneously, and that's where Waititi's talent shines. It's not an epic 10/10 blockbuster of an Avengers endgame proportions, but it's unexpected and brilliant. It's rare for me to re-watch those types of movies, yet I would like to return to that same universe and I definitely would like to see the follow up of the story if he ever decides to shoot it."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,6/10,"Jojo Rabbit is summed nicely in a single word, which is ""divisive."" The first hour is an uncomfortable cringe-fest, asking the audience to self-assess the reasons why cinema even exists as an art form. Some natural questions arise, such as whether Jojo Rabbit really was based on a book (it was), whether it is appropriate to portray Adolf Hitler as a bumbling stooge with separation issues (not sure, but the first hour had me leaning toward a ""hell, no""), and whether we'll be able to see Alfie Allen in anything after Game of Thrones and not think of sausages (probably not).The first hour is a bit of torture, thankfully saved by the second hour, which turns the movie into something at least enjoyable. Taika Waititi gets to gobble up some scenery with some truly funny lines, but the best performances come from an amazingly daft Rebel Wilson as some kind of Nazi staffer Fraulein Rahm who likes guns and war far too much, and even better is an incredibly goofy Archie Yates as Yorki, who appears at all the right moments to deliver several good laughs.This, then, is the divisive point: would it not have been a better movie if it had been Yorki Rabbit, or at least investigate the concept of Yorki and Rahm."
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,8/10,"This is an artistic comedy with very serious undertones. The jokes are relatively funny, the kids are adorable, the undercurrent is poignant, the acting and cinematography is quite good and there's just enough chill in the movie to bring about the true nature of WW2. If you're looking for Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan then you are missing the point of this movie. It's exactly what it was supposed to be."
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"There is a certain charm to this film, despite the content that explores Nazi youth culture in a satirical way. The acting is fantastic from the young boy to the more-established stars in the film. No idea why Roman Griffin Davis was not nominated for an Oscar in the leading actor category. There are some Wes Anderson-type moments in the film, too, and that could make or break it for some viewers, of course, but those moments are brilliant. You will laugh with this film, and you will cry with it-at least twice. It's excellent commentary on modern political situations in the U.S., which probably hits too close to home for some conservatives. Highly recommend, as this film was better than _Parasite_ and way better than _1917_ in terms of its cinematic achievement."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,7/10,I didn't know what to expect going into this movie but I was happy with what I encountered. The most impressive feature is the acting skills of the child actors.
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,8/10,"When I first heard of the Movie I thought it would be the old same war movie however it is not, the film is rather a Comic-Drama and is about a 10 years old German child a Pro-Hitler and how things turnaround him as film progresses. The film is Bold and satirical in nature shows us about the Nazi's but in humorous way which I might think wont be taken well by The German's. However the film is crafted well by Taika Waititi. Highlighting the performance of Roman Griffin who is the showman of the movie. The young character with heavy dialogues and bold gestures portrayed with so much of conviction by Griffin which builds your interest in movie right from the first scene till its end. Scarlet Johansson as Griffin mother has a brief but impactful role and she has nailed it totally. Hard luck for her that she couldn't get any award for her role despite being nominated at several different awards including Academy Award for best supporting actress. Taika Waititi himself as Fanciful version of Adolf Hitler was funny and delightful."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,10/10,"Director Taiko Waititi who also wrote screenplay and acted as Hitler in the movie Jojo rabbit did a great job. Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo and then nicknamed Jojo rabbit by Sam Rockwell who is Captain Klenzendorf during WW II did extremely well as a 10yr old kid who adores Hitler and has Hitler as his imaginary friend. Meek & timid Jojo loves Hitler's uniform, his authority and his commands. Of course , only a sensible mom who has her feet on the ground recognizes the reasons why her child adores Hitler. Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mom Rosie is terrific. I enjoyed conversations, affection and love between Jojo and his mom Rosie. Having lost a daughter, Rosie tries to shelter and protect Jewish girl Elsa (Thomason McKenzie from Leave no trace) in her house. I thoroughly enjoyed the sweetness and niceness of a 10yr old in awe of Hitler and now liking a pretty , nice Jewish girl in his own home. Great movie . Jojo's friend, another 10yr old Yorki, excellent acting by Archie Yates added innocence, fun and purity of childhood to the movie. Superb movie. Great Direction. Excellent screenplay. Superb editing. Loved entire cast . And above all Scarlett Johansson and Roman Griffin Davis. Oscar worthy."
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,7/10,"Although the film is a good film, it is immediately clear that the direction taken is confused and slightly bad-articulated. Despite everything, again, it remains a good film with an excellent satirical message that succeeds perfectly in the intent with a beautiful adapted screenplay. The direction of Taika Waititi is good as long as it doesn't aspire to be a film beyond what has been seen."
JOJO RABBIT,25 April 2021,7/10,"Unfunny, boring for the most part, trying to be clever but isn't. Once it arrives at a truly serious moment, however, from that point forward it becomes a good film."
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,,"Taika Waititi delivers not only his best film to date but one of the finest films of 2019. It is everything you could want from a movie. Its funny, its sweet and has a lot of emotion plus its original and one of the best performed films of the year.
Roman Griffin Davis is really great here. He carrys this film. Everyone is exceptional here including Merchant, Johansson, McKenzie, Rockwell and Wilson (surprisingly). Taika Waititi is ace here. Delivering a rather genius and unique performance.
The whole style of the film is fresh and unique, thanks to Waititi being such an auteur and it's seriously well done. Waititi has a style which I adore. His direction and writing is seriously top notch quality here. And he manages to blend something serious with something funny yet at times really sad as well. It all pays off by the end. I had a blast with this film though. It's a 108 minute film without much fault. The third act really makes this film amazing.
Don't really have much wrong to say, sometimes the film doesn't always work with his style but that's few and far between and one scene didn't have the emotion, you would expect, other than that it is terrific. Definitely in the top 10 of 2019 so far."
JOJO RABBIT,3 June 2020,6/10,"Jojo Rabbit is no special movie. Although could be a bit funny, (maybe even insightful) but not a great movie.The extra saccharine adventures of Jojo seems like a crash course about the Third Reich meant for a kid's bed time story. It makes the whole World War seem like cheap survival TV game show.I totally get that, this is supposed to be an ""anti-hate"" movie. But potrayal of a war (not just any war but one of such a devastating scale) in this mockery is injustice.For instance, there is this particular scene where a bunch of soldiers are coming back from war and all what JoJo's mother has to tell them is ""go back home and kiss your mother"". As if all of it is just a bad dream and a kiss is what they all need. This paints a very bizarrely naive picture of wars. And in turn doesn't inspire you to feel bad about wars much.Maybe Waititi's intentions were that only. He meant his film not to be commentary on the politics or all the bad things that happened. Maybe he wanted the film to be bizarrely naive. But unfortunately that doesn't make this film any great.It is just a funny film which could be watched once and enjoyed with your family. It treads away very safely from touchy topics. Almost every character is lovable.A world from rose tinted glasses is always a delight to watch but doesn't do much of a service for the one's watching."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,9/10,"It is the final phase of second world war. The Allies are knocking at the threshold of Germany. But, it is business as usual in Berlin where our protagonist - ten year old Jojo Betzler considers himself the ideal Aryan as he prepares to join a weekend camp of indoctrination by Hitler Youth. The Fuhrer is his greatest idol and also imaginary best friend - a confidante with whom he has several personal conversations and seeks guidance. Jojo lives alone with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) while his father is away fighting in the war.Jojo aspires to rise through the ranks of Hitler Youth and become a personal bodyguard of the Fuhrer. But, underneath the facade of his Aryan pride, Jojo is a kind and sweet boy who flinches at hurting another being. JoJo's orderly world gets a bolt from the blue when he accidentally discovers that his mother has been hiding a much older jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic of their home. Jojo intends to betray Elsa to the authorities and regain some of his lost prestige by winning a medal for the act. But, he faces a dilemma as he feels that it could put his mother in peril.
Thus unfolds a coming-of-age drama that sees our little Jojo on a journey of self discovery of understanding his beliefs including the systematic indoctrination of hate he was subjected to despite his tender age.While most parts of the movie breezes through as a well made satire filled with oodles of irreverent and dark humour, these are interspersed with moments which are poignant and underline the grim realities of the time without resorting to any melodrama.Without being preachy, the movie casts its focus on how ideologies - howsoever well meaning - if let loose, could crush the idiosyncrasies that make us human and could convert us into unthinking automatons under the command of powers that be.Roman Griffin Davis is endearing and absolutely spot on as the vulnerable Jojo. Scarlett Johansson brings a natural warmth and mirth as JoJo's mother Rosie and richly deserves her Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. The talented Sam Rockwell shines in a short cameo while Waititi is having a whale of a time playing Hitler.Director Taika Waititi (Thor Ragnarok) has delivered an important movie which, despite being set during second world war, resonates strongly with our own times that is marked by a rising tide of restlessness and distrust across the globe."
JOJO RABBIT,25 March 2020,9/10,The core of comedy is tragedy .Think about reality after laughing.I like the director style very much.
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,1/10,"Oh. I get it. They're making a parody of a terrible event in history...WTF?!Considering this was directed by the man who did Thor: Ragnarok, I just can't can't believe what I'm seeing.It's not funny and has all the watchability of a bad SNL skit."
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,5/10,"Pros:
Great production value
Well acted, generally entertaining characters
Can be funny, funny takes on Nazis and the warCons:
Nothing too new in the story or characters besides the surface level
Themes and tone don't cooperate at all, creates a weird dissonanceBest part: Scarlet Jo death, out of left field and meant a lot for the story, fun twist
Worst part: summer camp, best example of how cliche and one dimensional the plot can get at times"
JOJO RABBIT,2 June 2020,2/10,"A young boy in Hitler's army finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.
I was disappointed in this film, acting was average, the storyline was mind numbing, WHY the high ratings ???!!!! It wasn't funny nor drama it was just a pointless of 2 hour. I reviewed it because it was so popular for so many weeks and the high ratings!!! And it won an Oscar??!!! Don't recommend it at all"
JOJO RABBIT,14 June 2020,2/10,"Promising start, rapidly falls into a house prison for the viewer. Whole budget must have gone to a small explosion and Johanson's paycheck. Can't believe the director got paid for that and already discourages any consideration of watching his future Star wars movie. There was some certain potential, but movie felt cheap and not worth of a cinema ticket or my time. I walked out in the middle and went to watch Curon series which was more interesting"
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2020,9/10,"This is a rare gem, a fine balance between the horror of war and genuinely funny moments. A unique piece of film that has you on the edge of your seat seeing through the eyes of Jojo. Pure genius."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2020,8/10,"Beautifully shot, cast, directed, written, acted. He is truly King Midas. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING he touches is gold...and fun...and hope. Scarlett got to peel another layer. Rockwell got to do do what he does best. New talent was discovered and allowed to shine in the presence of established of award winning stars. The material and subject matter, which, let's be honest, is a horse that has been beaten beyond dental records recognition, was treated with a breath of fresh air and perspective the likes of which is not rarely seen. It is never seen. If you have not yet, WATCH THIS MOVIE. That is all."
JOJO RABBIT,20 July 2020,9/10,"I went into this film expecting a pure comedy but I could not be more wrong. Jojo Rabbit offers some serious emotional resonance and profound themes. It was thoroughly entertaining throughout and the lighthearted nature of the film gives you a strong connection with the characters. By the end, you realize how smart the film actually is and how effective it is as a satire. You simply do not see many films like this one."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,8/10,I Thing Taika Waititi deserve the Oscar for this movie.the story was great the Actors and Actress were great.I enjoyed watching this movie. JoJo and his mom were Perfect.Scarlett Johansson should even elected as best actress in supporting role for that kind of perfect acting in this movie.I Couldn't stand when she just changed her face and became father of the son.That was great piece of work.
JOJO RABBIT,20 June 2020,8/10,"Very well made movie, with an anti war message, the young lad steals the show."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2021,8/10,"Most of the time, I find that IMDb ratings are a good and reliable indicator of quality. Perhaps I just have ""average"" taste.But, with ""Jojo Rabbit"" the rating is, I think, exactly right. I loved everything about this movie. The acting and the fake German accents were spot on, the script intelligent and very witty (""blowing schtuff up""), the direction tight and the locations impressive. The soundtrack was also well considered and complemented the movie perfectly. I especially liked The Beatles ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" in German and the version of ""Heroes"", sung in German over the end titles was a real highlight for me.I was particularly impressed that the people who made the movie managed to engage two real stars in Scarlett Johannson and Sam Rockwell, both of whom I thought were excellent, particularly Sam.I wasn't quite sure about this one before I watched it but now, while I don't expect that I'll watch it very often, it's definitely in my list for repeat viewing.I haven't read other reviews of this movie yet but I imagine there are at least some that go on about making light of Hitler and the Nazis and their treatment of Jewish people. Such criticism would I think rather miss the point.I'm an Australian. Well done my friends across the pond for this little gem of a movie. I enjoyed this one much more than the tedious and drawn out ""Lord of the Rings"" and the even more tedious and drawn out ""Hobbit"".JMV"
JOJO RABBIT,4 April 2020,6/10,"Not a ""formal"" movie or thoughtful plot. No new knowledge. A little low and silly. But it is funny and nice entertainment made by American."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a great film in my view because it perfectly nails the balance between humour, emotion but also sensitivity. The sensitivity required to address the context of Nazi Germany.The screenplay is brilliant (based on Christine Leunens' Caging Skies) as it drives the audience through a wide range of emotions. I laughed quite a bit, I nearly cried but I also spent plenty of time discussing the subject matter after the final scene. A fair BAFTA and Oscar winner.The film follows the main character Jojo, a Nazi-party-loving 10-year old. Through him, we see the power of education and context in creating hate and admiration for a leader. The fact that same leader, Hitler, is Jojo's trusted imaginary friend is genius. Their relationship is incredibly refreshing from a story telling perspective.When Jojo finds out that his own mother is harbouring a Jewish girl, all of his beliefs are questioned.""Supporting"" actors are a joy to watch in this movie - from Scarlett Johansson's devote and resolute mother, to Sam Rockwell's disgruntled Nazi officer and the touching Thomasin McKensie as the the Jewish refugee. Not to mention the director's Taika Wakiki own take on Adolf Hitler as a supportive yet firm imaginary best friend.I definitely cherish living in a time where this movie can get made (apparently despite many struggles since 2011). Where humour and satire are valued as a lenses for an incredibly dark part of human history. And it does not hurt your emotional attachment to the characters one bit."
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,2/10,"A real Nazi would step on the blue butterfly. At Hitler Youth camp, older boys teach the younger ones to be dispassionate towards killing. By the time these youngsters are done with this program of systemic brainwashing, the newly-minted soldier will have no harder time shooting a man in the head than twisting a rabbit's neck. A ten-year-old boy, that's all Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis) is, caught up in the wrong place and time on this spinning green planet, but Berlin circa 1945 happen to be his fate, making him ten in dog years. His relative innocence is barbed, however, since the boy, despite lacking the killer instinct to fatally injure small forest creatures, the little Nazi desperately wants to be a credit to the German race. He wants to be like everybody else. Because of this guilt, Adolph Hitler(Taika Waititi) repeatedly appears as his imaginary friend, rooting Jojo on to be evil. It's not a matter of Jojo objecting to party ideology; he believes that an Aryan has absolute power over the animal kingdom. His inherent goodness embarrasses him; he places the rabbit on the ground and shoos him. The Fuhrer of Jojo's own making has filmic DNA traceable to the camp counselor Bill Murray plays in Ivan Reitman's ""Meatballs"". Waititi, in fact, seems to be channeling Tripper in the next scene, when Jojo returns to his group with the same anarchic spirit, running encouragingly alongside the Rudy-like(Chris Makepeace) kid, as if throwing a live grenade was an event in the Olympiad. Jojo's shame derives, not from some moral failure of the fatherland, but rather, what he sees as his own personal failure in regard to treating the murder of lesser lives, both human and animal, as a good soldier's mandate without tears. The kid is a zealot; he has Nazimania. Jojo lives with the enemy; Rosie(Scarlett Johannsen), his own mother, the real hero of ""Jojo Rabbit"". Unbeknownst to Jojo, the mother is anti-fascist and an unequivocal Jewish sympathizer. It's a man's world, even if the boy is not yet a man. Despite being older than him, Jojo is master of the house. Rosie knows, with some certainty, that her ten-year-old son would hand Elsa(Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl she hides behind a hollowed-out wall, over to the gestapo for not being blonde with blue eyes. Jojo, unapologetically, is an anti-Semite; a jarring political position, to be sure, for a comedy. The boy plays mind games with his mother, greedily eating Rosie's two bread slices that she had planned on saving for Elsa. Jojo knows her mother's secret. It's a discreet interrogation with the goal of entrapping his mother for her role in harboring a known enemy; a treasonous act punishable by death. Because of Jojo's tender age, labeling him as the hero seems only natural, but ""Jojo Rabbit"" is not that simple. Rosie loves her son, but he is a stranger in her own house. Ultimately, Jojo pays the price for buying into party-line propaganda about Germans being human civilization's master race. The butterfly leads Jojo to a pair of dangling legs. The shoes belong to his mother. ""Jojo Rabbit"", directed by Taika Waititi, doesn't seem aware, just like its complicated protagonist, how Rosie ended up in a public square, swinging at the gallows. Does the filmmaker actually believe that Jojo deserves recognition as being one of the heroes, the David Bowie song's namesake that accompanies the scene in which Elsa realizes the American soldiers have liberated her?This boy is not a hero.Let's rewind.Dagger in hand, Jojo finally works up the nerve to kill, or rather, go through the motions, because cold-blooded murder is not really in his DNA, which continues to be a constant source of humiliation. For the fuhrer, the schutzstaffel, and most of all, his mother, he stabs Elsa near the shoulder. The Jewish girl stops the knife's forward momentum, but not before it breaks skin, enough to draw blood and leave a miniscule splotch on her blouse. Elsa probably knows why German authorities had stopped by unannounced to sweep the house for contraband humans, yet the illegal girl, despite being maimed, willingly plays the scapegoat, as an act of magnanimity. Impersonating Jojo's deceased sister. Elsa got the birthdate wrong on Inge's identification papers when Captain Klezendorf(Sam Rockwell) quizzes her. If not for the captain's fondness for this ten-year-old loyalist, Elsa would have been outed immediately, placed under arrest, and processed for deportation, on the next train to Auschwitz. Rosie's fate is sealed, the audience realizes, in retrospect, when Klezendorf asks Jojo if his mother ""spends much time at home"". This pint-sized Nazi, the audience needs to remember, since ""Jojo Rabbit"" can, at times, be confused for Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"", that the kid is a real patriot who bought hook, line, and sinker, every fiction about the inferiority of the Jewish race as objective fact. Chillingly, Rosie never broaches the subject of his party's amorality with Jojo because she knows that mentors such as Captain Klezendorf had turned her son into an automaton, a robot, so to speak. Case and point, the boy catches his mother distributing leaflets which read: ""Free Germany!"" under the guise of a robot, while out collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Replace the robot costume with a soldier's uniform, and suddenly, it's easier to gauge the ideological war at home as a trenchant one. Does Jojo know about ethnic cleansing? Most likely. The boy doesn't interject as Elsa, who wrongly equates her loss with his, explains that she, too, has been orphaned. Jojo, plain and simple, talks too much. Too many times to too many people, Jojo asks about the proper course of action should he spot a dislocated Jew; a hypothetical so thinly-veiled, even Yorki(Archie Yates), a conscripted soldier his own age, understands intuitively that somebody of non-Aryan descent lives under his roof. Did Yorki, a young ideologue like his best friend, put together: ""I have a girlfriend now,"" with ""I captured a Jew,"" and report this to Captain Klezendorf, corroborating what he already knew from Jojo's own unwitting testimony. There is, after all, no love lost between the captain and Rosie, who knees him in the crotch and slaps him across the cheek with a black glove, right in front of his bureaucratic subordinates, after she learns that Jojo nearly blew himself up with a grenade under Klezendorf's command. Played as comedy, the audience laughs, but the debased captain, it should be noted, would have been a soldier in the Waffen-SS if not for his handicap; a defective left eye. More likely than not, Klezendorf reported Jojo's mother to the gestapo, as revenge for his public humiliation, and lest we forget, because he's a Nazi.The titular character in Cate Shortland's ""Lore"", a 2012 historical drama about the outset of postwar Germany, just like Jojo, has to unlearn everything she was taught as a Hitler Youth. Hannalore Dressler(Saskia Rosendahl), the oldest daughter of a high-ranking Nazi officer, during her long trek, accompanied by four younger siblings to Omi's house, accepts, begrudgingly, the help of Thomas(Kai Malima), a concentration camp survivor, and sees for herself, slowly over their shared experiences as provisional allies, that Jewish people don't smell like ""brussel sprouts"" and have horns concealed under their hair. Omi tells her: ""You must never feel ashamed of them. Your parents did nothing wrong."" Ironically, these are the words that Jojo has to wrestle with; he was indeed ashamed of Rosie for being unpatriotic, and his father, too; a war deserter. Over time, the boy will realize that he, albeit unintentionally, informed on his own mother. Rosie died because she was living with a party loyalist. The boy could not separate the political from the personal. Jojo's shame, the longer he gets to know Elsa, will grow exponentially, and finally, one day, he'll realize with perfect lucidity that his mother was the real patriot, and did nothing wrong. His mom; his beautiful mom, who tried to teach him that real Germans sing and dance, fall in and out of love; not kill, was right.For the time being, Jojo isn't quite there yet. ""Jojo Rabbit"" doesn't seem to understand that Elsa suffers from Stockholm Syndrome. Jojo used this Jewish girl as research for a book-in-progress about the origins of her people. Elsa is leaving Berlin with the boy who stabbed her.""Lore"" ends with the holocaust, a metaphoric one. Hannalore's mother, the wife of a war criminal, kept a porcelain menagerie on her dresser as a young girl. A doe at repose, Mutti's favorite that the oldest daughter carried with her from home; she saves for last, crushing this memento of her family's Nazi-affiliated past with the heel of a ""store-bought"" shoe. She scatters the porcelain animal body parts on her mother's dresser, mirroring the black and white photos of the concentration camps.As a young girl, an officer's daughter, Hannalore would have snapped that rabbit's neck without any hesitation. She would have been one of the girls snickering at Jojo's reluctance to kill the rabbitJojo was a mama's boy.This horrified him.After the song is over, and the dancing stops, that's when the real horror begins.Lore had bad parents, whereas Jojo's mother was Jojo Lioness, but the cub couldn't see the urban sprawl of the German forest for the trees."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" embodies what cinema should be: a rollercoaster ride of emotions packed with an important message. And starting with this last aspect, the movie is about a young boy who lives in Germany during the Nazi period. His mother teaches him the values of love and respect while the society inculcates him the Nazi ideology, which is the one he grows with. So at the age of ten he is a blind fanatic but it's clear from the beginning that he posses some of his mother's lessons that he rejects strongly. The encounter with a jewish girl that his mother is hiding in their house is the start of an evolution of Jojo's personality and I stop here as far as the plot. I can say that this is the setting of a satire about the Nazi ideology, that makes fun of it and shows how stupid it is. The other aspect I mentioned is the ride of emotions. The great thing about ""Jojo Rabbit"" is that you enter the movie and you have almost two hours in which you feel every emotions: I laughed a lot and in some cases I lost it, I felt pressure and anxiety, I was moved by sadness and by joy. And all this emotions were perfectly balanced in the flow of the movie. I am a big Taika Waititi's fan and in this movie he outdid himself. Other than the plot itself, which I've talked enough about, the direction, the cinematography and the score were great as well. And also the cast did a great job: Roman Griffin Davis was outstanding, Thomasin McKenzie was great as well, Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell lived up to their very high standards and Taika Waititi was a fantastic Hitler.
What can I say other than I fell in love with this movie? Watch it if you haven't yet, this is filmmaking at his best form!"
JOJO RABBIT,3 November 2019,,"This is camp, not genius. How Jojo Rabbit has manged to garner generally good reviews is a mystery to me. I'd take a pass on it if I were you."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"I would not call this film a comedy and although it has it's satirical moments and quite a lot of them this is more of a drama... The film tells a story from a completely unexpected perspective, one that you might have wondered but never saw in reality and that is what it makes it so brilliant... The main idea is to show how a person might slowly realise that the ideology one was taught might not be true and how a world of that person might fall apart bit by bit to realise the truth. The acting is superb, the kids both deserve an Oscar, so does Scarlet Johanson, because it might be her best dramatic role... The film comes at a right time, when the far right ideologies started to dominate the world and things like Brexit start to happen and fuel hatred for each other... Ironically but the film itself also has a certain ideology, the women characters are portrayed with stronger personalities maybe except Captain Klenzendorf which although is portrayed as a secret gay but turns out to be a hero... There was also one overweight brainwashed Nazi lady whose purpose was to show what having 14 children can do to your body...So although I enjoyed the film a great deal it has a certain feminism ideology to it, but maybe with just the right balance..."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,9/10,"I was weary of watching this one due to articles that discussed how wrong it is to make comedic films about real life tragedies. However, this film isn't fully a comedy, nor is it entirely a drama. It has a balance of both. I'm glad I watched this film rather than go by the articles written by people who just don't get it, though they like think to they do; ""it"" meaning anything having to do with discrimination, sexism, etc. & that's coming from a woman of color.I laughed, I cried, I cheered (at imaginary Hitler's fate at the end) it was a fantastic watch. The boy playing Jojo is adorable, his expressions were great, you can truly see him emotionally growing as a character as the movie progresses. Rebel Wilson was hilarious, as expected. Don't be offended by the story her nazi character tells by the pool, it's to show the absurdity of nazi mentality. I don't understand why critics bashed Scarlett Johansson's performance in this film. She was great and I loved her character. Ignore the critics that say she didn't give as much to this performance or I even came across one that said ""she wasn't comedic enough"", she was fantastic. She played the role as she should have and I hope she gets proper recognition for it. As for Waititi's Hitler, he takes the Charlie Chaplin route in making Hitler seem as ridiculous as possible, which when looking at that waste of space for what he was, is quite accurate. The difference is this Hitler didn't make me laugh as much as Chaplin's Hitler. He's meant to be comedic relief but didn't really do it for me. That was the one thing that didn't do it for me. It's an ""I get it, it ain't making me laugh, but I get it"" sort of thing.All in all, as you can tell by now, I loved this film and it deserves all the praise it's getting. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed. If you are, well it's okay to be wrong sometimes. Congrats to the cast and crew on making such an amazing film."
JOJO RABBIT,4 August 2020,1/10,"I have NO idea what movie all these people saw, I was expecting a COMEDY.
This is the typical ""everyone SAYS it was great, so ILL say it's great too!
This was a movie that made me feel was written for the humor of a 5 yr old, by some one not too funny to begin with. I felt actually embarrassed and a little dumber for watching the 45 minutes I HAD to sit through to be sure I wasn't missing some great masterpiece.
I love comedy, everything from Monty python, to napoleon dynamite.
I've laughed at every movie and genre in between and trust me, this movie is NOT funny.
It's a poor choice of topic, that isn't even clever, like ""hitler in springtime"" as in the producers.
Trust me, don't waste your time, but if you DO, remember I tried to warn you."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,4/10,"Let's cut right to the chase: Jojo Rabbit is every bit as original and effective a satire as Hogan's Heroes. It takes precisely the same approach to the Nazis, broadly caricaturing them as bumbling idiots and two-dimensional bullies. So it's no surprise that JoJo suffers from exactly the same problem as Hogan's Heroes: there's nothing real or threatening or genuinely sinister about these Nazis. They're just buffoons. Perhaps JoJo is marginally more daring in going so far as to depict Hitler himself, but Waititi's Fuhrer is as flimsy and fey as Mel Brook's take on him in Springtime For Hitler - only without the biting, derisive satire and the consistent hilarity. How funny you find JoJo Rabbit will likely depend on whether you also find The Three Stooges and Road Runner cartoons laugh-out-loud funny, for that's the level of most of what passes for humour here. If this is what passes for ""comedy genius"" and 10 out of 10 film-making in the 21st century, then heaven help us all."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,8/10,"Wasn't too sure what too expect of this film but the longer I watched, the better it got. Great characters and scenery. The war, from the German side, through a child's eyes. Loved it. You laugh and you cry - shows the devastation, tragedy and ultimately the hope that exists in war. Taika is going from strength to strength...."
JOJO RABBIT,14 November 2020,8/10,"If this was made today, people would be freaking out over making jokes about Nazis. Oh, wait, they already did.Get a grip, people. Hogans Heroes and the Producers were made in the 60s when there were many people who had the horror of WW2 fresh in their memory. I'd bet that nearly everyone complaining about the Nazi jokes are millennials being being politically correct for stupid reasons.
Plus, many of today's acclaimed 'comedies' are more tasteless than this and less funny. Just Google 'best comedies of the 21st century' and watch the crap appear like magic."
JOJO RABBIT,23 March 2020,7/10,"Very well played by the little boy and beautifully implemented visually (camera, costumes etc.). The slapstick character of this comedy at times seems to banalize the tough subject (war, Holocaust) and the feelings underneath the laughs don't come across sufficiently. This also can't be a film for children, because they would need to know enough about the Nazis, the War and the Shoah in order to not be misguided by the humor and its potential belittlement. I haven't read the original book but am surprised this film won an Oscar for its script. Again, worthwhile to see for the acting, visual storytelling and forming an own opinion."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,9/10,"I always like it when filmmakers try something different and it pays off. And this certainly seemed to accomplish that task. It's not entirely a dark comedy. But it's also definitely irreverent and crazy at times. It's also not a drama. But it has poignant heartfelt moments. And it's not a Pixar kids movie either. It's certainly a movie for a mature audience. And it works.Most movies that try to make a movie in both comedy and drama realms have the two ends compromises the resolve of one other realm to a point where neither works. And the audience feels the tone should have been predominantly one or the other.So why does this one work with both realms? I think it works because the comedy sequences are a result of naive situations for the lead character and his sidekick. It's the character's obliviousness rather than intentional jokes that makes his dramatic transition still work. Additionally the story is goofy enough at the beginning to get the audience comfortable with the absurd moments and situations infiltrating important moments which arise later. It also was not being afraid to give some dramatic moments for more comedic characters near the beginning.As for the faults, I thought some of the stuff at the end could have been shown a little clearer and at a quicker pace. Also, one of the character's motivations became a bit unclear at times near the end when it would have been good for the motivations to be a bit clearer at that point.But I look forward to seeing this movie again. I had a lot of fun at the cinema.Also, if any big Broadway production company is watching, I think this film could be made into a fabulous musical. This film reminded me a bit of West Side Story, The Producers, Urinetown and Billy Elliot. Apart from The Producers these Broadway shows similarly effectively walk the line between being comedies and dramas."
JOJO RABBIT,5 March 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit tries to introduce the scenes in a funny way but it's not comedy at all, after going 1 hour into the movie the last 30 minutes of the movie was the time i knew i liked the movie, at first it tries to be funny but then the events change to sadness, so here is the question would it have been better if the comedy was excluded? I can say yes if it was going on the drama line the story would been more emotional and sadness that would been more effective on our feelings what if no staying on what it is i appreciate how good it is but comedy is not there, The three main characters good job the kid Jojo (Roman Griffin) easily goes into our heart the girl Elsa (Thomasin Mckenzie) proofs her worthy and the mom Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) needs to drop more on drama genre and all others were greatly appreciated, the movie can keep you alive with it's colourful and great setup, the ending of it liked it after the character growth was done from first to last,
at the end it's like a (2 in 1) taste, highly recommended for drama fans, 8/10⭐"
JOJO RABBIT,11 September 2020,10/10,"This movie Jojo Rabbit is well-known last year before the Covid-19 pandemic time, I really really enjoy it This movie represents how the ordinary daily lives of Young Hitlers soldiers, being under doctrine, having false image mentality about winning, and several distrust of the Jewish people. The appearance of Hitler as imaginary friend makes this movie more fun and more lively to be watched with everybody in your living room during Lockdown. The story line is simple, but the plots, scenes, character developments, and surprises are still coming to our way to realize about what is missing during moment of war and who is our true friend during difficult time. I love the way Director can give strong commitment to create focus on main character by giving the title Jojo Rabbit, that makes him more curiosity about himself and questioning many things, including where is his soldier father, what is Jewish, who is Hitler, and many more. I can not find any lackness of this masterpiece. So modern, dramatic, fun, and critical at some points. This is not one-time-watching movie. This is legend."
JOJO RABBIT,10 October 2020,8/10,"This is one of the few movies that can actually make me laugh out loud, the jokes are very smart and the movie handles the ww2 time period very well. Not only is it a funny movie but it's a movie that actually has something to say and I found myself tearing up a couple of times. One of my favorite comedys"
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,7/10,"Good movie, it was funny, it was sad, it also did a good job ...for the MOST part to be historically accurate - 10-11 year olds were not asked to fight in the ""Battle of Berlin"", age 14 and up yes, but not little kids.The Hitler Youth was also not done right at all, they were basically the Boy Scouts of Germany, not taught to be desensitized to war -Germany was actually one of the most civilized nations on Earth (historians still question how this all was able to happen in at that time, a VERY sophisticated Liberal nation), and while the Nazi party was pretty radical, the typical German/German boy was just like anyone else.That's a minor gripe though because I get that this was a comedy, and they did an excellent job showing the humanity even among those like the Captain. (when he covers for Elsa)I was very surprised to see overall how accurate the uniforms were, and how at the end they showed the elderly being shown how to defend the city, as this happened. They also showed a brief sense of the brutality of the Soviets - who raped an estimated 2.5 million German women, and murdered millions of people after the war had ended. I'm fully aware Germany did horrible things on the Eastern front, but this film is specifically about Germans.The Gestapo was done, while for comic effect - well. Even the German military and to an extent even the SS feared them. No, they didn't have to ""Heil Hitler"" like that, lol it was done for comedic effect.The acting was AMAZING, was never a fan of Scarlett but she was great. Elsa, and JoJo were both awesome as well. Though some accents were very off, such as JoJos adorable friend having an English accent lol. Oh, and Rebel Wilson can be funny! WHO KNEW!!! But I felt the H.Y Captain stole the show!!!I may seem like I came at this from the wrong POV. But I actually found it to be really great!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 July 2021,10/10,"I originally got tickets because I expected this to be just some sensless comedy with pro-nazi undertones. What I didn't expect was deep sighs and tears at the end. The movie actually had a lot to say and the comedy worked extremely well. The acting is great, even for the child actors. I could go as far and call this a masterpiece, it just works!"
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,1/10,"No, there is nothing funny about a blond boy who is educated in hating Jews. No, there is nothing funny about an imaginary Adolf Hitler telling a Hitlerjugend boy nazi clichés. The subject is too serious. If you like Hitler satire, watch Mel Brooks' To Be Or Not To Be, not this garbage. 8 stars of 10 is an insult, when it deserves something between 0 and 1. Yet I'd like to write something nice about this film and it's the ending. The last 20 are actually pretty decent but don't really compensate the first 80 minutes of nonsense."
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,9/10,"First of all, this movie does an incredible job of juggling around its tones. This is a comedy movie at its finest but it's also a serious movie and Taika Waititi, who wrote, directed and plays Adolf Hitler, did a spectacular job of juggling them and knowing when to make a joke and when to hold back for the more serious scenes. Not a lot of movies are able to this and it helps this movie stand out among the rest. With the movie switching tones, the cast has to be able to switch to and man oh man did they get great actors for this movie. From the seasonal actors that we all know to the up and coming kid actors everybody just did a stellar job. There were two actors that really stood out to me and that was Roman Griffin Davis and Taika Waititi. I learned this online and I wanted to share this because it's just funny but one reason why Taika Waititi was amazing as Adolf Hitler is because he's Jewish so getting to play a silly version of him is just the biggest fork you, sorry but I had to say it, to him. Even not knowing that information he's still hilarious in this role. But the real stand out definitely was Roman Griffin Davis as the title character. This is his first film role, at least that's what IMDB told me, and he definitely has a bright future ahead of himself. He easily switched from comedic and drama so effortlessly that it made for an interesting main character with depth to him. In the end, Jojo Rabbit is a great movie that when it's released on DVD and Blue-Ray I highly recommended checking it out, you won't regret it."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,10/10,"At the beginging i thought I am watching a comedy, but at the end I saw a wonderful movie, what a sight, what a point of view of the Second War World, I really love it, on my personal opinion it is a master piece"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"Dramatic film, sometimes funny. Beautiful photography especially the portraits. Nice story with an epic ending, Heroes soundtrack German version of David Bowie. A film that can make us understand the uselessness of war, the difficult topic of the Holocaust is treated in an extraordinary way. A simple satire, the feelings are engaging."
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,8/10,"""The Joker's Whimsical World"" unveiled the real world wrapped in icing with a brisk and smooth rhythm, turning the boy's growth story from blind obedience to questioning into a warm and sad war fairy tale. I can fully feel it. The director tries to tell through the film the loss and gain, pain and joy, imitation and courage that may be experienced in the growth process, and amplify the nature of love and hope in life. Personally, I have recently seen many movies that describe children entering the adult world, but only ""The Joker's Whimsical World"" can make such a huge contrast without any child inappropriate lens, which is quite strong. Resonance and reflection space.I like ""The Young Man's Whimsical World"" to bring out the ruthless wars of the Second World War era through the characters' views and mood changes, and the contrast highlights the warmth and preciousness of emotions between family and family. The whole movie is full of emotions, not only playing the role of the director of the boy 's imaginary father Hitler, Taiga Viditi, but also the supporting roles of Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. The audience saw that even in the most cruel times, there are many things that we should cherish. Just as the Jews are no different from us, the children in Nazi Germany are also so naive."
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a fun movie, funny dialogues between characters and a lot of funny scenes. Every time Taika Waititi was on screen I laughed so hard. Watch it, but you may not like the movie, it divide a lot of critics. In my opinion this is a fun movie with good acting and great actors."
JOJO RABBIT,13 May 2021,10/10,A roller coaster movie. It manages to be comedic without undermining the tragedy in the film. The comedy somehow emphasizes the awfulness of the situation. Very difficult to do and handled so well.
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,8/10,"Taika does it again!
My expectations were high after seeing some of Taika's previous movies, and I was not disappointed. Surprisingly emotional, actually. Jojo Rabbit is full of great acting, and subtle jokes for those who were watching closely, Jojo putting up a Hitler poster for instance and Taika's face changing as his hand moved over the image.Jojo and Elsa were awesome. Funny, and charismatic. Taika has had a good track work now working with young kids (Hunt for the Wilderpeople). Steven Merchant as always was crack up. Would've been good to see a bit more of him. The subtly of Jojo's mum's disapperance was also so well done, just as I started wondering where she'd been, BAM! Confronted with the reality of it all.Taika is so good at balancing humour and emotional rawness. He also provided a rare perspective in the child of Nazi Germany, one I hadn't considered. You can see his passion in this coming through for his heart towards Indigenous communities in NZ and the beauty of seeing life from another perspective or the humanness of us all. Great film!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 February 2020,10/10,"It's a really weird idea, it's a cutesy Wes Anderson/Calvin & Hobbes-style comedy about a little boy, his imaginary friend and his adventures growing up. It just so happens that that little boy is a Hitler Youth, his imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler and he's growing up in Nazi Germany during WWII. This movie is very funny. It has a ton of comedy both light and very dark! Don't be fooled, though. This is less The Producers or Look Who's Back and more Life is Beautiful. There are some seriously heavy and tragic parts in this movie that I don't dare spoil here. While it is a commentary about how childish the whole idea of Naziism is, it is also about the horrors of indoctrination and intolerance and the damages they can inflict. Great performances, beautiful costumes and cinematography and with a brilliant script, this is a must-see! One of my favourites of 2019!"
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,1/10,"The trailer for the film could not be more misleading. It represents the film as a bright, brilliant, laugh-a-minute, over-the-top, farce-like extravaganza. It's not. It drags. Oh, does it drag. It virtually stops dead in its tracks. Scenes that should be 2-3 minutes go on and on. Characters and situations that are funny are few and far between. My problem, unlike other reviewers here, is not with the subject matter. Sure it's not everyone's cup of tea. But whether or not you feel the subject is film-worthy, this is a dead film. As was the audience at my screening."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,10/10,"The splendid Waititi cleverly steered his brilliant cast through a superb adaptation to leave viewers wondering how he consistently pulls (Jojo) rabbits from his hat.
A great lineup of actors did their characters proud throughout the movie, with youngsters Roman Griffiths Davies (Jojo Rabbit) & Thomasin McKenzie (Elsa) stealing the show amidst the likes of the well-known: excellent Sam Rockwell and Scarlet Johanssen and Steve Merchant with my sincere admiration for ALL of the main ""speaking part"" actors!
My response is a definite ""Yes, in a heartbeat"" to ""Will you watch it again?""
And hey, c'mon Taika, what's next?"
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,10/10,"This film threads a fine satirical fiber through a sensitive needle's eye, bringing a new perspective, and relevance to the ramifications of ignorance; fascism, suffering, trauma. It deploys the most adorable face and character ever brought to the screen, making the story accessible to new generations while retaining a modicum of dignity and respect. There is no doubt that the truth is far graver than depicted in this film, though horrific, the warmth from the characters belies the depth of the pain and suffering. But, it does so knowingly, from the first scene, with a Beatle's song, that reminds you that this film will not be a serious one. Instead, it is whimsical, and obviously drawn from the imagination of one with only second-hand understanding of WW2. But it checks many fantasy scenarios that have occupied wandering minds of the generations of people who followed the one that actually dealt with the scourge of the Nazi party, and other movements that resemble it. It reminds us of the simple fact that war is senseless, in an off-beat though endearing manner. It is always refreshing to hear familiar stories told by those with diverse perspectives because it reassures us of our value system's credentials by revealing just how universally accepted are the fundamental principles of respect, dignity, justice, and trust."
JOJO RABBIT,1 May 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is about a German boy named Jojo who at an early age already has blind fanaticism towards Adolf Hitler. He joins the youth branch of Hitler's army but succumbs to an injury that basically renders him unfit in their eyes. He later finds out that a Jewish girl named Elsa lives secretly in their house and tries to make her talk about her kind so he can write a book exposing them which will gain him favor once again from the youth army so he can stop being relegated to meager so he can be at the forefront of the war along with his second-best friend Yorki (because Hitler deserves the top spot.) In the process he falls in love with Elsa and becomes torn between blindly serving his country and his own realization that someone isn't necessarily evil because you were led to believe that they were. We know how World War II ended but how will it be for Elsa who wants freedom and Jojo who doesn't want to lose her?While watching, I had my reservations whether this should've been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars this year. I have to admit that I initially rated it as an okay film midway through. But when that pivotal scene when Jojo was looking at Johannson's shoes, it sent shivers to my spine. It's non-stop rollercoaster from then on and for me it sealed its well-deserved nomination. Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) helmed the screenplay as well as direction and acted as Hitler. I love his decision to show how colorful Germany was in the WWII (which is backed up by research) as opposed to what we're used to, seeing it dreary in gray and black. Scarlett Johannson as Jojo's mother was likable but I failed to see the nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Sam Rockwell channeling Bill Murray was inspired, Rebel Wilson had the most memorable line, and Alfie Allen I felt was underused but I don't blame him if he wanted to be in on this. Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa was a picture of strength and elegance. But the movie really belonged to its child actors, Archie Yates as Yorki and Roman Griffin Davies as Jojo. Initially I did not like Davies but warmed up to him by the end and I realized it's because he convincingly played a loyal Hitler fan in the beginning that had a change of heart. Yates and Davies have good comic timing considering this is the first acting gig for both.Waititi said one of the reasons he made this is because of the behavior of some who's forgotten how evil and ugly WWII was and he wanted this to serve as one of the reminders. It's true that historical revision is on the rise, Nazis being adored, Marcoses are back in power despite multiple references available to how they plundered the Philippines during Martial Law and many others. The saying we are bound to repeat history if we don't learn from it holds so much weight right now. While it is almost next to impossible to talk about opposing views without hurting each other's feelings, Jojo Rabbit reminds us to ask ourselves one question each time you're engaged in a debate: WERE YOU KIND? Because at the end of the day you may be wrong about your philosophy which others will forget eventually, but how you treated them will leave an impression that will last a lifetime. Hitler in the movie said it is up to you if you want to be remembered. He failed to say it's also important HOW and WHAT you will be remembered for."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2020,6/10,"The best thing about this film is the premise: a young boy growing up in a little town in war time Germany believes has Hitler as an imaginary friend. Unfortunately the movie does not really satisfy the promise of that proposition. It is eager to set up the innocence and whimsy of youth against the misery of war and the ludicrous buffoonery of Nazism. But it unfortunately doesn't quite fill that gap.It is a funny movie. Yet it is not a comedy. At the core of the film is the relationship between Jojo and his mother. It is the very definition of bittersweet. The mother has not only the difficult task of raising Jojo alone, but she is also engaged in some sort of resistance movement. Jojo on the other hand has completely fallen to antisemetic propaganda and is very proud to be a devoted Nazi, and he is living his childhood without understanding the world around him nor the ideas he pretends to love so much.It is an interesting dynamic, and you almost did not need the wacky Hitler insert. Yet, the tension of this relationship is not necessarily apparent, until Jojo finds a girl living in the attic. And it is through her that, unbeknownst to the mother, that Jojo goes back from fervent Nazi to eleven year old-boy. The girl in the attic is the element that makes him connect with his mother in a way he could not do directly. Elsa is also the way we the audience learn about the mother in a more intimate way. We see that she maintains a distance towards Jojo, obviously in order to protect him, and furthermore to protect his innocence.Now that being said, the movie leans way more wacky than serious. And that is where I disengaged. The story has something real to show, but it gets distracted by gags and eccentric Nazi characters. Jojo and Elsa's confrontation is by essence juvenile; but then the other characters also operate in this quirky funny tone: the army officers are secretly flamboyantly gay, the Gestapo officer is ridiculous, the children are way too indoctrinated. None of it is bad or unfunny, but it diverts from the emotional arc.It is minor nitpick, but the movie portrays Nazis as the image that pop-culture has assigned to them. Not that it makes a difference, but I feel it would have been more interesting if the movie had taken a more realistic historic approach. In this film the Nazis are stereotypical. They are not an oppressive machine nor a threat to freedom, they are just there to be antisemites and being oblivious.There was an interesting theme going with Sam Rockwell's character, as the shell-shocked veteran, but the film left it unexplored.During the film, I was reminded of how La Vita è Bella was aiming for a similar premise: second world war though the eyes of a child, and how good that movie was. Jojo Rabbit may be a modern update of that story, but it does not quite measure to it. The difference being that La vita e bella was less plastic, it was less reliant on wacky tricks to get you to agree with it. Jojo Rabbit is clever and funny but it does not quite touch at the heartstrings in the same way."
JOJO RABBIT,31 August 2020,8/10,"It is rare to find a movie, especially a comedy, that is so well conceived with an adapted screen play as good as this one (by the book's author see Oscar Win)and to top it off so well executed ( no pun). It should make us all go revisit the 1967 Mel Brook's film ' Springtime for Hitler.' What is most endearing about this movie is how ridiculous the adults sound delivering their lines and how candid and perceptive not too mention funny the children sound delivering theirs when theyr'e just stating the truth, for example a chubby ten year old saying, "" it's not a good time to be a Nazi "". And the the funny lines come when your not expecting them which makes them all the more delicious. I had no idea how much I would enjoy this film and almost didn't see it; don't miss it, truly a comedic masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,16 July 2020,8/10,"They use a very interesting style to showcase a story in the context of war. It involves love, hate, laughter, and tragedy. So it covers a lot of emotions for the viewer. That makes it a great ride through the whole plot."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a fascinating satire that succeeds with its comedy while giving very powerful emotional moments as well. The film stands out for the way Jojo's character act is crafted. His firm Nazi posture is challenged with the natural opposite (having to hide a Jew girl in his house, with whom he ends up falling in love). Every single character in the movie is there for a purpose in Jojo's arc. Jojo's mom, Elsa (the Jew girl), Yorki or even Captain Klenzendorf are there to ultimately push Jojo into challenging his own ideals, and what he believes is right and wrong. Hitler is there as a personification of Jojo's ideals, as well as a resistance to change in his morals. Just as these characters, the plot forces change in Jojo in a subtle, natural and believable way. Whether is his mother's dead or the Nazis losing the war, these situations end up pushing Jojo into his ultimate change.Overall, a great film. I really loved 1917, and I want it to win the Oscar to Best Motion Picture. However, I wouldn't be mad at all if Jojo Rabbit wins. It's a great film and it would be great to see a comedy film win the prize."
JOJO RABBIT,13 August 2020,8/10,The satirical approach for such a sensitive topic is just genius.
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,9/10,I think it's been awhile since we see a WW2 film with the Germans perspective and seeing this film makes it look like a controversy waiting to happen...which makes people want to see the movie. The first Taika Waititi film I watched was Thor Ragnarok and I actually loved the movie. By its comedy stats. I still could understand the movie plot and details pretty well. Jojo Rabbit is like this but in a powerful way. It's enjoyable fun flick focusing with hard drama topics. This is tasteful film for everyone to try out.
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,6/10,"If you are from NZ, you'd know this type of film pretty well. It's period acting/tone is very loose, modern. It's comedy is primarily goofy. But it shifts between that and some fairly overt messaging that is safe, politically correct and otherwise fairly bland. It lands it's drama well enough, but it's somehow immature, one dimensional at the same time.It's extremely typical of NZ films to pitch between comedy and drama, although they tend to be at times darker than Aussie films.One could throw a dart at a board of Kiwi films, and 50/50 you'd hit something quite like this, outside of the bigger name actors and production value, it's quite missable. Honestly this film got a great deal of praise - I saw it, and I was just like, oh, it's another one of those - you film critics been asleep?"
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,6/10,"SYNOPSIS:
Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a young aspiring Nazi who's imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) and discovers that his mother is hiding a Jew in their home.REVIEW:
Taika Waititi does a wonderful job both as director and as Hitler. This film does a beautiful job with satire and approaching the topic in a way that's not going too far and has a lot of heart.
POSITIVES:
Taika Waititi is plain and simply a genius. Creates a warm atmosphere off a very cold subject. Making it very funny whilst not making the subject a joke. Very clever writing and he also makes it more so clowning on Hitler and nazi's rather than glorifying it. He may be the only person able to make a film like this. You had marvelous acting from Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie, but the absolute scene snatcher is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. I thought the Supporting Actress category was very stacked and I honestly was hoping for Scar Jo to take home the nom as she also had a phenomenal main role in Marriage Story. Between Scar Jo and Florence Pugh I was really riding for (even though I knew Laura Dern had it in the bag and also had a great performance). You then had Sam Rockwell, Stephen Merchant, Rebel Wilson and Alfie Allen all having wonderful supporting roles to complete a well selected cast.
NEGATIVES:
I'm going to get so much hate for this, but honestly I didn't think Archie Yates was great like everyone else thought. I thought his character has the potential to be very funny, but ultimately some of the delivery fell flat for me. Now, I'm not saying his performance was atrocious or irredeemable, I just didn't find it all that great. He's a child actor and has potential, just didn't work here for me. There was a very serious action that took place in the third act of the film that I felt was brushed over quite quickly. This wasn't something to just brush off. I really felt they should've took more time with what happened to let the audience really feel the impact.
CONCLUSION:
This film has a lot to offer whether it's laughs or smiles or tears and it's directed and written in such a way that allows you to do that without consciously thinking about if it's okay to do with the subject matter. There's a lot of heart in this film and the back and forth between Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie was beautiful. Unfortunately, I felt some bug points in the film were brushed over and I wasn't all in on all of the delivery. Still a great film that anyone could enjoy. 6.9/10."
JOJO RABBIT,18 June 2021,7/10,"There are comedies and satires that push boundaries, and movies that draw controversy for their depiction of serious issues. Jojo Rabbit manages to be just that in an era of increasing sensitivity. The movie follows Jojo, a 10-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany and is obsessed with becoming a Nazi soldier as he learns to question the ideology after he meets a Jewish girl his mother has been hiding. If there is one thing this movie had to get right, it's that Jojo's development needs to be convincing. It works. His change in character feels legitimate and earned, and his transition is fully convincing. The relationships he builds with Elsa, the Jewish girl, and his own mother are beautifully handled, and are among the films' highlights.The depiction of the Nazis as flamboyant buffoons was controversial for supposedly downplaying the atrocities they committed. This criticism ignores the nature of satire itself. The Nazis are the butt of the joke, not the people who died as a result of their actions. If it were the other way around, it would be a problem. That being said, this movie does have some very funny moments in it, and several that only work given the specific context they occur in. A nice detail is how bright the world is, as it shows how Jojo perceives the world of Nazi Germany, as a bright, cheerful place to live.While a lot of the criticism this movie has gotten is unwarranted or poorly thought out, but some of it isn't. It can shift between its serious moments and moments of levity too quickly, and the result is jarring. The light and serious moments work well individually, but the transitions between the two are important. And as far as effective satires go, there are those that make a much clearer and stronger case than this. This isn't exactly internet edgelord territory, but it's quite far from The Great Dictator or even The Producers. There are a few moments where the lack of conciseness makes it hard to tell whose side we're supposed to sympathize with. That, and the ending is kind of questionable.Perhaps the aspect of the movie that has drawn the most attention is Taika Waititi's depiction of Jojo's imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. Here, the infamous dictator, one of the most evil people to ever live, is over the top, vaguely friendly to Jojo, and even a father figure of sorts, the polar opposite of the man that we know from history. And despite this, it works. The reason why Taika's flamboyant portrayal of Hitler works is because he is not literally Adolf Hitler. He is Jojo's perception of Hitler, of who Hitler is. This also allows us to see Jojo's perspective and character development better. Having grown up in the system surrounded by propaganda, Jojo has come to view Hitler as a close companion and someone to aspire to, which leads to the perception we see here. It also helps his character development, as he personifies the Nazi ideology, meaning that Jojo's disputes with him show how he develops as a character.If you like this movie, then The Death of Stalin makes a good counterpart to this. It has a very different style of humor (and is more biting, in my opinion), but there's enough common ground with this to make it recommendable."
JOJO RABBIT,10 April 2020,9/10,"Great movie. Enthralling. Inspiring. The ""The Death of Stalin"" of Nazi Germany."
JOJO RABBIT,29 February 2020,8/10,"One of the funniest lines in a movie chock full of them! I love Whatiti's work: between this and What We Do In the shadows (t.v. and film) he's quickly become one of my favorite directors who's work I can view multiple times. The 2 children actors r absolutely adorable (jojo being heartbroken because his grandfather wasn't blond) and that Yorki kid had some of the best lines... I was surprised at the low metascore with low scoring critics saying this didn't go far enough to show how bad Nazis were. I thought it did what was necessary: we all know how deplorable they were (sadly still are). The last 30-20 minutes were striking, my heart sank when I saw Rosie's hanging feet.
All in all the cast was great, even rebel Wilson who I sometimes find grating, was used perfectly; her scene at the pool was hilarious! Keep up the good work Whatiti!!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,6/10,"If you're going to do a comedy with Hitler and Nazis in it, at least make it funny - like Mel Brooks' The Producers.There's enough of a potentially good farce here with Jojo as the Nazi Youth who's mother, Scarlett Johansson, who is sheltering a Jewish friend (Thomasin McKenzie) of her deceased daughter. Jojo goes about his daily routine of dressing up in uniform and keeping a diary of hateful propaganda he's digested, going to Nazi boy camp with his best mate - Archie Yates, who is far funnier - to be schooled by Sam Rockwell, as a reckless master who's all but lost the will to live, and Rebel Wilson, as an instructor all too willing to die for what she believes in.These are all fine, but it's Taika Waititi's Hitler who stands out as an annoying and redundant pest: he steals the scenes he's in by being boring and juvenile, slowing the pace down so he can gurn his way through whatever attention he can grab. Why is he in it at all if he does nothing to advance the story? It all seems a bit too much of an over-extended and unnecessary cameo by a director who's lost the run of himself after some delightfully human stories and finely weighted cameos.It's shot in that sub-Wes Anderson way, bright pastels and saturated primaries, but with none of the compositional precision, intricate dialogue and editing, nor any second viewing wit.Obviously, from the trailer, no one is expecting to watch a childhood war film along the lines of 'Come and See', but this isn't anywhere near as funny or controversial as it would like to think it is and for the most part simply fails to deliver on its potential to be either.A pity."
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,9/10,"A satire in the truest form, Jojo Rabbit took a moment to get its tonal footing, but when it did: wow, it's a rollercoaster of sadness and humor that hits all the classic movie beats. I think this film and its anti-hate message has the chance to age really well, and definitely one I can see enjoying immensely on repeat viewings. Taika Waititi has cemented himself as a major filmmaker with this effort. Portraying ""imaginary friend Hitler"" himself--a bit that could've really ran itself into the ground if it wasn't deployed with such masterful restraint--Waititi deserves extra commendation for having directed such a great film while, you know, dressed like that. Predictably great performances abound from the two A-listers (+ a brief, but highly entertaining one-scene cameo by the great Stephen Merchant), but it's really the A+ acting of the young leads Roman Griffin Davis in the titular role and Thomasin McKenzie who tie it all together. I highly recommend it in spite of the German accents.Also, one more thing that I debated even addressing with this review: I didn't realize how extremely polarizing this film was in the critical realm. The negative reviews are harsh as hell and all seem, to me at least, to miss the point entirely by focusing on the outlandish stereotype tropes, etc. I somewhat get the idea it is too fluffy given the underlying subject matter, but that feels like such an obvious choice; how can you slam it like it's the byproduct of neglect or laziness or whatever? I don't necessarily think it's a full-on classic but, A) I really liked it, and B) I do feel like history will be kind to it, even if (ironically?) its lack of regard for history seems to be the biggest collective knock against it right now."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,8/10,"The opening scene had me cringing, and I thought I was going to really dislike this film. The jokes seemed to miss the mark but then I warmed to the characters. Then the kicker, it got me, goddamit it really got me and I realised that I cared for these characters. There must have been some dust floating around the cinema as my eyes were watering!JoJo Rabbit is a brave film, I don't think any European could have made this. Not in today's culture. I glanced at the critics scores and noted them being around the 50% mark but the audience scores are much higher. One can conclude from this that there is a strict hegemony that critics, if they value their jobs cannot rebel against. But audiences, like those who valued Joker so highly, crave films which push against the Hollywood mafia."
JOJO RABBIT,10 December 2020,9/10,"It made me laugh by tickling my neurons with clever satire and jokes. Since I know some German (and I was even made Dummkopf several times) that Dummkopf moment made me laugh really loud while having a ''that's-brilliant'' moment. But even without understanding German - which would help you notice some subtleties - you will enjoy this no less. I had tears in my eyes at a certain scene and the drama was perfectly placed so the movie won't bombard you with everything funny and then rapidly lose its effect, like some other movies did.Unhappily, as a young adult who has been single for a while and has almost forgotten how being kissed feels like, the feminine beauty of the actress who plays Elsa, some dialogue lines and the final dance made me have that peculiar sentiment, that mix between melancholia, nostalgia, loneliness and dreamlike happiness. A sentiment that I loathe. But I can't blame the movie for that. You should watch it.A 9,5 out of 10 from me."
JOJO RABBIT,28 November 2019,4/10,"That perfectly describes the last 5 to 10 minutes of Jojo Rabbit-- up to and including its distasteful climax, which ruined what could've still been a good film. I say good, because I had a number of other issues with the movie.It wasn't funny. It was a toothless satire. An ineffective critique of the Nazi's.The heart of the film, and what saved it from being a complete disaster where the touching performances of Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl, and Scarlett Johansson as the mother of Roman Griffin Davis' title character Jojo. They were beautifully written and performed roles.Taika Waititi did a good job shooting the film, as its lovely looking, and made for an amusing Hitler for the first 30 minutes, after which the novelty wore off and he was annoying. I also thought Rebel Wilson and Sam Rockwell had a few amusing comic moments. Overall, the film was at its best when Hitler wasn't on-screen and it wasn't trying so hard to be funny and ""satirical."" The drama was the real highlight. Too bad it ended up failing failing on that front.
(SPOILERS)
Jojo Rabbit could have had an ending that pulled the heart strings and sent an important message about facing the consequences of your actions and learning from your mistakes. Instead we got a triumph of the human spirit dance-off between a Hitler youth who hadn't yet lived down his mistakes and the Jewish girl who he lied to and held captive just because he felt some butterflies in his stomach and/or missed his mommy. Barf.
(MORE-SPOILERS)
Look: Elsa slapped him. Which was good!!! Because He deserved it. She should have left him too: A sad goodbye. Elsa's finally free. Jojo is again left alone and hurt, left to reflect on another valuable lesson. Does he learn and grow from his mistakes? The End.How hard is that?No human being would have ever just let the atrocities Elsa experienced roll off them like water off a ducks back. Again, there's some really good craft in this movie but it's torpedoed by some tone-deaf creative choices from its director."
JOJO RABBIT,14 July 2020,8/10,"Really liked it, the emotional core of the film is very touching and the relationships between the characters work really well, the satire of nazi Germany as seen through the eyes of a child was very funny to me and his gradual disillusionment was believable."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,7/10,"The Stream: The whipsaw changes in tone can be disorienting and highlight lulls in the forward momentum of the story.The Big Screen: Compelling performances from a good cast bring offbeat humor and depth of emotion.The Final Bill: It is humorous with a distinct point of view and a heartfelt message, but if you're not on the wavelength with that point of view, you won't get it.-Trip FontaineHow do you solve a problem like Jojo? He's a 10 year-old, Hitler Youth with Adolf as an imaginary friend. Does he understand what it all means? Or, does he really just want to play dress up and be a part of a club, as is suggested by one of the other characters. How does a 10 year old navigate this complicated and dangerous world? Jojo Rabbit explores these themes and more through a delicate balance of satire and drama. Taika Waititi wrote and directed Jojo Rabbit, which is based on a novel by Christine Leunens called Caging Skies; and he brings his special brand of boffo comedy - even portraying Jojo's imaginary confidante, Adolf. It's both wacky and serious. Sometimes it is both within the span of minutes.I have had a difficult time digesting Jojo Rabbit because I wanted it to be more impactful to me than I felt it was. It's a coming of age story with many of the tropes that a coming of age story has. Jojo is destined to learn a lesson. On the other hand, Waititi, as writer, director and cast member, has a strong point of view about lampooning the ridiculousness of Nazism and through his brand of humor dismantles other hate-filled ideologies. In that way, the film is novel and a worthy viewing. The whole thing can be disorienting, which may take some audience members out of the overall experience of the film.Roman Griffin Davis plays Jojo. This kid is great. He has the weight of this sometimes silly and sometimes very serious movie on his shoulders. Through the eyes of this child, we see and question war, ideology, love and loss. Davis always seems appropriately in tune with his character. There are other great performances by Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother and Thomasin McKenzie as the mysterious stranger Jojo develops a relationship with. I'll say that Waititi's Adolf is very impactful in his brief scenes; and there's a hilarious and threatening cameo by Stephen Merchant. The only out of place and unnecessary cast member is Rebel Wilson, which is true of most of the roles she's portrayed. No offense to you, Ms. Wilson.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie that should be seen. It will not be what you expect. The balance of comedy and drama achieved by Waititi didn't always work to me. If you are not calibrated to this satirical tone, then you may not enjoy Jojo's ride. I say proceed to the theater with caution."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"In the dying days of the Nazi Third Reich Taiki Waititi creates a film that lets us laugh at the comic Nazis, but throws in moments of peril. They might be goons during this springtime in Germany, but they still have guns.Young Roman Griffin Davis's 10 year old JoJo is best friends with Taika Waititi's imaginary Hitler, and we meet the Führer encouraging timid JoJo to attend the local Hitler Youth Camp, with his 'second best friend' Yorki, played by Archie Yates. Both outsiders and happily so, running like demented leprechauns in the woods with the wacky Adolf.The camp is designed for boys to learn to hunt, shoot and kill for Hitler, while the girls learn domestic science and how to be good Aryan mothers. Much to their disappointment! Rebel Wilson is hilarious as Fraulein Rahm. 18 babies for Hitler and counting. And Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf is comically brilliant, wounded earlier on the front line he now trains the Hitler Youth. With assistance from his Sergeant Finkel, played by Alfie Allen. A good German couple best keeping quiet. And our own good little German, so full of his hero worship and desire to serve Adolf, but cannot quite bring himself to kill a poor little rabbit. Hence the unfortunate nickname he picks up, as well as a hand grenade. This daring and (funny) action that nearly kills him, may just have saved his life.Having Hitler as an imaginary friend is a pretty extreme affliction, but Taiki Waititi's Hitler does, among the Heil Hitlering, offer JoJo moments of support when he needs it most. Encouraged him to go to camp and JoJo Rabbit will be as welcome in the Third Reich as a lion. All helping the lonely boy.Back home and off school recovering, the scarred and limping JoJo, no longer able to fulfil his dream to become one of Hitler's bodyguards, and still unable to tie his shoelaces, is taken by his mother Rosie to the local army office. Played by Scarlett Johansson, Rosie insists, in no uncertain terms, that Captain Klenzendorf include and make use of JoJo. And makes Klenzendorf, having been demoted there after the grenade incident, feel her and JoJo's pain!While JoJo continues learning how to be a good Nazi with Hitler. Jews are bad, of course they are in Nazi Germany. But how do you know if you have met one? And what would you do if you did? For the small German town is a colourful and happy place for JoJo growing up, with no Jewish monsters lurking anywhere. And Rosie looking after her confused son, and washing down the craziness of her life with a bottle of red. Scarlett Johansson on top form.But there are more ways to be a good German in Nazi Germany. Although many of them will get you hung in the town square. What did they do? JoJo asks Rosie. Whatever they could! And when JoJo finds 'ghost' Thomasin McKenzie in the attic eaves of his dead sister's room, he has a crisis of his Nazi faith. If he reports her, young Elsa warns him, it won't be just her who will be taken away, so will his beloved mother who has hidden her. So they agree to keep secret that JoJo knows about Elsa in the attic. While Rosie tells Elsa in their secret night meetings that JoJo is such a committed Nazi they cannot let him know. So begins the comedy of errors as JoJo and Elsa meet secretly every day for her to tell him all about being a Jew. Things like how she hangs upside down like a bat and will have horns when she's older. And she can read minds too. Although not German minds of course, they are too stupid! All details for the book JoJo is writing for Hitler. And perhaps moments of comedy and joy for the fragile Elsa, who has the heart of a lion, but whose very existence is dependent on this strange little 10 year old. And Elsa is a good influence on JoJo, with Adolf losing his grip on the love struck boy. And not happy about it. But Jewish Elsa may not be the monster after all, not when the Russians coming from the East allegedly eat people! Pick your villains wisely JoJo.And while JoJo collects the town pots and pans as 'scrap' metal for Germany, Yorki is conscripted to the army and dressed in his new paper like uniform; cardboard! We know that the Reich is nearly done, sending prepubescent boys to fight. What a hoot Archie Yates is though, soon to be seen in the Home Alone reboot, and could have almost won the war singlehandedly for the Allies. But when Stephen Merchant and his Gestapo goons visit the house, the Heil Hitler comedy suddenly gets serious. With Klenzendorf and Fingel also turning up unexpectedly. One would almost think something was up. And as the house is searched, Elsa is found.It seems far enough away from the horrors of WWII to be able to laugh, but at the time there was nothing funny about Elsa's experience. Yet Taiki has reimagined the horrors through the innocent eyes of a 10 year old, and cleverly turned them into laugh out loud comedy. After recounting his 'imaginary' interrogations of Elsa, Klenxendorf finds JoJo's ludicrous descriptions of Jewish people hilarious. And the sight of Klenxendorf and Finkel racing into battle with their trademarked uniforms, against the newly arrived Americans and Russians, was a camp sight to behold.With a terrific cast of children the film had tremendous heart, and our hope that JoJo will do the right thing plays until the end. The vulnerable Elsa totally dependent on his decisions. We want him to be a good German just like Rosie. And he definitely needs a good slap. (Of course this was a different time!). But eventually there is hope."
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2021,6/10,"I became a huge fan of Taiki Waititi after seeing What We Do in the Shadows. I was very much looking forward to this film. I understood that the subject matter was more serious and it was likely to have much more depth. However, it disappointed me on both counts. It wasn't very entertaining or amusing, and neither did I find it particularly poignant in its message . It kind of felt like it cheaply took a subject matter which is easy to make emotionally stimulating and affecting, but didn't even make the most of that. The two youngsters did a fantastic job to carry the film that is for certain."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,10/10,"I heard someone say not to watch trailers about Jojo Rabbit. And I agree with that. Because the trailers do not... CANNOT... do it justice. And no matter what anyone says about it; ; no matter how they try to explain the story or convey how good it is... they're also not doing it justice. Even Taika Waititi couldn't explain what his own film accomplishes. Satire... comedy... none of those words are sufficient. It's something you have to see for yourself, and better with fellow film goers. So just go see it..... go on.... time's a'wastin.... why are you still sitting there?"
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,9/10,"Jojo rabbit is a post war satire about the Nazis, WWII and all those stuff, but presented in a comedic way. We follow Jojo, a boy who is a fanatical nazi and hates jews. One day, he finds a jew girl in his attic. How he deals with the situation, will he follow his fanatical way or will he show humanity. That's the plot summed up.Now, the theme is pretty interesting. I've seen a lot of movies based on nazis like the inglorious basterds, Schindler's list, Downfall, etc..but this is probably the first family nazi movie..lol. It'll make you laugh in the first half and cry in the second. It's full of emotions. We also get to see the nazi perspective and their hatred. A must watch."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,9/10,"Simple and honest. If you found this anything but than we need to talk.Great script doesn't hurt and acting even moreso. When I see the PG-13 attached to any film and I get a rash, but this one, doesn't just remove the meh stigma associated with MPAA's dreaded rating system, it walks all over it with a brilliant film. This is one that skirts the edges of brilliant historical satire and a nu-Wes Anderson classic, so if that means anything to you---get onboard. I hope this film gets the accolades it deserves."
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,9/10,"This is the first movie I have seen in 2020 and hence this new decade. It is a shame this is the film with that honour because I fear the next ten years of viewing will not match this, such a high bar it has set.
I laughed, I cried and I got angry. This is like a catch-22/Mash type film, just when you've had a big laugh it whips the rug from under your feet with something so sad or ugly - it is perfectly and beautifully done.
The acting is top class, hard to believe the young chap playing Jojo is in his first film so excellent he is.
There are people who say this is tasteless but I am afraid they simply do not get it and/or their grasp of the history of the time is poor and so they do not get the swipes and references.
This movie also looks great both when it is whimsical and also when grim and sober.
I just loved it, I think I will be watching it many times over the coming years.
Well done all involved, it must get at least a nod at an oscar if not win outright."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,9/10,"I knew I was going to love Jojo Rabbit when I saw the trailer and read about the premise, and I was even more certain when I realised it was directed by Taika Waititi. How long does he have to wait for some Oscars or something? The man is a borderline genius.
I suppose some people will never accept that Nazism and the Holocaust can ever be used to get laughs, but what this film does so well is ridicule their hateful ideology and show it up for the absurdity that it was. That must go in no small measure to the book upon which the film is based, but it still had to be adapted, and in fine style too. The horrors of the latter days of WWII are portrayed unflinchingly, and in those moments of course the humour gives way to pathos. The way in which these two elements of the film are balanced is particularly clever; at no point did I feel like my emotions were being cynically manipulated for kudos.
The acting in Jojo Rabbit is superb. Scarlett Johansson thoroughly deserves her Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Jojo's struggling mother, determined to remain independent and hopeful of an end to the war, despite Nazism and her own son's insistence on being a staunch Hitler Youth. The child actors are also very good (although I'm not sure the Jewish girl Elsa could be said to be played by a child actor, since Thomasin McKenzie is 19), and the supporting cast do good work with their various and peculiar characters - the jolly yet creepy Gestapo man (Stephen Merchant), the cavalier but comradely commander of the local Hitler Youth (Sam Rockwell) and his limp sidekick (Alfie Allen), and of course the significant presence of Waititi himself as Jojo's imaginary friend Adolf Hitler! He did a great job of portraying Hitler as Jojo imagined him to be, and I liked the way the Hitler persona changes as Jojo grows up a bit and becomes acquainted with harsh reality.
The one character which I didn't relate to and couldn't see the point of was Rebel Wilson's Nazi instructor with the Hitler Youth. I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson, but I don't think it was her spoiling the role, just that the character was superfluous.
In pretty much every other respect I thought Jojo Rabbit was beautifully satirical and poignant in equal measure, and I urge everyone to see it!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,4/10,"I dont like making light of war, especially half serious half comedic takes. lameee"
JOJO RABBIT,12 April 2020,6/10,"This movie at times feels like its for kids almost with its child like humor. But other times you can tell it's very much for adults. The childlike elements of it I think are what have me disliking some of it. The first hour especially. Thankfully the last hour really is where things finally get good and enjoyable. There ends up being more emotions that just sillness and child like stuff.I read alot of the reviews where they said it makes light of WW2, but while there are some ""silly"" parts, if you listen you can see the whole thing makes fun of the nazis. Such as when one man remarks about about a boy and how he can use a knife but not a grenade, but the mom in a serious (but sarcastic way for the viewer) that its ok if her underage son goes to a useless war and if he uses a gun. Thus mocking how crazy the nazis were.I don't want to say this a ""deep thought"" kind of movie, but you really need to pay attention to everything to catch just how much the nazis are mocked. On the other side of things when it comes to any death, it does not make it funny. It still shows the horror (well of screen) of what went on. I think they did a good job on towing the line between tasteful and distasteful.This all said its worth a watch if you have nothing else to do really. If you make it past the first hour without being bored, the last half makes it worth it. I should note the director, the actors...etc are all jewish in real life. They all had family involved in the holocaust. I'm not saying if your jewish and ok with this movie that the movie is ok to do, but I am saying I doubt anyone who is jewish would do a movie that they felt was distasteful about what happened."
JOJO RABBIT,19 November 2020,8/10,"Its best to go into this movie expecting a light satire. The story is a short period of time seen through the eyes of a 10 year old living in a German Town at the later stages of WWII. He's brainwashed and excited to be a Hitler youth member complete with an imaginery friend who is Hitler or his warped version of him.
While the movie is never laugh out loud its amusing but then can change very quickly to a tragedy.
Jo Jo is entertaining, its extremely well acted and the sets and production are extremely absorbing.
It won't be for everyone, its not Schindlers List or Pianist it never gets that graphic but it will play with your emotions enough for you appreciate what is going on here. It can be quite haunting without being in your face mainly due to the actors being on top form with an excellent script.
Its an excellent movie but not for everyone."
JOJO RABBIT,28 November 2020,9/10,"Ohh.. this is a very good movie!
All the story and the acting was very nice!"
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,6/10,"The tone of the movie is uneven: The first act is a satire; the second act is more of a coming of age comedy; and the third act is a straight-up war drama. But overall, it's a entertaining comedy. 7/10."
JOJO RABBIT,2 April 2020,9/10,"This movie is absolutely hilarious and utterly charming. Davis as JoJo is perfect. Waititi as his doofus imaginary Hitler friend is so dang funny. Scarlett Johansson does the best acting of her career. This movie takes something awful and turns it into an entertaining and engaging metaphor, executed perfectly with flawless acting and a great script."
JOJO RABBIT,5 November 2020,10/10,"The movie for me was very touching. It showed the point of view of the war from people on the other side. How did it felt, how clueless they were about winning (some 15 year old soldiers are so happy to be sent to the frontlines). How the children who were born in a society already totalitarian reacted (they were too young to remember their lives before the war). And in the end, we have 2 main character, Jojo and Elsa, who have so , many reasons to distrust each other, but in the end their shared pain and losses due to the war actually creates a bond. The soundtrack with Beatles and David Bowie singing in German made the film more special."
JOJO RABBIT,9 May 2020,9/10,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. The description doesn't do it justice, there are real gems of dialogue woven throughout that highlight the films underlying meaning. The acting is superb, the directing is brilliant. The coloristic And creative choices are bold And work to make the story unique from any other war film. Keep an open mind, try it, you might enjoy the journey more than you think."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,10/10,"# extremely witty idea and highly successful execution# acting giants including 12-year old Roman# Scarlett hotter than lava and when she pretends to be the dad scary in every way
her acting range is unlimited# Prague looks gorgeous# Relevant to current bigotry worldwide [Royinga/Palestine/Islamophobia etc etc]# That is some imaginary friend# will want to see again maybe even thrice; this happens to me seldom# this blot on the collective human consciousness can only be removed by humour and yes mockery see The Death of Stalin 2017 for the same reason"
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a very well made movie with incredible performances from Scarlett Johansson and Roman Griffin Davis. It also have great cinematography and an enthralling story. The biggest criticism that people have with this movie is its tone, and while I agree that the movie can be annoyingly quirky at times, it's also emotional and heartfelt. Overall, this is a great movie."
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,8/10,"An entertaining and comedic take on the absurdity of war and in particular the end of the second World War. I can imagine, in today's environment, how a lot of people felt watching Hitler make jokes but I thought that and other things that I'd guess people took offense to were in-line with the message of the film. The world needs more films that are willing to take risks."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,1/10,"The worst movies are Americans speaking English with a German accent trying to play Germans speaking German, and trying to be funny at the same time. This movie could have been so much better if played by genuine Germans. It's like the series vikings where every viking somehow speaks perfect English. Maybe this movie is fantastic for those people living in the US, UK and Australia, but personally I think it's just rubbish marketed as something great by critics who don't understand real cinematography. Sorry, it's another 1/10 from me."
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,8/10,"Set against the backdrop of WWII, ten-year-old Johannes Betzler (Davis) navigates his way through Nazi Germany accompanied by his imaginary friend Hitler (Waititi), albeit a more goofy, childish incarnation of the notorious tyrant. Aspiring to become one of Hitler's most trusted Nazi's, Johannes commences his first day at a Hitler Youth training camp with giddy optimism. Johannes is certain of his path towards becoming a full-fledged Nazi, until he learns his mother, Rosie (Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl upstairs. Rosie's reservations and disapproval towards the war are a well-kept secret, confined within the walls of the Betzler household. Johannes is immediately suspicious of Elsa Korr (McKenzie), but rather than immediately turn her into the Gestapo, he chooses to learn about the people he's been indoctrinated into believing are the enemy. Given the subject matter it selects to satirise, Jojo Rabbit may have been a recipe for disaster in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. Fortunately, Waititi works wonders with the source material (Caging Skies by Christine Leunens) and produces a film that is both hilarious and tragic.Waititi employs a brilliant line up for Jojo Rabbit. Davis and McKenzie are terrific as an aspiring Nazi/on the run Jew duo who's worlds are forced to collide in the midst of war, and Waititi's hilarious interpretation of the tyrannical leader is a performance very few could accomplish. Johansson's portrayal as a desperate single-mother operating in a society she's secretly opposed to whilst striving to do the right thing results in one of the more nuanced performances of her career, and Stephen Merchant's cameo as a Gestapo agent fuses both light humour with towering intimidation during one of the films tenser scenes. A fundamental strength of Waititi's screenplay is how it accomplishes the balance between comedy and tragedy. Jojo Rabbit has moments of gleeful silliness accompanied with clever, off-beat dialogue, but Waititi masterfully incorpates several gut punch moments that certainly hit hard during the films more sombre moments. For a Nazi-satire flick, it's surprisingly heartfelt. Perhaps most importantly, it never undermines the severe casualties brought about during Hitler's vile dictatorship. Waititi knows when to poke fun and when to tackle the material seriously. Jojo Rabbit is another great film from the New Zealand filmmaker and is absolutely worth watching; it's quirky, sincere and at times, strikingly real."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,6/10,"I am really struggling to understand just where director/writer Taika Waititi was going with this movie. It is obviously anti-hate, anti-racism--duh, but its bursty pace makes any idea it might try to present lost up in the air. He got the people, he supposedly got the vision and know, he has kinda executed it.The movie takes place in the final days of World War II--the point where the German people have realized the insanity of Hitler's ridiculous delusions of grandeur. They know their end is approaching but they also know the realization they came to, they came to it too late. Few men are still carrying the indoctrination in their head. Among them, 9-year old boy Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), whose grasp on politics is, obviously, benign. His ""hatred"" towards Jews is summed up in fantastical elements, the regime infecting the young kids' minds by telling them stuff like the Jews have horns and the Devil controls their minds. Kids fell easy to fascination, but it got me thinking, in 1939, an entire nation did too. So, of course, when Jojo finds out his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) inside their home, he gets jumpy.Elsa sees him for the innocent and corrupted-minded boy he is and, eventually, the two grow to be friends--no spoiler alert, come on, it's obvious! The idea of unity here is well-defined but Waititi resolves to some annoying shticks to get it done. For instance, he plays Adolf Hitler--not the actual Adolf Hitler but Jojo's choice for an imaginary friend. He often appears to Jojo and acts in a boyish manner. The surreal representation is cool at first but as it goes on, it starts to become pointless and its shtick wears thin. Happily, it's over before it becomes cringeworthy and is, nonetheless, an interesting exercise in screenwriting.More heartwarming supporting characters arise in the form of Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) tasked with preparing the city for imminent invasion. He looks like he fights a losing fight and he knows it, but he keeps his chin up. The ending is fitting and expected, even if it doesn't define much which hasn't already been defined in this movie. To me, the only explanation to the weird pace and dreamy representation of the ending battle is that Waititi shows this movie through the eyes of children--unable to fully grasp and comprehend its entirety so neither do we, watching."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,10/10,"I have now seen the movie twice. I watched it solo on friday and again today with my husband. I loved it the first time but even more so the second time, I was able to capture more of the brilliant dialogue and nuances. This made me laugh(which is amazing based on the subject matter, it made me feel sick and it made me cry and rejoice for the goodness of human kind all in the space of 1 hour and 45 min.The acting by Mckenzie was INCREDIBLE and by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time. She was able to be strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was incredibly authentic.I think my main take from the movie is summed up in one of the best lines, when Rosie and Jojo are looking at the recently hanged people in the street he asks her ""what did they do?"" and she replies ""what they could"". So much power in this, and he later states it to himself when the war ends. We all can do a little to end hate, to be our best selves, to improve the world around us and dance because we are free.Highly suggest watching this. I recognize its a hard topic to have comedy and satire, but recognizing the director is of Jewish heritage helps this sentiment a lot. I also am a Jew and found this to be a great take and shows how tragic it ways and horrendous through a new lens."
JOJO RABBIT,20 April 2021,9/10,"I found this hidden gem one night and so glad I did. I went into this movie not knowing anything about it. It started out kind of weird and I was tempted to turn it off, but so glad I kept watching. It's heartwarming, funny, and sad. Great acting. Great storyline. When it was over, it stayed with me for sure and I thought about all the touching moments for days. Don't hesitate...just watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2020,3/10,Glad I did not pay to watch this at a theatre. On par with the Ballad Of Buster Scruggs. Can't get those 45 mins back.
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,10/10,"Masterfully crafted. Mr. Waititi delivers an amazing film filled with dark humor.Davis is fantastic, the whole movie, actually, is his show. Chapeau.McKenzie delivers an amazing performance.Scarlett really does deserved the nomination and I wouldn't be surprised if she won."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,10/10,"Jojo rabbit probably has one of the most amazing scenes in film history and if you watched it you know what it is. Acting on all accounts is great and scar Jo deserves every nomination she's getting, roman is a fabulous actor and I feel this will not be the last we see of him. The jokes are really funny and it is an anti hate satire so don't get offended by it because it portrays nazis as idiots and one gag is about two of them being gay which was played for gags which Hollywood shod move past but they make them all so stupid and rebel wilson does great work portraying her character in such a way. Jojo rabbit is a masterpiece 10/10"
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,8/10,"I liked all of the characters and that made me care what happened to them. The last several movies that I've seen hasn't come close to accomplishing that.See this if you want to see a goofy, quirky movie with a heart."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"It's the latter stages of the war but despite this, the Reich continues to present itself as winning and the spell that Adolf Hitler has over the German people is still strong. JoJo is a ten year old boy who, like many children, see the world in a very simple fashion. Hitler is good and Jews are bad. As a member of the Hitler youth he wants to be a good Nazi and has Adolf Hitler as an imaginary friend.
An accident at camp leaves him stuck at home where he discovers there is a Jewish girl hiding in his house. From this point on JoJo is forced to confront the grey areas of the world. Jews might not be evil monsters, how can his worldview be perfect if his Mother is hiding enemies of the state? How can he do his duty like a good Nazi if the consequences would likely be the arrest and execution of his mother?
Through this device, JoJo slowly uncovers the truth about the Nazi party and his childlike worldview moves from black and white to a more nuanced understanding.
If this sounds like heavy material it is, but this is also a very funny satire and Taika Waititi manages to dance the fine line between keeping this funny and touching, without making it depressing or treating the material without the necessary seriousness. Roman Griffin Davis is fantastic as JoJo, as is Thomasin Mackenzie as Elsa. Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell give wonderful performances and the rest of the cast, Stephen Merchant as a Gestapo agent, Alfie Allen as Captain Klenzendorf's Lieutenant, Rebel Wilson as a militant Nazi instructor and Archie Yates as JoJo' s friend Yorki. Taika Waititi does double duties as Director and as JoJo's imaginary Hitler who slowly transforms from supportive imaginary childlike friend to frenzied German Chancellor imaginary friend.
Brilliant, funny, touching, sad, hopeful and heartwarming."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,10/10,"Here's my review of JoJo Rabbit . So JoJo Rabbit is directed by Taika Waititi , the  genius with an Ace Ventura persona who gave us Thor frickin Ragnarok ! which was one of my favorite movies of 2017 and that made me look back at his old films and the one thing common among them is that they're really funny but with a lot of human connection . Taika's humour is a unique brand that only he can land and that's what makes this movie work so well. The movie stars this pre drug use McCauley Culkin lookalike kid who's just brilliant in this movie ! The story is set in Germany amidst world war 2 where JoJo , a wannabe boy scout and Hitler fanatic comes across a Jew girl in hiding and becomes skeptical over his priorities . Taika Waititi himself , like in all his movies plays an extended cameo of JoJo's imaginary version of Adlof Hitler and he was bloody brilliant as well , Scarlett Johannson plays JoJo's Mom and she's on a roll with this and last year's ' Marriage story ' some damn good acting right there. Other supporting characters which includes Sam Rockwell as Captain k was hilarious ! All other characters were written brilliantly and had the right screen space. The movie takes you in for a satire on war and turns into something much more amazing as it progresses. In the end JoJo Rabbit is heartwarming , heartbreaking , funny , and is pretty much home alone meets Diary of a wimpy kid set amidst world war 2."
JOJO RABBIT,27 October 2019,8/10,"""What did they do?"" Jojo asks his mother, inquiring about the townspeople he sees hanging in the village square.""Plenty of good,"" Jojo's mother responds, reinforcing the noblest of convictions to both herself and her impressionable young son.The above interaction is just one of many poignant scenes found throughout Taika Waititi's 'Jojo Rabbit,' about a young boy in Germany's army who discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.Beyond the many instances of poignancy and incisiveness, 'Jojo Rabbit' is equally packed with witty dialogue and humorous interludes, making it among the finest examples of satire to emerge from Hollywood in recent memory.So color us mystified as to why critics have given this gem such a paltry 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 58% on Metacritic. Those who panned the movie are either unable to laugh at absurdity, or they themselves are so absurd that it's not worth anyone's time to read their brainsick thoughts."
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2020,10/10,This movie was much better that I expected. It was a beautiful story!
JOJO RABBIT,18 April 2020,8/10,"I do n't know what to say except Taika.
Hilarious and sad
Hopelessness and radiance in unnecessary war. The roles of Scarlett and the instructor are fantastic. Tears burst in the second half."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,8/10,"Jo Jo Rabbit is very fun & sweet movie despite dealing with such a serious subject.The story is from Nazi Germany period where Hitler is ruling.The 10 year boy joins the youth training camp, and he has Hitler as an imaginary friend played by director Taika Waititi himself.He has nothing but hate for jews.
The film is a satire/parody of the Nazi Germany period.The film gives message of anti-hate.There are obvious flaws here & there.The Nazi Germany period isn't explored well, the Jew side isn't shown much except one character.But the film still turns out very well, and we get conclusion of War & Hate in the later part of the movie, and that is what the film aims for.
The child is the highlight of the film and we see everything from his prospective, he is sweet & likeable, Scarlett Johansson played his mom.She gave an amazing performance in the table scene, maybe that's why she was nominated for Oscar.The Jew girl was really good too.The final scene was very lovely"
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,10/10,"Beyond excellent. WWII and Nazi is such a tragic subject to deal with. Nevertheless, movie succeeded to make it warm, funny and very emotional. It is "" Life is beautiful"" kind of movie. Highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,7 September 2021,7/10,Just slightly missed the mark. Thought it could've been funnier or more sad. It kind of wavers in a weird muddle ground.
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,7/10,"Before watching JOJO rabbit, except for the trailer, I didn't have any presupposition about the film, I didn't know much about the director, and I didn't read the original novel caging skins. JOJO rabbit's clip rhythm is interesting, bright and terrifying. Director Taika waititi's JOJO's imaginary Hitler also adds a lot of laughs and highlights to the film. On the whole, it is a film reflecting on war from the perspective of children, with tears in laughter and tragedies in comedy"
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,"A refreshing piece of good cinema in the midst of all the superhero CGIfest. The acting is amazing, the premise is entertaining."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,3/10,"I cannot understand at all where the hype for this film is coming from. There is absolutely nothing in this film that has not been done better elsewhere. There is no reason for this film to exist, as far as I'm concerned. The style is seems to riff on Wes Anderson, to the point where he should probably be asking for a royalty. Except it comes across as a ""poor man's"" version of it.And there is a Disney war propaganda cartoon made in 1943 called ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" that captures the exact same essence of ""JoJo Rabbit"" - the absurdity of the Nazi beliefs and Hitler as the buffoon - and does a better job of it. Not many people nowadays have seen that old short, but ""JoJo Rabbit"" basically rips it off (particularly the ""Heil Hitler"" gags). I enjoyed that short cartoon far more then I enjoyed JoJo Rabbit and recommend you check it out.I could perhaps forgive the derivative nature of the film if it was actually clever or funny, but it is neither. The humour is all one-note low brow slapstick. And there is a confusing juxtaposition at play between absurd and completely unrealistic comedy while ALSO trying to insert entirely serious (and old as dirt) messages about war and fascism. The two work together like oil and water.I am coming to the conclusion that the only reason this film got so much attention from the Academy Awards was that it was this years ""woke"" choice - a film where the message trumps the filmmaking. Not recommended at all."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,7/10,"This kid is brilliant! His Acting, expressions, cluelessness.
The movie is ok. Fun way to deliver one tiny side of the nazzi oppression. Could have been better thou. Too much unnecessary scenes."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,3/10,"I like Taika Waititi's films, but this is an infantilzation of the holocaust on par with (trigger warning) Life is Beautiful. Like this other film, Jojo Rabbit turns the antisemitism and nazi fanaticism into a light Hollywood fairy tale with enough carefully manicured dark moments to imply that it has something deeper going on, when it really doesn't. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the story is tonally all over the place (missing is the effortless tension of comedy and tragedy present in Hunt for the Wilderpeople), and there are no insights here (we know nazis are bad, antisemitism is irrational). Jojo's transformation as presented here is facile and unbelievable, and the deliberate caricatures are too far removed from their real, historical counterparts to have any sting of the best of mercilessly dark satire.The movie could have mined the abject absurdity of nazi ideology for humor (The Great Dictator being a classic example along with The Producers), but it's jokes are easy and soft on the audience. They don't match the subject matter and the tension between their cuteness and the movie's darker aspirations never produces anything worthwhile - it doesn't really work for the most part. This is ultimately a kids movie, a stylized fairy tale, and though no one watches this expecting Come and See (1985), its sugary tone is overwhelming and is undone by its more serious pretensions. The movie ultimately cannot communicate, let alone grasp, the weight of the tragedy it chooses as its subject matter, which makes its humor empty rather than resonant."
JOJO RABBIT,11 April 2020,1/10,"Don't know who's paying for these reviews. I'm stuck at home due to Covid-19 but still prefer to do nothing than watch this snore fest. I've never seen something as stupid and ridiculous to the extent that it's not even funny if it was made for just comedy.To conclude, this movie is the only cure to Insomnia."
JOJO RABBIT,30 March 2021,8/10,"Funny, sensitive, sad satire, stylishly crafted by Waititi."
JOJO RABBIT,14 April 2020,9/10,"I really can't stand hitler stuff... but this is awesome.
A beautifully made, simply a wow! beautiful film."
JOJO RABBIT,12 August 2020,3/10,"Exceedingly disappointing. As WWII satires go, this only gets a 'meh'. Other recent satires made about the war and other 20th century atrocities have been done better. So much about this film is unwatchable for me. The film stock and the lighting is rough on the eyes. The acting is throwaway (though a decent enough cast, the actors didn't seem to have their hearts in their roles) and the whole thing just seems disjointed and all over the place. I cannot figure out or really understand the choice of music either. All in all, this movie is generously receiving a 3 from me."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,10/10,"Looking back at some of the films I've seen in the last few months. there have been good (1917), and the bad (Rise of Skywalker). Good but the script was a bit lame. Bad because for a multi billion dollar production with a vast history behind it, Skywalker had no soul or passion.Jojo Rabbit had everything. Starting with a script that hit every beat, actors that make you believe in the situation, and a story that never lost touch of tis theme that there is hope no matter what the situation. If you have certain films, such as Groundhog Day, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, Lord of the Rings, that you watch ever couple of years and still enjoy them even though you know whats going to happen, see this film and then add it to the list."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,9/10,"It's amazing what a good sense of humor can do. In the case of Jojo Rabbit humor is used to show the absolute ridiculousness of the Hitler Jugend, de-power the führer himself and tell us the incredibly brave story of resistance against the Nazi's within Germany itself.
The film isn't flawless because it doesn't spread the necessary information evenly, but when you're laughing out loud, asking 'did they really just go there?' or screaming 'no they didn't!', you'll forgive and forget any mistakes immediately. So far, so funny, but to top it all off it gives us a few brilliant moments where you are reminded of the subject matter we're really dealing with: the hell that came to Earth called World War II. And the power of a young boy his love for the people around him.
I loved it and so will you."
JOJO RABBIT,13 November 2020,10/10,Took a dark subject matter and made it hilarious while ridiculing nazi Germany.. delivered amazing performances all round... emotional shocks and a kicking soundtrack..just a perfect movie
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2019,10/10,"While the American movie world raved over the mediocre ""Joker,"" Taika Waititi's latest slipped quietly into limited distribution to a chorus of critical yawns. We've seen SO many stories like this before, Schindler's List, The Book Thief, The Nightingale, yadayadayada. Who is this Taika again? The one who directed Thor: Ragnarok? Whateva!Except that in case you've actually been paying attention to Waititi's career--I mean, to the superb series of pictures he's made in addition toThor Ragnarok and What We Do In The Shadows--Jojo Rabbit is a superlative addition to the growing oeuvre of arguably the finest living film director working in the English language. If you haven't seen Boy, Eagle vs. Shark, or Hunt for the Wilderpeople (not to mention the Oscar-nominated short Two Cars, One Night that Boy is based on) you may well watch Jojo Rabbit with the blase attitude of someone who can't enjoy the pleasure that only comes from recognizing and grooving on the unique point of view of a first-class auteur. I'll add that every great Jewish artist must at some point grapple with the Holocaust, and I'm happy that Taika got to do it sooner rather than later, especially when he was still young enough to play the role of Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler and thus give the two fingers up to that contemptible mass murderer who is still so shamefully revered in so many places around the world, particularly here in the U.S. Go Taika!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,10/10,Unbelievable cast. Taika Watiti is a genius! I so hope he gets an Oscar nod
JOJO RABBIT,18 October 2019,7/10,"Jojo has to enjoy the life every normal kid does. However, he needs to control the options. With the tales of war looming, such is not a good time to control options. Jojo is expected to sing the song of the day. Loyalty to the Fuhrer means everything. His word is upside down. Creativity in the script introduces a bright spot into Jojo's life. He followed this light. By the time he reaches it, he begun to know that loyalty without love is fire without flame. Waititi (T) directs like he acts. Wherever you have Wilson (R) you have fun. Jojo Rabbit is the motion for our emotions."
JOJO RABBIT,14 August 2020,10/10,"One of the best children movie with very good cast, background, cinematography, solid story, unique wardrobe, everything is perfect"
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is very interesting. It is a lot about the ethics of a person. It talks about why people do what they do, especially with social pressure to fit in. As the protagonist grows, you can see the change in him. He is struggling with his humanity. It also gives a good luck at the flip side of the war. Be Warned, there is historical racial slurs throughout the movie. At the same time, there is a scene where it shows the direct impact of racial slurs. It is an educational film.
As a comedy, it does have funny moments, some of the comic relief moments are uncomfortable and a little off color. This movie is more of a drama, it deals with the concepts of World War 2 in a mature manner. It is a coming of age film that shows the division of a family due to war conflicts."
JOJO RABBIT,30 March 2020,1/10,"I am totally baffled at all the high ratings for this ""movie"". It was one of those surreal acting movies where you can't take anything seriously, so when they tried to have serious scenes in it they didn't come across as real. It's just bizarre how they portrayed Hitler as some goofy hip dude from the 60's man(he literally uses the word man a lot). I thought with Fat Amy in the movie it would have some funny scenes with her but her lines were just dull and flat. And it didn't help that JS was just a goofy and air-headed mom dancing around. At the beginning of the movie she was a powerful Nazi leader then after that they just kind of forgot about that fact and then she was just a goofy mom that liked to ride bikes. What? And Hitler carried around cigarettes - it is a well known fact that Hitler was totally against cigarettes. I could go on an on but this was a total waste of time."
JOJO RABBIT,5 September 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit one of the best movies I've ever watched. You laugh you cheer and you cry. Directed by Taika watiti, Jojo rabbit is not a movie you easily forget. Specially the performance of the actors, the kid JoJo had the charisma and elsa was scary and lovable the way Taika wanted her and Adolf was great specially funny hitler is a thing you'd like to see. SAM rockwelll was great, short but epic scenes everytime he's on screen you expect to laugh or... Cry
AND of course The Great Scarlett, I've never seen Scarlett that energized. Cinematography is 10/10, the feet moment in the movie are scene to be taught for generations, one moment the feet dances and the other they freeze. EPIC PERFECT MOVIE by all aspects. Enjoy you won't see that greatness always."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,5/10,"I was really disappointed in this film and I honestly dont get all the 10/10 scores. The acting was good, but the dialogue was mind numbing to the point I almost fell asleep. I get what it was about but I didnt find it very funny or heartwarming or any of the other thing others thought of it. I really wanted to like it but ultimately, didnt."
JOJO RABBIT,28 April 2020,8/10,"This is a cute and funny little WWII movie about a young Nazi-boy who is forced to reconcile his beliefs when confronted with a rather high-stakes dilemma. The boy must choose between his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, and a young Jewish girl living in his mothers house. Through this ordeal, the young boy learns about love, loss, and strength from his mother, Jewish girl, and a Hitler Youth leader played by Sam Rockwell.All of the actors in this movie are enjoyable to watch. Roman Griffin Davis is excellent and adorable. The movie is absurd obviously but considering that, it's pretty well-made.Taika Waititi's work is somewhat hit or miss for me but whenever it's a hit, it's great. I'd highly recommend this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,5/10,"When you are young, with the propaganda that is fed to you, you grow up a simpleton. You think the knowledge that had been fed down your throat is the gospel truth and everything else is just farce. Then you grow up.You soon realise that it has all been a smokescreen. The victors and those with might had convinced their way is King.With the opening of the inner eye, the onus is on you to educate and to spread the word to the ignoramus. But then, no one is going take what you say lying down.I was surprised that Scarlett Johansson was actually nominated for the Oscars for her role in this movie. Her character is hardly memorable, and she dies before the end of the film.As for the storyline, it is nothing new. It is told from the viewpoint of a 10-year-old boy, Jojo, who is gung ho with joining Hitler's youth Army. Deep inside, he is a pacifist. He has an imaginary friend in the form of a comical Adolf Hitler who cajoles him to do the things that the Nazis want Germans to do. Jojo's mother, on the other hand, is a Jew sympathiser. Jojo soon discovers a Jewish girl that she hides in the attic.They soon build a bond. Jojo realises that Jews are no different from ordinary Germans; unlike what had been fed by the propaganda machinery.A potentially forgettable satire that nobody would remember in five years."
JOJO RABBIT,5 March 2020,7/10,"When having seen the trailer I did not expect what I eventually saw. From kids making nazi jokes, to actually really powerful and moving scenes. For me this was a really enjoyable film, I definitely recommend it."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,8/10,"This movie is just purely amazing!! I loved every single second of it and i must say that the acting, the plot and the cast were great! This movie was balanced out perfectly, making it funny but sad at some points also! I would recommend this movie to anyone!!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 August 2020,10/10,"I happened across this wonderful movie on cable while channel surfing. I suppose the appropriate genre label would be ""black comedy"", but I've never seen another black comedy like this one. Laughing and shedding tears, not from one minute to the next, but both at the same time. I don't need to tell anyone what it is about. All I want to say is that if you haven't seen it, please do so at the next opportunity. I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours. As a side benefit to having watched this movie, I finally have an answer to give people who ask me to name one of my favorite movies."
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,5/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" stars good looking people, some of them doing good things, others saying bad things. One of them doesn't make it through the movie. It has a simple take and a simple lesson: ""Oppression is bad.""Jojo is a young boy with a young boy's simple view of life. He admires his teachers, and they tell him to admire Hitler. So he does. But he not only admires Hitler from afar, but he interacts with Hitler right in his own room apparently as an imaginary friend/fuhrer. The director, Taika Waititi, dons a somewhat brushier mustache than the mini sported by der real Fuhrer, and plays a buffoonish version of Adolf.The overall effect is to preach an easy lesson to the young, but like an antivirus, it weakens the power of the adversary. The real Hitler was smart, quick on the uptake, and not known for his gentle humor. And the real nazis practiced mass marches, enforced obedience by the entire population, and at the very least heavy duty beatings to any opposition no matter how slight.This does not have enough of a grasp on its subject to reach the level of good satire. It remains at a level more like Hogan's Heros. It presents a candy-color superficial grasp of Nazi Germany which barely feels either Nazi or German. Compare this to a much greater movie, ""Cabaret"" which did achieve its aims.So what is gained by mounting such lightweight stuff? Does it take much courage to fight this, or is Jojo merely overcoming social embarassment? There are several character scenes in this movie, one which is traumatic to the young hero, but its effect is blunted by only showing the victim's dangling feet. It isn't badly done, but its effect is limited because such a heavy time of death and danger is trivialized, particularly at the end with some dance moves being displayed about 2 generations ahead of their development, not to mention many anachronistic expressions and asides.So I'd describe the movie as a live action comic book to present some 'bad stuff' that happened. This doesn't make it bad. But it is far from great."
JOJO RABBIT,4 November 2019,8/10,"I love Taika Waititi. Wilderpeople, Ragnarok, and now Jojo. I'm excited to see what he does with the episode of Mandalorian that he's directing. One other thing to get out of the way before reviewing. I don't like how this movie is being advertised like a Wes Anderson movie. The trailers make it seem like that but it's not that at all. It has plenty of silly but what Wes has that Taika is missing is the implied silly. Wes films have these silly moments but they don't stick out because they're so cleverly executed. With this movie... the Hitler imaginary friend seems a little odd at times.I'm ranking this at 8 but I need to watch it again. I could see this easily being pushed to 9. When I first saw the trailer to this, it was an immediate want to watch for me. My main problem with the movie is perception. Through most of the movie, it was tough to decide if this should be funny or serious. Honestly, I think you could watch it in two ways. A funny-haha movie romp or a serious movie about a kid with ingrained hate and how things aren't always what they seem.I consider this a must-see. I'm not sure if Taika meant for this to have a strong message but it definitely does. Not to sidetrack but Jojo having that hate ingrained by what's around him; I experienced that recently by my dad's girlfriend and her grandson. It was a disappointing moment seeing that happen in plain sight.I'm not sure where this movie will sit in overall movie collections but I think it will definitely stick out as one of Taika's best."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2020,8/10,"Thank you is the first thing I have to say. A ten year old boy, Jojo, is a heavily indoctrinated hitler youth, a somewhat isolated boy whose imaginary friend is Hitler. We follow Jojo through the latter stages of the war. Whilst this may not sound particularly funny, a cold hard look at the preposterous Nazi propaganda, allows this modern day dirextor to poke holes in an utterly ridiculous Nazi regime.There have been so many films in recent years that are not funny. Safe Trump bashing woke nosense about safe subjects. This film isn't amazing and is truthfully saved by some extraordinary child acting. People fail to see that humor is a great way to provide insights into tough subject matters. It doesn't take away any of the tragedy of the events and in fact there are many moments in this film that touch on some of the truly horrific nasty human cruelties, without the use of any humour.Refreshing film, worth an open minded watch."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,9/10,"I'm not going to rehash what everyone has already said. If you enjoyed the Death of Stalin, you will enjoy this one!"
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,8/10,"Very unusual, NOT a movie for young kids. A sensitive and extraordinary way to tell this story of a young boy's realisation of the horrors of Nazism. Performances all around are superb, especially by young Roman Griffin Davis. Highest praise for the treatment of a very difficult subject."
JOJO RABBIT,10 March 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a powerful anti-hate satire. Funny, but smart enough not to let the Nazis get off the hook, with a storyline that takes the audience to some deeply poignant and serious moments. Heartfelt, hilarious and witty to the extreme, feeling tonally inconsistent in many areas, it still doesn't take anything away from Taika Waititi's unique, graceful film and how it could have gone horribly wrong in the wrong hands. Luckily, what we have is a cinematic gift.Mitchell Bulfin"
JOJO RABBIT,26 October 2019,4/10,"I could see it being offensive on so many levels to so many older generation people. I mean. World War II is one of the most tragic events in modern history. On the other hand, taika waititi ,as much as a powderpuff liberal as he is ,has the gift of crafting of wonderfully hysterical movie. I'm torn. I really am. I give it a five. I choose to never be offended so I can enjoy the movie. I guess my main issue is, that the people who are constantly offended are normally liberal, Powder Puff , sjws. And I know is a fact if the director of this movie was a conservative the same people who are raving about how beautiful this movie is would be bashing it. It's the typical double standard. That being said I still recommend this movie it's absolutely brilliant"
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"Fantastic.
I was so happy - and surprised - to find a real movie among all the crap that Hollywood produces nowadays. When you step into this movie you enter a movie world with horror, comedy, satire, war, love and a lot more. Fantastic actors, great cinematography, directing and sound is all part of the experience.Do yourself a favour and step into this world for two hours, and you will have real movie magic once again. And when you step out, the movie will stay with you for a long time.If you can don't see the trailer och read too much before you see it.
Well done, all involved in this!"
JOJO RABBIT,21 March 2020,7/10,"T uses a peculiar angle and way to express the effect of mind control on a little boy. I still find it difficult to accept the strange and absurd style and the love story of the little boy and girl is not my appetite, but I still feel that the ending is full of romance and hope. Scarlett's performance was short but crucial to the plot. Just Dance!"
JOJO RABBIT,30 November 2020,10/10,"This is perhaps the most refined look at the tragic events of 75 years ago for the whole world. It's time to get rid of the oppressive patterns - and this is the main message of this picture, which does not belong to the Comedy genre. Superbly directed characters, played by talented actors, take your mind to a completely new space of perception of the events of the Hitler campaign. You are immersed in the destinies of people whose relationships are transformed in the most incredible way. 10-year-old Johannes, like a young tracker, digs into the smallest causes of the German people's hatred of the Jews and reveals with deliberately childlike directness the simple truths of universal error. Very vulnerable and kind in his soul, he throughout the tape is fighting with the foundations imposed on him, which he first praises above all feelings, but soon the victory of reason takes over the whole "" game of soldiers»...""Jojo rabbit"" is a heartwarming drama (or tragicomedy), where humor is just a defensive reaction. After all, we see the story through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy, in completely different colors, where the terrible freely intersects with something ridiculously funny. The imaginary Hitler, as Johannes realizes the whole picture of what is happening, turns from a blind, insensitive fanatic into a pathetic and vicious weakling.This film can be compared to a trip on the waves. The dynamics of what is happening are stretched to the limit, and each scene is a burst in which you share the sadness, laugh, ask yourself, and sometimes even discover something different in your own understanding of that period of history.Brilliant scenes, organic music and gorgeous camerawork! And it all sums up-a magical infectious dance at the end of the picture, which breaks all the evil and human vices. I recommend this movie to watch, both in the family circle and with friends!10/10"
JOJO RABBIT,21 June 2020,4/10,"One of the greatest comedians of all time made a movie about Hitler and the Nazis and called it The Great Dictator. It was not a comedy. It was a masterpiece.We can argue that this movie, Jojo Rabbit uses comedy to juxtapose tragedy and ridicule the Nazis and condemn them. But to do that, first the Nazis must become funny.This movie humanizes Nazis.Regardless of what it does with them later in the movie, young people of the 21st century who have no idea what Nazism is have spent time watching humanized and funny Nazis.I don't do censorship, so everyone who wants can watch this movie, no problem.I cannot condone humanizing Nazis and making Adolf Hitler cute and funny even to condemn them."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,8/10,"The film starts out as a comedy and gets serious later. I won't spoil the movie by getting into too much details.
What's good:
1. The story and screenplay are great. It is based on the novel ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunens.
2. Roman Griffin Davis gets the lead role of Jojo and he proves to be the biggest strength of the movie. All other actors have done a good job.
3. The film makes you laugh as well as think in some scenes.
4. The director shows us the power of Propaganda through this film and how one person can fool most of the people.
What's bad:
1. If you are looking for traditional entertainment, you should avoid this film.
2. Can't watch with family.
If you want to watch a different type of comedy drama, this is the film for you."
JOJO RABBIT,25 August 2020,,"It's a risky movie, but they got everything right. No it's not Schindler's List or even The Piano or Life is Beautiful. The ending was a little corny, but Jojo and all his relationships are spectacular. I could watch this movie a million times.Anyone who thinks it's not appropriate subject matter clearly didn't watch the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,18 April 2020,8/10,"All in all, Jojo Rabbit is a very special film and I love it. The Film won the People's Choice Award at the TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), which is said to be a vane for the Academy Award, and I think it deserves it. Of course, the reasonableness of this form of banter in today's political landscape and the inevitable controversy it brings are also worth pondering"
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,6/10,"There are plenty of things to like about Jojo Rabbit, the performances from the actors are all strong and there are some nice moments of comedy and poignancy. However, my big issue with the film was its portrayal of a Germany that in 1945 was on its knees, had been bombed to destruction and yet the street that the lovely Jojo lives on appears untouched. Even when we see the final battle (why oh why was there a need to show both Russian and American soldiers?) and the ruins, Jojo's street remains unblemished. The hidden Jewish girl, Elsa, would have been hiding for many years, unable to go out yet appears almost glowing. Jojo's mother, Scarlet Johansson, dresses well, has lots of make-up. To me this dilutes the power of the film, the fantasy world of Jojo would have been so much more powerful set against a realistic backdrop.
Jojo's interaction with ""Hitler"" is also problematic - he's either the product of Jojo's imagination or he isn't, but the way he behaves in some instances feels like he has a life of his own.
This could have been a classic with all the ingredients it has but ended up being a slightly above average comedy."
JOJO RABBIT,28 September 2020,10/10,"Ojo Rabbit is the funniest, loveliest, saddest and best films I've seen so far this year. Taika Waititi nailed it and this one is his Oscar gold. Mental note to start a riot if this isn't nominated for Best Picture or Best Adapted Screenplay. I was looking forward to it ever since I heard about it, and it didn't disappoint. Taika's been a fascinating director since he made the best Thor movie, and all of his projects make me more and more excited. If you're a fan of Time Bandits, he's making a new tv series with Terry Gilliam, and that's a match made in heaven. Everyone in the movie is amazing, Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, and Sam Rockwell keeps nailing it. He's amazing in every single thing he does. Scarlet Johansson plays the best movie mom since ever and Waititi is the funniest man on the face of the Earth as Hitler. Top notch writing, casting and cinematography, the entire film feels like a love letter from Taika to Wes Anderson. Funny, quippy dialogue and bright colors, just make up a beautiful film. The film couldn't have come at a more perfect time and it's slogan isn't a lie; it's a movie that goes to war on hate, and it has the best message of anything else that came out. Don't be turned off by anything about it, it's one of the funniest things I've seen, and it's all worth it. It has heart and soul and it teaches you to be a better person, and no other movie this year has accomplished that. I'll be there front and center for Time Bandits and anything else Taika does. He's becoming one of my favorite directors and he has the Midas touch. Keep on nailing it, Taika."
JOJO RABBIT,5 November 2019,10/10,"This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,4/10,"A few powerfully dramatic moments, some gifted acting by most but not all, a bizarre subplot which featured anachronistically humorous dialog, all seasoned by an odd and equally anachronistic soundtrack that detracted far more than it added. All together noteworthy and quirky, but far from all the IMDb 10's that will encourage many to see it."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,2/10,"This movie is dumb and trash, it makes fun of a serious event in a very dumb way, A lot of the scenes drag on for too long and the way they portray history is really bad for the brains of the younger generation who will just suck it up as facts.. Worst movie about hitler ever made."
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2021,10/10,"A unique film that will pull your emotions in different directions in a matter of seconds. The main character Jojo is a patriotic 10 year old Nazi loving boy, living in war time Germany. Jojo has a loving mother, a crazy make believe friend and a foe hiding in his house. Jojo has a very firm belief on how life should work, but shaped by the people in his life, Jojo slowly starts to question things? The actors all deliver good performances, with a big dose of weirdness in this dark comedy."
JOJO RABBIT,18 September 2019,9/10,"Probably one of the most controversial films to come out of TIFF, I went into Jojo Rabbit with cautionious optimism since I am fan of Taika Waititi while still being aware of the divineness it has spawned in some critics. I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.Jojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's ""kind"", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.The smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself.
Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.The cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.Jojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first."
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2020,10/10,"Wow, what a blast this movie was! I clicked on it, bacause of some distant memory of a trailer that captured my attention, so I stepped in with a blank mind. JJR grabs you immediately with its unique tone of voice that balances between satire and romance. Its absurdity is fantastic with the setting of the children of the Hitlerjugend and the Nazi groupleaders. The photography and camerawork is beautiful with its use of color and great shots full of balance and perspective. The cast is fantastic, containing Rockwell, Johansson, Wilson and ofcourse mr. Merchant who makes an unforgettable entrance. But the three children steal the show for me. The young lead is just amazing in his role as a wise, yet naive character and together with his friend and imaginary ""friend"", they are funny and heartbreaking at the same time. The young girl on the attic is amazing as well and the end of the movie made me truly emotional. But the script and its layered story is what makes this movie a genuine piece of art. It translates the horror of war and intolerance in an almost fairytale-like world where the acts of violance and loss of freedom are conveyed in such a way that the viewer has to think about it in a detached way. But without being moralistic. Best movie I've seen in 2020."
JOJO RABBIT,24 September 2020,10/10,"Such an amazing film. You will go from laughing to crying, to laughing again.Whoever gave this film a bad rating, clearly does not know what makes a great film. I am a fan of cinematography and writing. This hits all the senses!Click play, sit back, and enjoy. Trust me, it's worth it!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 October 2019,8/10,"First Hit: A fantastic black comedy that digs deep at the idiocy of the Nazi movement.Good black comedies are difficult to come by. In recent years ""The Death of Stalin"" was one such film. As I wrote the previous sentence, I realized that both films are about corrupt leaders of countries. However, I digress.In this film, Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a lonely young boy who idolizes Adolf Hitler and his movement. He lives with his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while his dad is supposedly off fighting for the Germans in Italy.To support his belief in the Nazi movement, he's created an imaginary Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who visits him in his make-believe world. His version of Hitler is off the charts hilarious. Hitler struts around making outlandish statements and sings young Jojo's praises for admiring Hitler and what he stands for.Jojo and Rosie live in a small German town. All the young boys, like him, are signed up to be part of Hitler's youth corps. His only friend Yorki (Archie Yates), is a slightly rotund young boy with glasses, and together they are heading off to a Hitler youth camp experience.The boys and girls all gathered together at the camp are dressed up in their Nazi uniforms. They are led through hilarious drills by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a drunken Nazi Youth Camp Leader, and his counterpart, Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), for the young girls.One day while in his home alone, he hears noises upstairs and discovers a young woman Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) living in a secret compartment in the walls of a room upstairs. Elsa is Jewish and is being hidden there by Rosie. Why is his mother hiding a Jew in her home? Then we learn that maybe Elsa may also be a stand-in, of sorts, for his dead sister.Although Jojo is supposed to dislike and want to kill Jews like Elsa, he discovers that she's not a bad person and that he's falling for her in his own 11-year-old boy way.Discussing all this with his imaginary Hitler is hilarious at times. The absurd statements and thoughts about what Jojo should or should not do about his captive Jew make pointed jabs at Hitler's insane ideology.As the film moves along, we sense the end of the war is near, and the German Army is starting to lose the battle against the Russians, Europeans, and US forces. They are closing in which makes Jojo's Hitler even funnier.The film is quick-paced and moves rapidly from scene to scene. The quick-paced moments are exemplified when the boys at camp and when the war comes to their little town. However, this film knows when to linger. Scenes like when Jojo and Rosie are walking along the river, or when Jojo and Elsa are writing his book about Jews. The film is also deeply touching as shown when Jojo and Yorkie are shown hugging each other several times throughout the film. It was even moving when Captain Klenzendorf saves Jojo from being imprisoned by the allies. Later, when Jojo dances with Elsa, recalling an earlier time when Jojo danced with Rosie. In these moments the film glows.
I thought the sets and costumes were fantastic and really captured the heart of the film.Davis was extraordinary as Jojo. He carried this story with a wide range of feelings, emotions, and actions. Waititi is superb as the innovative imagination of Jojo's Adolf Hitler. He uses sarcasm, expressive physical movement, and whit to define and make this character come alive. McKenzie was sublime as Elsa. Her strength and compassion while attempting to stay alive in a country that reviled her kind was, at times, riveting. Johansson was excellent as Jojo's mother. She embodied someone straddling the line of life and death along with survival and what's right wonderfully. Rockwell was over-the-top perfect for this role. When he carefully validated Elsa's papers, you knew of his heart. Wilson was well cast as Fraulein Rahm, a woman who got away with saying outlandish things. Waititi also wrote and directed this film, and it was clear he knew what he wanted, and he got it, a fun-filled touching black comedy.Overall: This was an excellent film that also reflected the struggles of the current day."
JOJO RABBIT,11 December 2019,10/10,"I was not expecting this film to be as good as it is. There's usually two things that I'm not interested in with films and that's war and Nazis, which this film was about both.Jojo Rabbit is focused around a young child named Jojo who wants to go into the war just like his father did and join the Nazis to take down the Jews.
Jojo learns that his mother is hiding a Jew in the house and picks at her knowledge to learn everything he can about the Jews to write his book. But even though he's passionate about becoming a Nazi he must keep the hidden Jew a secret for protection of himself and his mother.This movie is honestly one of my faves for the year. It reflects light and history on the past for the new generation to watch and learn without making it boring and losing interest.
I was laughing so much and enjoyed a historical film about the war which is not something I'm too keen on most of the time.Give this film a watch, you'll highly enjoy it"
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2021,10/10,"The movie conveys such a serious topic in such a comedic element its great. (with heart felt emotion at times too).This is a must watch for anyone.As someone who used to teach Army cadets, obviously in a completely different era and setting to the movie, I can 100% see some of the cadets acting the way they did and some of the instructors also."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"What a fantastic film, hilarious, especially the first half, it had the feel of a mel Brooks film for the first half, the second half of the film while having plenty of laughs was also very moving and bought a tear to my eye, especially one particular scene.
The young boy who plays jojo was very good, and the supporting cast was also excellent, a special mention to the outstanding thomasin Mackenzie, she is brilliant as the young Jewish girl, I confidently predict this girl will one day win an oscar after seeing her in this and her equally outstanding performance in leave no trace"
JOJO RABBIT,27 February 2020,1/10,"I don't think I've rated many films 1 out of 10.  I found this film extremely distasteful.I'm not a prude, I'm not sensitive, I'm not a snowflake. My views are certainly conservative for the most part.Having Hitler walking around in some kind of jesting parody fashion is grossly insulting. I found the bits of the movie I did watch to be derisive, minimising and trivialising the horrors of the Holocaust into some kind of joke thing for cheap thrills. It wasn't thrilling. I didn't smile even once.I have watched Hunters on Prime, and can't level the same complaint at that at all. Yes, the ending was 'strange' (keeping it spoiler-free) and there was definitely some licence taken and wasn't 'based on historical events' like they claimed. But I found they depicted the horrors. This film did the opposite; it made it all one big joke. Over six million Jews being gassed by the Nazis in the Holocaust is not a joke.Disgraceful film."
JOJO RABBIT,8 August 2020,7/10,"This film gives me major ""white savior vibes"". Even though Jewish people are considered ""white"" in my country, I still think the term applies. I found it problematic that the oppressors were given a slap on the wrists in this film. The Jewish girl even thanks the boy. Wtf?This film seems more concerned with making non-Jewish white people ""feel good"" rather than giving them the honest truth. In reality, Jojo and Elsa would've been killed. It makes no sense that the mother was killed but they allowed Jojo to live. Also, I do agree Elsa was a shallow character that served no other purpose but to educate the lead. Again, this is the typical ""minority teaches the oppressor about hate"" trope. Overall, it was an okay film. I just wish it could've been darker and more mature. Along with the humor."
JOJO RABBIT,16 October 2020,7/10,"A heartwarming, honest kind of movie with great performances."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,"And one that made me cry as often as I laughed. I'm admittedly biased as Waititi has been my favourite director since the first time I saw ""Eagle vs Shark"", and I've loved every film of his since.In this world where cinema seems to be on the decline and destined to maybe only exist on television at some point, and also a world where bland pablum like the endless string of superhero and action films where it is obvious in their execution that the accountants are running the show, so to speak, with films designed specifically to appeal to the widest world-wide demographic possible, films like this are such a welcome breath of fresh air.I really don't understand all the poor critic reviews, but obviously suspect it has to do with set and setting of this film, but that is part of the beauty of it. Compared to the conclusion of the Star Wars saga, a movie that was all about fan service, with no chance-taking, no surprises, no risks, ""Jojo Rabbit"" stands in such stark and positive comparison specifically because it is the director/writer's creative vision on full display.Why a touching film can't also include satire with the last days of the Third Reich as the backdrop is something completely lost on me, and smacks of more than a bit of racism, like all Germans who had to live through that era are too inherently evil to portray characters with heart and soul, and in the main character's case, not even a child seems worthy of any redemption. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what some of the critic's reviews feel like.In any case, sometimes sacred cows make for the most delicious hamburger, and the performances are all outstanding (""Leave No Trace"" was my top film of 2018, so it was a nice surprise to see the incredibly talented, and natural, actress show up in this film as well. Don't let the lack of critical acclaim make you shy away from at least giving this film 20 minutes to see if you can look past the black (and apparently also taboo-breaking) comedy/satire/drama that offends some delicate sensibilities... I'm guessing you won't be disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,9/10,"It goes without saying that the film & story are brilliant because of its writer/director but I have to say that acting was fantastic by all the all the cast, especially young Jojo - you'd think he'd been doing it years! I just hope it gets the recognition it deserves from Hollywood"
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,2/10,"Yet another movie 'correcting' young people's behaviours and feelings towards patriotism - liberal social engineering at it finest - and worst. With so many more examples of where Patriotism is a good thing, liberals still portray all Nationalism is if it is Nazis, USSR or Nth Korea. When I watch the World Cup (football) or the Olympics, I want the person of my Country to win - that is an example of when Patriotism is a good thing. Dont waste your time or money unless you are a progressive liberal in which case this is a perfect echo chamber movie."
JOJO RABBIT,8 April 2020,10/10,I laughed and I cried. I've totally felt a million emotions. We can learn about the WWII and feeling free at the same time. Just a great lesson : dance is for free people !
JOJO RABBIT,21 January 2020,7/10,Since this story is fictional i would love to see after 20 years later kind of idea it would have been a nice send off. Overall cute picture enjoyed the humour with the reality. It was a nice surprise. I believe this maybe one of those movies that it will be years before people really appreciate bit for now it was cute
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,7/10,"I was really looking forward to this movie but was a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it. I think comedy drama is a difficult genre anyway and this movie uneasily traversed the two. I think it should have been a straight out satirical comedy. The pathos when it came, just didn't sit well with the surreal lunacy of the plot. The child actors are wonderful and all of them give honest and believable performances which is an accolade given the script and what they were expected to do. The adult actors not so much. Scarlett Johansson was particularly annoying as Jojo's resistance agent mother. She didn't feel real as a character. Neither did most of the adults in this movie. I know it's a satire but some of the performances were just too cartoon like to evoke any real emotion. I did find Rebel Wilson's performance amusing but that was about it. All in all, a strange concoction which was neither witty or satirical enough to really lampoon the Third Reich and neither dramatic or heartfelt enough to portray a Germany coming to the end of its quest for World domination. I so much wanted to like this but I found it underwhelming and if I want to watch Nazis being made fun of, I prefer ""Allo Allo"" (British sitcom set in occupied France)!"
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,7/10,"Drawn by the trailer, I approached this movie expecting perhaps too much. It was not very humorous and neither was it particularly novel. The concept is fine but the execution (no spoiler intended) didn't quite succeed.
I see that Waititi has been nominated for awards for adapting the screenplay. I am now reading the book, ""Caging Skies"" and there is some similarity with the film but many differences. The focus is on different characters. The book is far from being a comedy. In ""Caging Skies"", Adolf Hitler does not appear as an imaginary friend. Johannes is much older, 14 - 20. The film uses only the first half of the book. There are many scenes that are not in the book.
The characters are stereotypical, as in the TV series ""Hogan's Heroes"" but the leads, especially Jo Jo and Scarlet Johannsen, are excellent.
This is a quirky movie and quite enjoyable but less than it might have been."
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi is a very good actor. Yes, of course, he's a brilliant director of possibly the most creative film of the year. And yes, young Roman Griffin Davis did a remarkable job portraying Jojo's journey and all the emotions he goes through. And Scarlett Johansson was marvelous as his mother trying to balance protecting her last surviving child and doing ""what she can"", like hiding a Jewish girl. And Sam Rockwell's Nazi commander drowning his shame in alchohol came across as heartbreakingly human. But if Waititi didn't hit just the right notes as the imaginary Hitler, the entire movie might not have worked. He might have been goofy, hilariously blunt, yet often supportive and encouraging, but he never stopped being Hitler. What this film reflects is the time that seemed surreal. All it really did is turn the ""sur"" up a notch. More often than not whatever is funny is also very scary. And tragedy is acutely real. It stays with you."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,9/10,"War is so horrible to the adult world, not to mention those children in war? They may be too young to understand the fragility of life and the cruelty of war, they may be fooled by others, join this war to lose their lives, War is imagined as a test of becoming an adult, knowing that you have seen your loved ones die in this war, and you have n't really grown up until then. 'War' should not be a lie we have created for children, because it is for them. Too cruel I love my country, but I hate war. ""Jojo Rabbit"" shows us the cruelty of World War II from the perspective of a child who loves 'Nazi' and Hitler enthusiastically, and wraps the core of tragedy under its comedy shell. Qiao Qiao finally realized his own growth. In this cruel war, he healed the cruel world, only love and tolerance. Accept everything that happens, beautiful and horrible, keep going, no constant emotions."
JOJO RABBIT,26 April 2020,8/10,"Taika Waiiti delivers a hilarious, tragic, and heartwarming film, depicted the idea of learning through kindness, struggle, and love. The film has surprisingly split critics, and some of them have considered it ""conversational"". However, the film despite depicting the experiences of a 10 year old in hitler's youth army during a horrible time, comes off still to be lighthearted. The film executes the idea of being brainwashed into hating very well, with great performances both comedic and dramatic, as well as a great script and beautiful cinematography, with costume and set designs achievements as well. Overall, Jojo Rabbit, is a comedic, heartbreaking, yet heartwarming film about perceptions. It proves to be crucial in the current moments of modern society"
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,8/10,"Dark gritty humor wrapped in a nice bow and illustrated through the eyes of a child.
It's amazing!"
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,7/10,"The story is not special, but the plot is clever. The comedy is also nothing special, though still enjoyable. One thing that's weird for me is Scarlet Johansson's acting, which is not major and only at the part of acting out her husband I consider good and she got nominated for best supporting actress, that's really weird for me."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2021,8/10,"The mockery of Nazism in the first half is deft and well-timed (given the recent attempted putsch), though the deftness wains heavily in the second half as an inconsistent ""serious"" tone dominates."
JOJO RABBIT,23 December 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a film about a ten year old Nazi sympathizer befriending a Jewish girl, after finding her hiding in his house. Jojo is tasked with learning the meaning of friendship and family, while fluctuating between childhood and a premature adulthood. Jojo Rabbit is based on the book, Caging Skies by Christine Leunens. The film stars Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother, Thomasin Mackenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl Jojo meets, and Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Jojo's Nazi superiors. The film is directed by Taika Waititi, who also portrays Jojo's imaginary manifestation of Hitler. The film successfully fluctuates between comedy and drama. The tone of the film is perfect.The acting in this film is fantastic. The brightest star in the film is Scarlett Johansson. Her portrayal of Jojo's mother is wondrous. Jojo's mother is a cinematically special character whose wisdom is akin to Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid. Jojo's mother nurtures the movie and adds serious dialogue where it is needed. She serves as the voice of reason within the film. Her relationship with Jojo is beautifully written, and poetic. Scarlett Johansson was perfect for the role. Roman Griffin Davis does an excellent job in portraying Jojo. He is a curious kid who does not fully have a grasp of his reality. Jojo's character development is well written, as it toys with the juxtaposition of childhood and adulthood. Initially, Jojo's circumstance is that of a child, but he feels that he's an adult. As life changing events occur within the film, Jojo's character is tasked with circumstances of adulthood, while Jojo realizes that he is a child lost in the middle of war. Jojo's character development is brilliant. The rest of the cast is great as well. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Captain Klenzendorf is another bright spot. His German accent is spot on. Despite Captain Klenzendorf's heinous crimes as a Nazi soldier, he is still presented with a sense of humanity. He serves as a father figure for Jojo. His love for Jojo is real, and it adds to the heart of the film. Generally, the casting was amazing.The writing within this film is really good. As the story progresses, it shifts from a family comedy into a family Drama. Jojo's struggle between his humanity, social awareness, and support for the Nazi party is the primary conflict. Jojo's friendship with Elsa progresses really well throughout the film. Jojo is a child filled with hate. As he grows within the film, he becomes stricken with love. The film accurately portrays the decline of Nazi Germany, in lieu of World War 2 and their heinous crimes against humanity.The direction of the film is great. Taika Waititi is a master of comedy. Foremost, his portrayal of Hitler is humorous in the sense of parody. He portrays the Nazi party as weak idiots throughout the film, as opposed to portraying them as mighty protagonists. Taika's portrayal of Hitler is lead by hilarious one-liners. Despite Nazi's being his protagonists, he captures their true nature as human garbage. Cinematically, the film is good. There's nothing groundbreaking about the cinematography. The callbacks to previous scenes is great. The film's set pieces are well done, and the grim colorization is useful in conveying the absence of freedom within Nazi Germany. There's one particular scene that is well shot and unforgettable. Jojo chases a blue butterfly, leading into a shocking reveal. The music within the film is good. The German dub of certain songs is really cool. The film's biggest flaw comes from not knowing who its audience is. Jojo is a child protagonist suitable for a rated PG or G film. His environment is incredibly graphic and borderline R Rated. At times the film feels too child-like, or too adult oriented.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a great movie that is very charming, fun, and emotional. It's a great coming of age story that successful captures the innocence of childhood, while juxtaposing the harsh realities of adulthood."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2021,,This movie is funny while being a drama and a unique story . It was so entertaining
JOJO RABBIT,17 October 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies to be produced in recent years!The plot seems a bit weird and shouldn't work, but the excellent acting, production, dialogue and soundtrack somehow pull off an amazing movie!The acting is superb, the children especially. The dialogue makes you cry like a baby, then wet your pants laughing. The production and cinematography is fantastic. The soundtrack is awesome.I find it hard to find much fault. Well worth a watch and adding to your collection!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,7/10,"Everyone is saying this is good satire and praises and praises but did we see the same movie? It's funny and satirical for the first half, then when the mom gets killed all jokes and satire don't seem funny anymore. I mean there are good jokes and satire after the mom dies but they fall flat and you don't feel like laughing anymore. The kid for friggin sake was grabbing on to his moms feet when she was hanged and cried and cried. Ho ho ha ha very funny! What is wrong with all of you? It didn't become dark but it became more serious.Besides, most of the jokes are already in the trailers. Now the movie on itself is unique and good. Nothing like it has been done before, just maybe Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds where he makes Hitler into a doofus. But I just don't like the false advertising this movie is doing. The trailers and tv spots are showing this as a whacky funny laugh out loud comedy. For most part of the film it isn't for the reasons stated above. I also wouldn't call it a dark comedy, because it isn't.I was hoping that this would be a satire on the Hitler Youth as this movie was promoted, with bungling cute kids who mess things up and don't know right from left.But one thing I'd like to say: Scarlett Johansson will hands down most probably 100% win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. I say this because it's her best performance since Lost in Translation, and I'm thankful she's out of those awful Marvel movies. The studio will push for supporting actress because it's easier to win even though she is the lead actress."
JOJO RABBIT,3 August 2020,1/10,"Who the hell wrote this?
Not funny at all.
Flat dialog flat story
Stupid accents nothing to do with German accent
Badly made characters.
This movie worth not a penny.I regret to watchDirector/writer/and goofy adolf is terrible bad:(
The basic idea could be great but he has not too good.
Way more opportunities in this film than a Hollywood mind can ever realize.
Same this material wasted.Thomasin McKenzie has real talent, She act so well.
Such a waste her talent for this movie.
Feel sorry for her.
Only reason have not stopped to watch after 30 minutes is her play.I dont understand the other actors and actresses.
What are they doing in this film? They just there but no action. No fun, no passion.Some action from Scarlet J but few seconds later killed by the bad movie.3 good joke in the entire movie.Some parts could be moving but immediately killed by bad director and wrong characters.As always, it could be a great movie of Hollywood dont ever touch it."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,6/10,"So everyone is saying this is not a comedy film & it turns dark throughout the film which is correct, but it has a mix of both rather than one or the other, the thing is with the dark parts to the film it is deemed normal within the film as of course back then it was normal for Nazis so laugh at Jews, for example; one scene JoJo makes a book about Jews and how bad they are, but when the german guards come in to check the house for a Jew hiding in the house they come across the book & all the guards read it & laugh about that it is in the book, but of course to them that is normal back then & portrayed as normal which does make you think.But for the funny parts to the film they are in pockets throughout the film, Adolf (Played by Taika Waititi him self) as JoJo's imaginary friend is a great addition to the film as he pops up & does really funny things & says some funny things as well, but if it was nor for Adolf there would be far less funny parts which gets me onto my next point, apart from the Adolf parts there was not that much overall in the film, the beginning of the films starts off on a role with the comedy but then seems to fall flat through the mid section of the film which we (4 of us that watched it) ll said it felt flat & just talking & was a bit boring tbh, that's why i think without the funny parts the film would no where be as good hence why i didn't rate it that high.Overall it is defiantly a watch because either way its a different take on war style films but not being about all guns & blazing violence for once.Age - 25
Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)
Watch, Avoid, Consider: Watch for both sides of the film, whether fo the comedy or the more deeper parts to the film."
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2021,6/10,"I really liked how it started, the comedy was a pleasant change from the usual Nazi drama. It unravelled as it attempted to mix comedy moments and really serious events interchangeably, which really spoiled the movie for me. The tone was all over the place."
JOJO RABBIT,19 November 2020,,"I am a fan of Taika and I thought that he did a really fantastic job of dealing with some difficult subjects in Boy. But I am afraid this was a bridge too far for me. I found it neither funny nor moving. Britain cannot produce great child actors like the Americans do. Shrinky-dink adults that could out act Di Nero! British child actors all seem like they are taking part in the school play and there was no exception here. I love that Taika aimed for something original in a climate of re-makes and Marvel franchise, sorry I didn't enjoy it."
JOJO RABBIT,20 April 2020,9/10,"This movie had great characters, production value, and one of the best story arcs I've seen this year.
The actors are amazing in this movie. They do a hilarious job mimicking the silent despair of the German people towards the end of World War II. It made for some good but dark humor. The characters had great chemistry. Especially between the main character and his friend. I loved them together.
The production value was great. The costumes and sets were definitely on point and looked historically accurate. The camera angles and editing was well done.
The story was great. Like said above it had one of the best story arcs I've seen in a while. And I loved the message of the story. And that beginning sequence is simply amazing.
This movie deserves every award it received."
JOJO RABBIT,3 April 2021,8/10,"How can a movie makes you smile and cry at the same time? This movie is just brilliant. The story is original. A kid with Hitler as imaginary friend! Now that's something hilarious. The cast is perfect, the actors and actresses doing great. This is a different take on WW2. You really need to watch this."
JOJO RABBIT,26 October 2019,9/10,"A fascinating, moving, funny, multi-layered movie experience. Memorable. Not really a satire or a comedy. Wonderful set decoration and attention to period clothes. Many surprising twists and turns done with style and imagination and, despite the war and Nazis, gentleness. A Wes Anderson-esque examination of the effect of fanaticism and war on a society, a town, on families, on children and on one particular sweet little boy. The end, which could have been saccharine, over the top, or forced...perfect instead. With a perfect soundtrack sending us out of the theater, but making sure that JoJo, and his mom, a good German, will live on in our imaginations."
JOJO RABBIT,19 March 2020,8/10,"Interesting and meaningful,l like it!!!The cruelty of world war ii, mind control of the terrible, topsy-turvy beliefs, and wish the magic everywhere, were fairytale style and absurd sense of humor, dilute the strict setting pathetique, and K captain with despicable dirty words finally accomplished cry into the lacrimal point, the film clear too clearly between good and evil, or reveal too ideal beautification naive, weakened the terrible mental control and dramatic conflict."
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,8/10,"After seeing the trailer i wasn't sure this would be a movie that I'd appreciate. It's quite a heavy subject that's hardly suitable to be put into a comedic perspective. Just, don't do it! It's so easy to screw this up, so yes, i was quite sceptical and actually planning not to watch it. But my wife was really curious, and this guy also made ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" ... so after some debating we decided to give it a go.
After 5 minutes it already became clear that it wasn't what i thought. I won't go into the details to prevent spoilers, but it turned out rather charming and mostly from a point of view of the 10 year old main character, JoJo, which puts everything in the right perspective.
There's a dip somewhere halfway where things start to get a little stale, but that quickly turns into a interesting and captivating finale.
No, it's definitely not as heavy, deep and captivating as Schindler's List or The Pianist, and for sure will rub on some people the wrong way considering the light-hearted and comedic nature. But there's definitely a more deep and moving storyline that i find charming and reminded me somewhat of Pan's labyrinth.
WO2 was nothing like what this movie is portraying. But it's also not ignoring it. It just shows it from the naive view of a 10 year old. Not sure what's so wrong about that. Especially since it's absurdism is so obvious. It's not trying to kick people against the knees.
Still, maybe Waititi shouldn't have picked this subject, because it's on one hand a little cheap to pick one of the biggest horrors in history as contrast for your jokes, but on the other hand, it's working because of the horrors of the subject.
For me it's way more interesting and less offensive as the mainstream pulp like the 101 brainless superhero movies that comes from Hollywood.
Keep going Waititi, i've been a fan since ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and will look forward to your next flick."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,,"'m sorry but this film is a disgrace. Humour and satire are one thing, but this subject matter is the last thing ion this world to wrap comedy around. I went to see this under sufferance, but in the hope that it wasn't quite as unpleasant as it seemed from the trailer - unfortunately it was every bit as disgraceful, and I really cannot believe the accolades it is getting from others on here. Given that Hollywood is 6000 miles from Berlin means that the real impact of Hitlers WW2 never really resounded with the USA in the way it did in Europe, or maybe out millennial generation really do believe that hanging and gassing are something to laugh about - either way they should give their heads a real big shake...... disgusting, and Academy Awards, you're having a laugh"
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,8/10,"A lovingly crafted and enjoyable feature. Full of great performances and tongue in cheek humour. It's hard to single out any one cast member for special mention but, having said that, Sam Rockwell is wonderful as always. It touches all the right spots and it's bittersweet moments will have you feeling the emotions of the characters. We need more of these types of movies. Stories > Special Effects."
JOJO RABBIT,30 August 2020,10/10,"I went into this film with relatively low expectations on the basis of not really knowing what it was going to be about and hoping that it wouldn't be an awkward mix of poor comedic timing and a lacklustre attempted message. But wow! I mean wow! Waititi balances the comedy and the story itself perfectly and I honestly feel there is something for everyone in this film. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll also want to learn every word to the german version of Heroes by David Bowie!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2021,9/10,This movie is one of the best dark humor movies I laughed and I cried at the same time.
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,4/10,"To us the movie was a sleeper. Not Funny At All and just plain bla.....
Some group of people are OBVIOUSLY overrating this movie for some reason or another.
Some, maybe not fair people, are rating this movie as a 10!
A 10!....Seriously??
They are saying that this nonsense is One Of The Best Films Ever Made???
They are rating it The Best Of The Best???
Come On Folks....If you are going to rate movies, rate them fairly.
These people MUST be connected to the studios in one way or another because NO ONE, with a clear conscience, could rate this movie a 10...Trust Us.
NOW:
As far as the movie itself....wait until you can stream it for free. NEVER pay to go see this anywhere because I believe you will be extremely sorry for wasting your money.
Just our opinion and Obviously, based on the high ratings, we are in the minority."
JOJO RABBIT,11 December 2020,2/10,"You can make comedys over hitler and faschism and you can make dramas, that explain how antisemitism and faschism worked and still works. Tarantinos ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a good example of the first and Hanekes ""Das weiße Band"" a good example of the second category.Jojo starts of as an mediocre satire, but as soon as anne frank enters the stage, it becomes a wannabe explanatory children book. it just looks at oversimplified cliche versions of nazis and antisemitism, changes from laughter to crying tears and back to loughter, just for the affect. Nothing more. And this is dangerous, because its downplaying that faschism and antisemitism work in much smarter ways than shown in the film.It doesnt expose new insights like a really good satire like chaplins big dictator did. its a failed experiment."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,8/10,"I went into this only knowing that it's Taika playing Hitler as an imaginary friend to a Hitler Youth. I expected a comedy, what I got was a an incredible satire with comedic elements. This movie is deep and beautiful. I put it up there pretty close with Schindler's List, thought it's not quite THAT brutal.Since I don't want to give any spoilers, I can only say that I truly believe you will not be disappointed with it. To make a movie such as this with such a controversial subject and do it so well shows sheer brilliance on Taika's part."
JOJO RABBIT,18 September 2020,10/10,"I hesitated for so long to watch this movie as it sounded too quirky and strange. But because there are so many excellent actors in it I finally watched it. What an absolutely pleasant surprise! Brilliant story, the cast amazing, cinematography gorgeous, costumes perfect! Roman Griffin Davis amazing as was Taika Waititi and Thomason McKenzie. Scarlett Johansson an absolutely perfect Rosie. And, of course, the wonderful Sam Rockwell. This will be a classic for a long time to come."
JOJO RABBIT,8 August 2020,1/10,I found the attempt at satire and comedy to be stretched so far that it snaps into disappointment. The overacting on top of the week dialog and outrages silly language comes across as a juvenile attempt of story telling. I found the attempt at comedy to be embarrassing. What was supposeD to be sad fell short and eye rolling.
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is one of the most superb movies released this year. It may appear as just a comedy taking the mickey out of Nazis, but it's so much more than that. This movie is a beautifully told story about a boy who, through being manipulated and brainwashed through properganda, is absolutely obsessed with and idolises Adolf Hitler, then slowly starts to realise how cruel the Nazis are. Roman Griffin Davis delivers the best child performance I've ever seen in a movie. His delivery is always perfect and he's never wooden. The supporting cast are all fantastic, the standouts being Sam Rockwell and Thomasin McKenzie. When the movie becomes serious, it can be genuinely tragic and moving and the depiction of the atrocities of the Nazis is incredible. Not a single act is made up. Everything the Nazis do, think and say in this movie, they did, thought and said in real life. Jojo Rabbit is an astonishingly amazing cinematic achievement that deserves your attention. Please go and see this masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,10/10,"If any film or story can brilliantly define the absurdity of racism with humour and emotion, Jojo Rabbit is the bomb. Taika Waititi takes us on a spiritual journey of WWII Nazi Germany with a whipping sharp wit screenplay adapted from Christine Leunens's (Caging Skies). It will make laugh till you drop then in the same breath will have you crying as the story hits you in the heart. Taika also directs and acts which adds to how incredibly insane this film is.We meet the ten year old Jojo who is keen to be part of the Nazi party and impress his hero and ""imaginary friend"" Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Jojo goes off to train with the Hitler Youth and Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). Through ""funny"" circumstances Jojo is injured and discharged. We meet mother (Scarlett Johannsen) who is hiding a secret, a Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin Mckenzie). This is where the story really goes to the next level as Jojo is caught between his beliefs and life unexpectancies. The friendship that eventuates is heartfelt and memorable.All the actors are fantastic with standouts from Rockwell and Mckenzie (whom should get an award nod). We are going to witness the making of a new pioneer in cinema. You will not forget the name Taika Waititi."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,10/10,"A movie comes along that rolls numerous genres into one and the elements all fit. A satire, anti-war, social commentary, love story. Has a Wes Anderson feel to it and if you like him, you'll love this. Impossible to single out a performance as everyone is excellent. One of THE movies of 2019"
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"It's very rare that I watch a movie and am blown away, the joy and sadness was overwhelming at times, the movie flowed from one heartwarming moment to the next and with moments of true sadness from the very start to the last minutes, I actually felt like clapping which is not like me, this is not hyperbole its one of my favourite movies of the past 10 years"
JOJO RABBIT,6 November 2019,10/10,"Just watch it and see for yourself. My opinion, it was hilarious and heartfelt. The acting was superb. The story was thought provoking. It was funny at times and heartbreaking at times. I'm a huge fan of What We Do in the Shadows and I am huge fan of JoJo Rabbit. Go support this film in the theatre so more films like this can be made. I can't wait to see what Taika Waititi does next🙏🏻
P.S
I'm a Jew"
JOJO RABBIT,7 March 2020,6/10,"The purpose is interesting but it's not funny, stylish or deep enough. A more talented director, like Wes Anderson, would had made a better movie from this plot."
JOJO RABBIT,30 May 2020,5/10,Finally saw this and I didn't get the hype for it in the end. It had a few funny scenes but nothing stellar. It won an Oscar bc the director is creative and talented and the academy wants to encourage his work
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,4/10,"This is a bit too much of everything in my opinion, coldly calculated only for superficial comedy effects, which are not so funny at all. It neither worked as a satire, nor a drama. You feel the strong effort throughout, they wanted to be original, they wanted to be daring, they wanted to be emotive. Ever so strongly.
I am always a bit frustrated when I feel this effort a bit too much while watching.
They didn't fail completely, the boy is cute, some sequences are entertaining, but sometimes emotional efforts fall flat and turn sentimental. It's not enough for a classic. Watch Lubitsch or Chaplin instead."
JOJO RABBIT,25 March 2020,8/10,"When I heard aboout this movie, I seriously thought it had everything to go wrong. After all, it's not easy to make comedy with such a dark and tragic subject.However, this movie does it astonishingly well. It is hilarious, deeply moving and in absolute respect to the tragedy of the time.It trully amazed me how this movie could bring so much light into such a dark subject.Besides, it sends a powerfull message about how dangerous and pointless fanaticism really is."
JOJO RABBIT,21 March 2020,3/10,I don't know what this story was meant to be. Wasn't cohesive at all. Didn't make any sense.
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,10/10,"If you don't love this movie, there is no hope for you. I laughed and ugly cried with a theater full of strangers and I am just happy that this movie exists."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,8/10,"Very dark humour, but just so touching too. You'll fall in love with the young actors, an amazing job all round - Lil Yorki 🤓. Saying that, it amazes me how Rebel Wilson gets repeated gigs - dull one trick pony.Cracking movie with laughs and very poignant moments. Well done, JoJo."

JOJO RABBIT,11 July 2021,9/10,"Let everything happen to you
Beauty and terror
Just keep going
No feeling is final.-Rainer Maria MilkeTaika Waititi is a gem. Director, actor, writer. You can see that he cares so very deeply and yet finds levity in everything. ""What we do in the shadows"". ""Thor Ragnarok"". The first is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and the latter is also fantastic. What an inspiring movie this was. It is also depressing that people actually believed the things we laughed at in JoJo's book. At times it's so very obvious that we are a half a chromosome from a chimpanzee... And yet that can make all the difference in the end."
JOJO RABBIT,19 April 2020,9/10,"The movie focuses on children, but it is more like adults seeking a simple explanation for complex and profound social problems. There are some touching and lovely places, but they are all more like formulas. And if I did show it to the children, why did the Nazis cause this crucial problem and their connection to the present society seemed to be avoided. The overall feeling is that this year's Green Paper ..."
JOJO RABBIT,25 October 2019,10/10,"Movie was better than I expected from news media reviews. The realistic costumes, uniforms, military vehicles contributed to the authenticity of film atmosphere. Taika waititi? After 'what we do in the shadows', I knew this was coming...I wish there were more satirical movies like this--waititi's treatment of wall street capitalistic parasites, for example. I mostly do a lot of research on the last great war, never knew it could be mined for comedy, though...Sort of like a child's POV of movie, catch -22... ..."
JOJO RABBIT,31 March 2020,10/10,A film good enough to watch several times over. Very well layered. I can't remember when I last saw a movie so well put together. A true emotional rollercoaster.
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit absolutely deserves to be in the best picture race right now, I have never watched a single film that has made me laugh and cry in the very same film and this one does. The acting is superb every character feels like they are there for a purpose and are all useful to the movie in one way or another. There are times where the screenplay is truly masterful as well as the visual storytelling. There is on aspect this style of storytelling that involves shoes that is absolutely brilliant and I would almost compare it to the red jacket sequence in Schindler's List in terms of how striking it was. When the film wants to be funny it is and when it wants to be sad and change the tone halfway through it does that so effectively. The humour isn't just dumb as well it is a way of showing how ridiculous some of the beliefs and propaganda of the Nazis were, which I thought was brilliant.I do have some negatives with film though, whilst the tonal change in the movie is done very effectively it tries to be funny again midway through a sequence that is quite sad and it doesn't feel right in the situation. Also the film has about 10 minutes in the beginning of the 2nd act that I thought had some very slow scenes.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is one of my favourite films this year and adds another yes another excellent film to 2019's list of great films. I truly believe this is the strongest year of film maybe ever and I hope you go and see this movie as this stands near the top of them all."
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,6/10,"I felt so uncomfortable watching this films since one moment they make Jokes, the vet Next people is hanging, they make Jokes yet the kid psyche is all Dark ... They do Jokes yet you can feel the dread of War...wtf ... If you want to make a comedy fully commit to It... Anyway it was weird but not Bad"
JOJO RABBIT,21 April 2020,5/10,"JoJo Rabbit. This Is Heartwarming , Dark Twisted And Thought Provoking Comedy-War Movie. Oscar Winner For Best Adapated Screenplay.Script Of This Story Is Historical Correct And Well Researched , Differnet View Of Nazi's - Jew's War.Story Is Positively Amazing And Cute, Director Taika Waititi Himself Acted In This Movie. All Actors Performed Very Well , It Will Gives You Hillarious Laugh.Highly Recommended, Those Who Like Different Genre With Strong Acting."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,4/10,There were far too many dead spots in this film where too little happens and the film just turns silly. Was looking forward to this film but was simply bored through most of it.
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,9/10,"Wow! The script was absolutely brilliant...the best WWII film since Life is Beautiful. Roman Griffin Davis is a great little actor with many memorable performances in his future. Sam Rockwell always delivers A+ performances and this was no exception. From beginning to end, this film takes hold of the audience's emotions. The BEST film of 2019."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,8/10,"A very impressive movie about the hatred the manipulation and the heartstrings in pain from both sides, the Germans and the Jewish. It was an interesting take on the views Hitler had and the experiences the children went through. I found the deception of the movie well played by a very young Ronan Griffiths Davis. The acting was superb the sets were as realistic as I can only imagine it would've been. Well I'm not gonna give this movie a 10 out of 10 I strongly agree with all the high ratings that this movie told the story for a different angle. And if there's anything to take from this movie it is that everyone perceives things from what they're told what they experience and from the own view point."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,10/10,"JOJO RABBIT: I can only imagine the conversation: 'Here's an idea. Let's make a movie about the Hitler Youth in Germany during the latter stages of WWII, and put it all on the shoulders of an unknown 11 year old kid and put up 14 million dollars to do it.' Ya gotta be kidding, right? Well guess what folks. They did it and it's a delight. If you think 'Springtime for Hitler' from The Producers was funny, you'll love Jojo. Jojo is a 10 year old boy in the Hitler Youth who's imaginary friend is The Führer himself, played with delicious buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi. Scarlett Johanson is just wonderful as Jojo's mom and Thomasin McKenzie as the little Jewish girl who is hidden away in a secret room in their home is just delightful. Sam Rockwell is ridiculously funny as the H.Y. commander and is backed up beautifully by Rebel Wilson (whom I generally don't care for). Jojo's friend, Yorki is played by Archie Yates and is also outstanding. The dialogue is original and funny, the physical comedy hits the mark every time while the background story is poignant and sometimes sweet in a very honest and real way. The training scenes are hysterical. The direction, the dialogue, the sight gags are perfectly edited and the period production values are first rate. The kid who plays Jojo (Roman Griffin) is absolutely phenomenal: Has incredible range, cute as a button, spot on reactions, brilliant comic timing, so honest and believable, endearing and handles the pathos in a genuine way. I'd love to see the cast get the Ensemble SAG Award just so this kid could win. Not only that, he should get an Oscar nom for his performance because the kid carries the movie. Score: 9.5. GO! You'll hiel this one. 1/10/20"
JOJO RABBIT,25 October 2019,9/10,"The only fair way to judge a movie is by how well it lives up to own its aspirations, and in the case of Jojo Rabbit, it is a stellar success. Writer/director Taika Waititi tells the coming of age story of 10-year-old German boy, Johannes (Jojo), who is being brought up in the Hitler Youth during the final months of the second world war. When Jojo learns that his mother is harboring a jewish girl in their attic, he must confront his ideals and face the truth that Nazis are nothing, if not absurd. The manner in which Waititi handles the absurdity of the Nazis, both with his writing and his portrayal of an imaginary Adolf Hitler, is pure comedic genius. His approach works because he creates humor in both surface-level and subtle layers. As a comedy, completely divorced from its subject matter, Jojo Rabbit would still be riotously funny thanks to the physical comedy and all-star line deliveries from every cast member. And with the subtext of taking away power from Nazi propaganda and ideals, reducing them to cartoonish manifestations of a boys imagination, this film succeeds to an even greater degree. Jojo Rabbit never aspires to tell the harrowing truth of the Holocaust or to completely dismantle the Nazi ideology because from the perspective of a young boy learning to love rather than hate, those beats would be out of place. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is prove that we can all change into a better person, simply by doing what we can. Although the comedy and heart of this film are the main attraction, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that from a purely technical and narrative perspective, Jojo Rabbit is equally fantastic. The film is gorgeously shot and edited, with some of the best visual storytelling I've seen this year. Waititi has thoroughly cemented himself as a contemporary master, and I can't wait to see where he goes from here. Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, heart-warming, and easily one of the best cinematic experiences of the year."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,10/10,"It has been a long, long while since I have seen a film that hits me like JoJo Rabbit. It scores on all points, hilarious, touching, and beautifully acted as well. And despite what pseudo critics jer* -offs like Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian thinks, this film is a true gem. I would gladly nominate it for film of the year. For those who wanted a more ""serious"" tone about the atrocities of WWII this is probably NOT the film for you. Any idiot (like Bradshaw) could easily tell from the trailers that this film wasn't going to be say..""Saving Private Ryan."" It was going to be a comedy. And what a comedy it was!! I found myself laughing all the way through (albeit there are some heart wrenching parts where I was tearing up). But that's what a TRULY GREAT film should do.. make you laugh, feel and sometimes cry. Great performances all around (especially the newcomer to me) Archie Yates who plays Jojo's best friend Yorkie. What a beautiful film all around!! Screw the critics and see this magic for yourselves."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,8/10,"JoJo Rabit is certainly to be divisive in audience response. The beginning is hard to swallow because of how lightly the film handles the evils of Naziism, but once you get used to the characters and the premise, it gets easier. Different Genres are blended together quite well and seem to be Waititi's trademark. Some scenes were very powerful, and shows the potential that Waititi has, but a lot of other great moments are undercut or bookended by Comedy, which is also Waititi's trademark. It is certainly a very different film and can be funny and serious at the same time. I would suggest checking it out, but be ready for some real gut punches."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,7/10,This was a Movie I Wasn't Excited for But after Watching it It's Hilarious this Makes me even more excited to see what Taika Waititi Does Next both Star Wars and Marvel Overall I Highly Recommend this Funny Film for Everyone
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,8/10,"If you think this is like a ""ha ha comedy"", you will be quite wrong. Moving story, as tragedy is seen and involves this little German kid, and he shares his story."
JOJO RABBIT,22 November 2020,10/10,"I love it. Finally, a decent real movie in this era of superhero, gory horror, remake and sequel craps we have been offered relentlessly.The acting was superb. I love those kid actors. They were not over the top so it helps the movie believable. The cinematography was fantastic as well. The movie might be a comedy but it doesn't try to make light of the dehumanization from the war but at the same time presents the fact that there were humans involved on both sides."
JOJO RABBIT,14 December 2019,9/10,"This comedy/drama of World War II is very refreshing with a great film debut from young Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, a young boy striving to be a Nazi.Taika Waititi, who both directs and plays a imaginary friend to Jojo version of Hitler, adds an distinct and independent feel to all the films he's involved in (eg. Thor: Ragnarok).Not only does this film have compelling characters, but it also has a large amount of comedy which is all very enjoyable and not lame. I haven't felt like this about many films but Jojo Rabbit compelled me for the whole duration of the film witnessing its funny humour and very deep moments with his mother. A very beautiful and refreshing film!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,9/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" Review
(9/10)Jojo Rabbit aims to tackle the difficult subject matter blind devotion and a coming-of-age film with grace and comedic flair that just works, and I absolutely love Hitler Waititi.
The coming-of-age story paired with the imaginary friend trope is as old as it comes but there are always different ways to approach it. In this case, director Taika Waititi decided the best way to address this is to go all the way to 11 and embrace it whole hog. Jojo's Adolf is the kind of happy and supportive imaginary friend we see all the time, the Hobbs to Jojo's Calvin, but the juxtaposition of it being Hitler is part of the shock value. It also gives us insight into what kind of little boy Jojo is.
The point, ultimately, comes down to the fact that there isn't anything that remarkable about Jojo. He's exactly the right age and temperament to buy completely into the propaganda that Nazism was putting out at this point in the war. He's just a normal little kid except for the fact that he is convinced that all Jews are evil monsters that are trying to kill him. That changes when he meets Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) a young Jewish girl that Jojo's protective mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is trying to keep safe. Being so close to the perceived ""enemy"" is a bit of a wake-up call for Jojo and the reality of the world around him comes like a kick in the teeth.
That aforementioned gut punch is one of the reasons that Jojo Rabbit works as well as it does. By the time the third act rolls around the movie isn't being subtle at all because there isn't any need to be. Jojo has had his wake up call and it's like the whole world around him shifts as his perspective of the world changes. The world has been collectively looking for ways to cope with the horrors of World War II since the moment the war ended and there have been a few people calling Waititi out for this approach. He is far from the first filmmaker to make Hitler look silly but what makes Jojo Rabbit so well is the human element. We aren't just seeing Hitler we're seeing Hitler through the eyes of a young boy who has complete faith in the institution he's involved in.
Jojo Rabbit is one of those movies that is going to drive a lot of people away because of the concept alone. However, it's a wonderfully funny movie that keeps a good pace and never feels boring. The shift toward the end of the second act is a gut punch and it makes the end of the movie all the more powerful for it."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,8/10,"When it comes to world war there are a lot good movies out there. But very few of there a comady. And even out of these there are very few one which we could say that it's a good comady movie based on world war and this is one of them.
The thing which makes this movie different from rest of world war movies were that most of the world war movies either shows people fighting in the war for their country or misery of people leaving in that time period( in short basically the serious stuff). Though in this movie also those serious stuffs are being showing but the way in which the story moves on makes them funny and some times emotional also.
The second thing which i liked about thing one was that there are very few movies depicting the world war through the eye of a child and that also of a Nazi kid makes it more special.
The funny interaction of the Jojo and the Hitler also adds a charm in the movie. Overall this movie is good and is not going to make you feel bored even not a single time. This movie is just flawless."
JOJO RABBIT,19 March 2020,9/10,"With a child's perspective, the film reinterprets the ideology of war and power, reaffirming a universal value that is not new, but one that needs to be emphasized in particular today: that gratuitously hatred is rooted in ignorance, and that when we let go of our prejudices, we find ourselves as human beings. Jews don't have horns. German children are just children."
JOJO RABBIT,25 September 2021,8/10,"Made me laugh and made me cry. The comedy in the movie had me laughing loads and then soon after made me cry, the differences in the movie between all the characters was incredible. I would 100% recommend watching this movie!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,10/10,You cant watch this film without laughing and wiping your tears. Great acting and great screenplay. Sure Watch
JOJO RABBIT,11 March 2020,8/10,"A movie which remembers Hitler cannot always be a good thing, after watching this all coins have a opposite way.Jojo performance was a revolution from start to end and was a good way for movies to remember very old bad times."
JOJO RABBIT,29 July 2020,9/10,"Natural acting, innocent comedy, very dramatic, good historical storytelling, beautiful pictures, and thus I feel sorry for people who never seen this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,26 April 2020,8/10,"The film is not a critical piece of serious literature directed against the evil, dark, or even radical actions of the nazis. It's anti-hate. It's a smart move to reduce some of the controversy over the director's nazi-themed comedy. And when the last film, when we saw the leading role is so hidden in the darkness of the environment is still strong to grow up, and find the light, is a source of even better to resolve the dispute, will race, war, rebellion, hegemony and other sensitive topics are moderately bypass, only pay attention to jo-jo the child's mind world and his life. That's a big part of the film's success."
JOJO RABBIT,29 July 2021,6/10,"The story was interesting, the acting i thought could have been better but its not terrible, some of the humor landed and some of it didn't. In all it was a decent watch."
JOJO RABBIT,12 March 2020,8/10,"Mixing emotional drama with light-hearted comedy is nothing new-it's been done to death. Especially WWII stories. I personally have never watched ""Life is Beautiful"" or any other films of that blend but I can kinda picture how the story goes along. ""Jojo Rabbit"" does not move along in that direction. The majority of the film is light hearted and comical (with dashes of drama in between), until Jojo (played with great charm by Roman Griffin Davis) loses his mother (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson). As much as this film is about humanity and the effects of war, it's ultimately a coming of age story. Jojo grows up, he even kick's his imaginary Adolf Hitler (played by the writer-director of this film) out of the window. All the performances were great, the lines are all funny, and the use of music was really spot on. It was really worth going to a theater farther away from my house."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,1/10,"I have a Rule! If a film shows cruelty to animals, even though I know it's make believe the film is OVER for ME! END OF STORY.
Minutes into this movie I stopped watching.
I'm sure the rest of the movie had a good message overall and was well made with good intention. But to even risk showing animal cruelty to possibly gullible and impressionable people (You Know they are out there) who would try to copy this cruelty is a non starter. End of Story!"
JOJO RABBIT,31 October 2019,10/10,"If you don't like this movie, you're a monster, this is perfectly balanced and even when the laughs died at the middle of the movie, it's still poignant and powerful! this is one of the best movies so far and Scarlett Johannsen should be nominated for an Oscar!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 June 2020,9/10,"Firstly, Taika Waititi is amazing both as director and actor. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler was amazing. The movie tries to show the horrors of the Nazi regime and also how humanity lived even amongst the horrors. Every character was memorable. In the end you even start rooting for Captain K, who initially can only be seen as a man wanting to get back at war from the Nazi side. I loved Scarlet Johansson as Rosie Betzler. She touches your heart in several scenes. Even Yorki, JoJo's best friend, leaves subtle messages from time to time. Roman as Jojo and Thomasin as Elsa were great. It's a good movie and something you can cherish again and again."
JOJO RABBIT,29 February 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit demonstrates that there is hope, both for humanity and Hollywood. By the latter I mean it's hard to imagine how a film this original got made in an era of reboots, remakes, sequels and prequels (mostly bad)The characters are charming and quirky, the dialogue clever and the plot wisely confines itself to telling an intensely personal story rather than one of the war itself. The young male star is perfect, and the other performances shine as well. It does seem though that Scarlett got less time on the screen than she deserves.The director cleverly doesn't show us certain things, and a lot of good choices were made in the editing room.Hollywood, if you're listening, more like this please."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,8/10,"The story is proof of the adage 'Kill them with kindness' when what we really want to kill is hatred. Director Taika Waititi takes one of the most gruesome moments of human history and finds humour and beauty in narrating it. (I can only remember Mel Brooks doing something similar before with The Producers - in a completely different story though.) Surrounded by well known, seasoned actors (Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson), the two children - Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie - stand out. And Waititi in the role of the imaginary Hitler is hilarious. Be prepared to laugh out loud in one scene yet cry your heart out in the next.
It's a story that needs to be told over and over again because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail."
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2020,10/10,"World through the eyes of a young child named JoJo. A sensitive piece of art which address war ,love, patriotism and the conflict between each."
JOJO RABBIT,6 April 2020,10/10,"If I was forced to watch a movie of my own choice over and over for eternity, I would pick Jojo Rabbit without a moment of hesitation.
This is one of those movies that entertains you from the first moment to the last."
JOJO RABBIT,24 March 2020,8/10,The film has a good message for those people who don't use of their brain and follow parties without any good reason !
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,9/10,"This movie has made me feel so good from the beginning to the end, and still after watching the movie. I've never watched a movie that made me feel good especially with the movies based on wars. This movie is about the ideology. It shows that how ideology can sweep up people's mind to the extreme, but then it also shows that the ideology can never win. I give 9/10 because the scene with Jojo confronting Hitler at the end could have done better. It's just that Jojo's action just doesn't incorporate with the whole movie well."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,10/10,"I got interested in this movie after the Oscars and watched this movie just out of curiosity to see Hitler's caricature.Boy, I was amazed at it or what!!!This movie had me laughing out loud and at the same time, made me cry. The experience is so unique. There are so many WWII films which deal with the action on the front or the politics behind the war, but this perspective of the period is untouched. And making a comedy film out of this and making it as emotional as it can be is just superb...Definitely going to stay in our minds for a very long time..."
JOJO RABBIT,4 May 2020,3/10,"Only an idiot can make a comedy based on such a ""funny"" matter.
Garbage. Except for the final song, of course."
JOJO RABBIT,9 May 2020,8/10,"While the main character of this film is ten years old, it is not a movie for children, being more in the tradition of Robert Benigni's 1997 film Life is Beautiful. The title character, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffith Davis) is a member of the Hitler Youth in a small town in 1944 Germany, but he is a miserable little Nazi. He earned his nickname when he refused to kill a rabbit during a training exercise and really screws up during grenade practice, being too close when the device goes off. He survives, but his face is scarred. He doesn't have friends, except for fat little Yorki (Archie Yates), so he conjures up an imaginary friend in the form of Adolt Hitler (Waiki Waititi, who also directed and wrote the screenplay). Then he finds that his mother (Scarlett Johansson, nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) is hiding a 15 year old Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. The local members of the Hitler Youth are commanded by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who lost an eye during combat earlier in the war, and he is assisted by Alfie Allen and Rebel Wilson, but they are essentially caricatures rather than characters. (Wilson's character even claims to have given birth to 18 blonde Aryans like herself.) The local head of the Gestapo, played by Stephen Merchant, reminded me of one of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, the script by Waititi won the Oscar in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Despite the subject matter, the film's purpose is satirical and it is actually quite funny at times. While it offers no new insights into the Nazis and is not all that original (Charlie Chaplin made The Great Dictator in 1940 and Mel Brooks The Producers in 1967), it is timely because of the recent rise of Anti-Semitism."
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"If you're like me and appreciate really great movies - don't miss this one! What cinematic creative treat! All I can say is 'Wow""."
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is an immaculately funny, engaging and heart-felt movie that is able to transcribe love amid its glorifying theme of Nazi Germany in World War II. Written and directed by Taiki Waititi, he did a fantastic job in telling this story in a humorous and twisty way.The movie follows the perspective of a 10-year-old boy in Hitler's youth, Johannes, who considers Hitler as his imaginary best friend. At Nazi camp, he is joyously exposed to dangerous German weapons. This later results in a grenade accident that made him stay back home with his mother, Rosie. Here, he discovers she is hiding a Jewish girl, whose name is Elsa, in their house. As a Hitler fanatic, he is urged to tell on her. However, afraid to jeopardize his mother's safety, he has to negotiate with her instead. Forced to spend time with Elsa, Jojo gets to know her a little bit. At first, Elsa hates Jojo and makes up facts about Jewish people. Naive 10-year-old Jojo believes all of this and proceeds to write a book about stereotypical Jewish traits viewed by the Nazis - hideous, scaly, horny and have evil superpowers to control people's mind.One of the funniest bits of the film is when a group of Gustapos visits Jojo at his house, they all say ""Heil Hitler"" to Jojo, and he says ""Heil Hitler"" back. This gets even better when Captain K. visits the house later, then they all have to salute again. I also like how everyone in the movie, especially children, acts as ""over-the-top"" Nazis proud to kill Jews or die for Hitler. By this, the film is able to satirize and capitalize on its depiction of the ridiculousness and ignorance of people living under Nazi rule in the 1940s.However, it also shows the side of more understanding and resistance under the system. Jojo's mother, Rosie, is an anti-Nazi herself; and Captain K., is sympathetic towards Jewish people. Ultimately, the movie speaks to one thing, that German people during this time period weren't evil sadists, they were simply so used to and brainwashed by all the Hitler propagandas. This movie effectively tells this through the perspective of children. Through Jojo's conversations with his friend Yorkie, he learns that Yorkie doesn't actually care about killing Jewish at all and was surprised that Jews are normal people who don't have horns and scales like textbooks say. This is perfectly expressed in Elsa's quote after Jojo tells her that he is a Nazi: ""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a ten-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club"". This theme is fulfillingly wrapped up at the end, when Jojo eventually changes his beliefs about Jewish people and kicks Adolf out of his mind.The illustration of love and relationships in the movie is also heart-warming and memorable. Jojo's arc mainly ties around two characters: Rosie and Elsa. We can see how close Rosie is to Jojo by her tying his shoes, going on bike rides, joking with him and imitating his father. Through the movie, Jojo gets closer and understands more about Elsa, so after feeling ""butterflies inside his stomach"", he has learned to sympathize and care for her. And in the time Jojo spends with his mother or Elsa, he finds love and forgets about his friend, Adolf.A use of symbolism that I love about the film is the rabbit. In the beginning of the movie, at Nazi camp, Jojo fails to kill a rabbit when he is asked to do so. He is humiliated and then mocked as 'Jojo Rabbit' by other campers for being a weaky. After consulting with his friend Adolf, he changes his mind and proudly adopts the image of ""a rabbit"" himself. As Imaginary Adolf says, a rabbit is quick and lean for survival and can hide when needed. This rabbit turns out to be Elsa at the end. She has been in hiding in so many houses and lives more than she would have under Nazi rule, but she still survives when the war ends. Jojo learns that the Allies win, but he is afraid to tell Elsa because after his mother, he would lose her too. But when he flips the page of the sketch book and imagines the image of a magician opening the cage to let out the rabbit, he knows that he has to set Elsa free. Like they say, ""If you love something, you have to let it go"".All of the actors did solid works for this film. Roman Davis Griffin did a fine job playing a young boy who is growing up confused and shaken by the challenges to his beliefs. Scarlett Johansson's performance goes on the spotlight, because she is exceptionally enchanting and loving as Jojo's mother but also a complicated character as an anti-nazi hiding a Jewish girl in Germany. Taiki Waititi as Imaginary Adolf is amazing, since he is absolutely childish and comical, that adds so much fun to the film by expressing the inner voice / state of mind of a ten-year-old. The only thing I wish more from the characters is for Thomasin MacKensie's Elsa to show more of her dynamics, as a Jewish in hiding for most of her adolescence, other than her love interest.Jojo Rabbit gets a solid 9/10 on my scale. Without a doubt, it is one of the best films of 2019. As a family movie, it shines on its own with hysterical and over-the-top comedy, and beautiful, heart-warming moments. It is an impeccable treat to watch and think about."
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit from Taika Waititi, the talented New Zealand director who brought us Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor: Ragnarok. This time, Taika used a new way to tell the WWII story, and this time via a boy Nazi's eyes to see this human tragedy. With Best Adapted Screenplay as the golden guarantee, Jojo Rabbit, without any doubts, should in your top 10 films of the year.In this film, labels are the key topic of the story. Without too many narratives about Nazi's offences, this film once has been criticized as may mislead the audiences about WWII and the true face of Nazi. However, in my opinion, WWII is just a background set, using this special time to discuss the key argument about humanity.Twentieth Century Fox Film
Jojo, a young boy who brought up by Nazi education, within that special environment, all the behaviour of him could be explained. But Jojo is just as same as other kids, no correct knowledge about the world or Jewish people. But in the deep of his heart, he knows what a right person's behaviour should do. Hurting innocent would definitely not on his list.If over criticised Jojo would not willing to hurt innocent, because of his age, that would be so wrong, as captain K, who I believe joined the force with no choice or finally realized the true face of the Nazi, what he has done on the battlefield is unforgivable, but saved Elsa's life and protect Jojo which need great courage cannot be forget (I do believe that Captain K knew the tragedy about Rosie then he realized that Jojo may in great danger.)Twentieth Century Fox Film
Take off their labels, Jew, Nazi and anti-fascism, I saw humanity will shine, in China, there is an old saying, ""There are no good or bad people, only good and bad behaviour. Having a conscience, even the most ordinary person could be a saint."""
JOJO RABBIT,6 July 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed the movie, lines was funny. Scenes was great too. Also a great anti-war movie. I would say good cinematography too.But at the end of film, things doesn't satisfy. It builds the all scenes but doesn't go anywhere.Fun to watch tho"
JOJO RABBIT,10 September 2020,10/10,A sweet story of a boy portrayed fantastically in a German war drama. Will give some laughs by the innocence of d child Nd sometimes tears of being lonely .English movie hadn't made me cry bt this one did
JOJO RABBIT,16 December 2019,10/10,"I can't really describe how fantastic this film is! And to think I judged it so harshly without even seeing it. The irony is that the film teaches us to stop doing exactly that. Judging without knowing. Hating without seeing. A beautiful lesson of love and learning and growing and acceptance. I laughed and cried and sat there until the credits ended. And I needed to pee. Absolutely one of the best feel good movies I've ever seen, beautifully acted, brilliantly directed, phenomenal script, I just can't praise it enough. The ONLY film I have seen this year that I could accept winning best picture instead of Joker. And if you only knew how much I love Joker you would know what a compliment that it for JoJo Rabbit. Incredible film, don't miss it!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2021,7/10,"This one was a fantastic movie that tackles the inner ridiculous nuances of the Nazi Germany at the time of World War II. A ten year old boy, growing up in the ocean of propaganda perpetuated by Hitler's war machine, fascinated by the Führer's charisma, willingly joins the youth program of the Nazi Party. Incidentally, his path crosses with that of a Jewish teenage girl. This leads to a heap of macabre events that unfurl entangling politics and racism.Both the child actors did great as protagonists while Scarlett Johansson's contribution was a cherry on top.It is a very likable movie, evident by the favorable score it received in IMDB. I would even go further and say this is one of the best movie to portray (and mock) the puerile concepts of the Nazis that led to the monstrous atrocities of the war to end all wars."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,9/10,"When I first saw the trailer I laughed but thought it would be another comedy with no plot and just crude jokes. However the film gave me a pleasant surprise in that it consisted of both comedy and serious drama and messages. Yes. This film may have worked without Hitler, however hitler was symbolic of how he was in the minds of boys at the time. Hilarious but also touching this film was."
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,10/10,"Funny. Premise, script, acting, everything in this movie is funny.
It is hard to believe that at some point halfway through the movie there is an event that makes you hold your breath for a few minutes like It does.
In this one Taika Waititi goes for a more Wes Anderson like directing and framing than I remember from his previous films, but you can tell he is behind the project beacuse of the humour It emantes.
Overall It was an absolute joy to watch and I would like to make an special mention for Scarlett Johansson who managed to bring to live a character that acts like 3 different people but yet feels real in this crazy universe.If you are fond of Taika Waititi's humour don't miss It."
JOJO RABBIT,20 October 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit was a very enjoyable and funny satire. I liked the acting especially from Taika Watiti, and the child actors did a surprisingly good job. I liked the directing and cinematography even though it was nothing exceptional. I thought the writing, dialogue, and script was good overall but again nothing exceptional. I liked the story, themes, and ideas explored in this film, but there were some aspects that didn't work for me. One of the biggest problem was the tone. For almost the entire film the tone is comedic but then sometime in the middle it just switches to completely serious out of nowhere and then just goes back to being comedic. Which causes the film to feel a bit jarring. There's also some emotional beats in the film that didn't work for me, since the film was comedic all the way up until that point I wasn't able to feel any of the emotions the film wanted me to feel. Not to mention the story and characters weren't developed enough to make these parts work which caused these moments to feel unearned and underdeveloped. But I still enjoyed it overall. I don't feel much of a desire to see it again and I don't understand why there's a lot of buzz surrounding this film. I would recommend this film despite some criticisms."
JOJO RABBIT,29 July 2020,6/10,"I wouldn't recommend the watch, the first half was weak and awkward, humor fell flat. A lot of the jokes were out of taste and hard to land given the serious theme they are attempting to lighten. The second half was more emotional though and actually a good watch. All in all I wouldn't recommend the watch unless you're curious."
JOJO RABBIT,17 August 2020,9/10,"Lets face it, JoJo Rabbit is a satire about one of the most dreadful periods of recent History. Many people are 'sensitive' about the WW2 era and believe that it is NOT a suitable subject for ridicule....or is it? The answer is YES, of course, if done in the right way. Many facets of the Third Reich ARE ridiculous and the film makes great play on the Nazi ideology, it's Racist and absurd beliefs and it's paranoia and utter control. Again, so-called 'Professional Film Critics' once again failed to get the point - many of them showing that they are not up to reviewing current films - any Critic that tries to compare this Film with Mel Brooke's 'The Producers' is not only lazy but WRONG. JoJo Rabbit delves into the very heart of what it meant to be a child in Nazi Germany - taught to believe in the Fuhrer and the ideology completely. The Film is not without it's dark side, which is entirely appropriate given the setting and the threat of the authorities is very real.
The Cast are all superb - especially the child actors - who bring their characters to life in a believable way. Johannson does a superb job as 'JoJo's Mother and Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf is a suitably war-weary Wehrmacht soldier.
This is a Film that satirises the utter madness of the Third Reich but does so in a way that will appeal to modern kids who can hardly credit that this really happened. It is also extremely emotional, as the various characters navigate their way towards a finale that is both sad - and uplifting...
Oh and Taika Waititi's 'Imaginary Hitler' is fun too!!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2019,8/10,"Described as a satire on hate. ""Jojo Rabbit"" follows a Hitler Youth who finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic. He must then question his beliefs, while dealing with the intervention of his imaginary friend, an idiotic version of Adolf Hitler.""Jojo Rabbit"" exceeded my expectations in both it's comedic pacing and gut-punching heart and reality. The blending of the two worked so well, which was heightened by the solid acting all around. Child acting can be very hit-or-miss, but both of our lead kids were fantastic! It also helps that Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo is literally one of the cutest child actors I've ever seen. I hope to see more from this kid soon! I find Scarlett Johansson to be very hit-or-miss as well, but this may be one of my favorite performances of hers to date. The chemistry shown between her and Jojo's character was so heartwarming and refreshing. The big reveal in the film completely blindsided me once I saw those shoes, I gasped out loud as did my friend next to me. That doesn't happen often. She did what she could.We got some Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen exchanged looks and sensual spoon feeding which was something I didn't think I'd ever see in film. But it was pretty great! We also cannot talk about this film without acknowledging the greatness that was Taika Waititi. He directed the film and wrote the screenplay. He also plays Hitler in this film and damn did he kill it. Him doing all of that just makes me respect him so much more as a creator. The film also looked great as well, wanted to mention that because it shouldn't be overlooked.The film is over the top and enjoyable. It will probably go on my list of favorites from this year. I still don't quite understand the unicorn meal Hitler was eating during one scene, but that's probably just me being dumb. I also questioned Jojo being allowed to live alone and what happened to his father. Though I could've missed that last bit. I hope audiences understand the film and appreciate it for what it is."
JOJO RABBIT,25 August 2020,,"This is a horrible movie and a terrifically fantastic movie all rolled into one.We were not sure what to expect. It seemed to be pure satire and comedy at the start then switched into a much more serious and violent story as it moved along.I decided, about halfway into the movie, that what we were seeing was WWII Germany through the eyes of a ten-year old boy, including his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler.Once I accepted that perspective, the movie made sense, and its sad reality became more apparent and heartrending.It is an extremely audacious statement of the NAZI and the war's horror, when shown through its filter of the eyes of a ten-year old boy. It is exceptionally creative.Great acting. The crazy mix of nuttiness in the midst of brutality is a mix of sugar and vinegar in the story telling.The actor playing Hitler deserves high marks for his zeal, and the mix of real Hitler speech and intensity merged with a little boy's personality."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"It's human nature to deal with horrible events (and people) by laughing at them - and this film does the best job of laughing at the Third Reich since Springtime for Hitler. The comedy is brilliant (who'd've thought you could get laughs out of people saying ""Heil Hitler""?) - but with an undercurrent of both biting satire and warm-heartedness. But it's not just a comedy. When **that** happens, the fact that the audience was completely unprepared for it gives it the impact of a physical blow. A superb performance from young Roman Griffin Davis as a child trying to make sense of a mad world. But is the **law** to include a comedy fat kid?"
JOJO RABBIT,4 March 2020,9/10,"This film is fresh, funny, and yet extremely moving. Few films endeavor to touch the entire spectrum of human emotion. This film succeeds in moving its audience from roaring laughter to bitter tears; from whimsy to edge-of-your-sear-suspense.
All performances are noteworthy but Scarlett stands out as the mother ""who stares tigers in the eye."" She plays the role with such conviction and ferocity. She brings to life such a realistic depiction of a woman caught in a war she hates, that's torn her family apart. Every single scene she is in, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This is easily my favorite role of Scarlett's."
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2021,6/10,"Although I liked the cinematography and the characters, I found it rather boring and not in the least funny.
Don't get me wrong, the writing is good, the acting is good, I just did not connect with this movie at all."
JOJO RABBIT,29 September 2021,9/10,"What can I say, Taika Watiti just keeps giving one banger after another.It's a film that takes you through a mockery of history, and yet you feel yourself living it. The style in which the Holocaust is touched, is, and I know it is a cliched adjective these days, but, a masterclass in itself.Johansson is a delight to look at, as always.Jojo Rabbit is easily amongst one of the best films of all times list."
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,9/10,"Without giving away too much of the plot this is a comedy like no other
The minor characters of Sam Rockwell and rebel Wilson are great"
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,6/10,"First of all, the acting performance of all the actors must be commended, especially the one who played the role of JoJo. In addition to the last actors and good directing and the environment in which the events take place. But I think the story was ok and very normal and does not deserve all this cheering, in addition to that there is no comedy that makes you laugh despite the fact that the movie is rated comedy and there is not even a black comedy.
A film that has more political goals than anything else"
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,6/10,"Ok that my title for it because i saw so many films talk about ww2 I did not see somthing like that you can have anything with this love, hatred, tragedy and comedy plus i like the lesson for these people who guided by wicked gadfathers."
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,10/10,"A great candidate and a challenging one for the title of 'Film Of The Year'. Honestly, this is a must-watch movie, and the reason is Taika Watiti, the man who reinvented Marvel's Thor franchise and because of him he became the first superhero in the MCU to have a quadrilogy. Seriously, every aspect is perfectly excuted, from the cinematography to the casting... Etc. However, let's stop for a few seconds in talk about the performances, Roman Griffin Davis, what a kid, amazing performance from a little boy who 💯 will have a bright future, I just can't wait to see him compete with Jacob Trembly for an Oscar in the future. Speaking of Oscars, this movie should at least be nominated for two or three ones, Best Picture, Best Male/Female Actor In A Supporting Role (Whether Scarlett Johansson. However, I don't think so because of Marriage Story. Or, Taika Watiti, yeah the director and the writer of the movie deserves to be nominated) and last but not least, Best Screenplay (Again Adolf Himself). Just Simply, WELL DONE."
JOJO RABBIT,8 October 2020,9/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
Good laughs but also good emotional pieces.
Also had a good underlying plot. Great performance too."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,10/10,"This is sumptuous cinema. It ticks every box. The direction is superb, the writing deeply hilarious and moving, the acting, especially from the remarkable young boy, is Oscar worthy. There were many kids at the session I saw this wonderful movie at and I wondered, gosh, how will they even get this?...it's such an anarchic treatment of the Nazi story and such a truly weird journey, will they hang in there until the end?. But they did. And they clearly got it. And they loved it from their reactions as they left the cinema.
I can't speak highly enough of this stunning film. Go see it!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,8/10,"B+
This film is hilarious although sometimes may have taken it a bit too far.
There were also several serious moments and the film cleverly showed the situations occurring.
Great writing and an excellent lead performance.
Overall a beautifully heartbreaking and heartwarming story and one of the best films of 2019!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,9/10,Lovely performance and heartwarming story and characters narration... great adaption... Nostalgic... childhood memories... Imaginative... Child perspectives... movie lovers must watch
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,9/10,"There's a paucity of original ideas in today's World Cinema. Perhaps it studio's trying to play it safe...Loved films spawn sequels that studio's consider a safe investment. Superhero films seem like the only other area studio's will invest in.Taika Waititi right now seems like a safe investment too.The Writer / Director penned one of the quirkiest most touching films of the Past decade.Set in Nazi Germany; Jojo Betzler is a bumbling enthusiastic member of the Hitler youth who's imaginary Best Friend is none other than the Furer himself. ""Adolf"" is hilariously played by Waititi himself.During the course of the story Jojo learns many life lessons. Waitiki interweaves drama and comedy in throughout to great effect thanks to a stellar cast. Sam Rockwell & Scarlett Johansson occupy pivotal roles. But there are some newcomers who make a good impression and other acting veterans with small star turns as well.You don't want to miss this one !"
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,10/10,This movie will make you laugh and cry. It is not just a satire on the herd mentality of people during the world war 2. It is about breaking barriers to feel the love. The actors have done an excellent job. Scarlett Johansson has given a great performance after Marriage Story. The kids in the movie are so much better than many grown up actors out there. The final 30 minutes prove that Taika Waititi can direct beautiful and heart touching movies. You should watch this. Critics are too harsh on this film. May be they are expecting a 1917-ish kind of film with child actors.
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2020,4/10,"Imma be that odd ball, I didn't realllly like it. It was fine but not a movie I would watch again. I thought rebel would have more screen time and more awkward moments. The trailer made it seem like it was the funniest thing out there,(it made me reallllllyyyy wanna see it!!!!!) beside the scene of the girl in hideout closet. It got boring in a lot of scenes. A lot of non-important moments, but I get it's to get to your emotions, (mom dancing with son, screaming at him pretending to be dad, mom talking to the girl, talking at the bridge). Kind of pointless. I didn't feel much feeling in those scenes. I get it's supposed to be semi humorous at the kid club but it seemed kinda stupid and embarrassing to watch, pointless moments in the clubs scenes. My mom who is the biggest ww1-ww2 movie fan that has to do with wars, I can speak for her-she was bored, kept dozing off and messing with her blanket. I pretty much knew it was a goner for her at around 7 minutes into the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,1/10,"How does this have an 8 rating in IMDb? Forget about the insensitivity regarding the subject matter - this movie is BORING. Not funny AT ALL. And I'm a fan of the writer for ""What We Do in the Shadows"" but none of that humor was here. Everything that is an attempt at humor is not funny in the slightest. The dullest movie I've ever seen. Disgusted and dumbfounded by the positive reviews and the nominations. I was curious to see how they'd make antisemitism and Nazism humorous, but they didn't. I was so bored I was texting people about how bored I was. It had zero entertainment value. This isn't a topic to make light of - how this has such a high user rating just highlights that people are blind to antisemitism. Would people laugh at a dark comedy about slavery in America? But it's OK to laugh at an insanely boring and unfunny film about antisemitism during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany? I feel sick."
JOJO RABBIT,20 October 2019,10/10,"If Scarlett and Sam don't get at least Golden Globes nominations for this film I'll be disappointed. I think this might be the best work Scarlett has ever done - she was animated, dynamic, and played her roll with impact. The kids in this film are amazing. It's perfectly written and has amazing perspective. The film is out-and-out BRILLIANT, and when it 'hits' it hits hard. It was perfect in every way. And the timing couldn't be more perfect. 10/10."
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2020,10/10,"Wow from start to finish it's brilliantly written ,cast, acted and directed and if you don't get goosebumps during the closing sequence then you're not human.The two main characters Elsa & Jo Jo are just perfect and the supporting characters are equally joyous,vulnerable,bewildered and menacing.This deserves to be a perennial Xmas film even though it's got nothing to do with XmasPerfect 10"
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2019,10/10,I found this movie and literally knew nothing. What drew me was the bright red logo for it and I thought itd be cool to just watch it knowing nothing. Thought it was a horror movie cause of the way the title was drawn. Just said JOJO RABBIT. Anyways I really like it so far and I'm 20 min in and paused it to see the reviews and I had no clue his mom was hiding someone. Like I'm actually mad you guys let that in the premise on the main page. Comeon. That would have been such a cool wowwww scene but no. Come on
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,6/10,"Good film with nice acting, beautiful cinematography and decent humour,Tho it's not great as Charlie Chaplin's dictator and it's still enjoyable"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,10/10,What a great film. So refreshing to see a film which is so different and so well made. There was nothing I could fault about this. It manages to combine some terrific lines and comedy moments with the pointless tragedy of war. One of the best films I´ve seen for a while.
JOJO RABBIT,14 March 2020,8/10,I loved how silly this movie was but at the same time the sad scenes are really touching. I mean the way the close up of Rosie's shoes was revealed was heartbreaking. Everyone was well cast and really played it well. With that being said we needed more Yorki; he was such an adorable character and was just going along with what everyone was telling him to do.
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,6/10,"From the point of view of the audience, this film has the feeling of standup comedy in the comedy effect, and the whole audience will naturally be praised by the public. In addition, the film is very rare that although the plot is relatively weak, but there is no vulgar and similar to the Jews and Nazis through the exchange of understanding and good bloody plot. The boy's transformation is handled delicately, which is one of the rare highlights of the film. This is not the first comedy to make fun of Nazi and Hitler Youth, but it is a good one because it doesn't force people to laugh with a fart plot."
JOJO RABBIT,12 April 2020,10/10,"This film was stunning, hilarious, moving, beautiful, and perfect. If I could give it an 11, I would. I don't even know what to say. I'm blown away. Thank you, Taika Waititi. Thank you."
JOJO RABBIT,20 December 2019,8/10,"I can't even imagine how difficult it was for Taika Waititi to get a film about a Hitler youth whos imaginary friend is Hitler greenlit. Kudos to him on that alone.
The amount of vision you have to have to make this film work is remarkable. It somehow manages to be both effectively hilarious and a grim depiction of Nazi Germany (how is that even a sentence I just wrote?).
My only criticism is that I wish we got to see more from Rosie before she was gone. Her loss was still effective as it was in the movie (the shot of her feet hanging stunned me), but it could have been even more affecting if we had gotten just a few more moments with her. Her last appearance was really just her walking away from Jojo, and then she was gone. If the film was an ode to single parents like Waititi says it is, that wasn't communicated that well, unfortunately
But it worked very well as both a coming of age story and a war drama, and the balance between humor and humanity was somehow perfect.
Lastly, I hope we see more of Roman Griffin Davis in the future. What an incredible young talent he is."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2021,3/10,"This was so bad, I was looking forward to the credits to seeing they were more entertaining."
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2020,9/10,This movie is laugh out loud funny. It is also cry out loud sad. It will make you want to hug someone and dance afterwards.
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,7/10,"Just like Life Is Beautiful this movie showed us 2nd WW time in a comical way...when Taika is the director you don't have to worry about the humor. The color and the cinematography of this movie are just brilliant ..Roman did a great job as the child who has Hitler as a imaginery friend and Taika as Hitler is superb..and obviously Sam Rockwell , whichever role he play done with the utmost perfection..such a brilliant actor..so, what I don't like then it is the 1st half of the movie...It is even for this type of movie feels very slow and the dialogues could be better...but the 2nd half is totally worth it..I say you should give it a try."
JOJO RABBIT,2 May 2020,7/10,"This was a film that i wasn't sure whether i wanted to watch when it was released on 1st January 2020, so i left it, until this week where all of a sudden i had an urge to see Taika Waititi's work.
So lets set the scene. This satire film is depicting the demised of the German fight in World War II in 1944. Now let me emphasise the word SATIRE. We are introduced to a boy, Johannes Betzler (Jojo for short) who is a 10 year old boy from a good German family. Jojo (played by Roman Griffin Davis) Idolises Adolf Hitler (who you see during the movie, played by Waititi himself). I believe that this was possibly common practice of a typical young German boy in those times. Whether that be through peer pressure or just the way they saw life. Jojo,s father we learn is absent and, ""in Italy"". So in effect Jojo is the man of the house and sees it his duty to be the man of the house, support him mom, Rosie (played by Scarlett Johansson) and support his ""hero"" and Fuhrer.
We see Jojo readying himself to go to a big weekend of ""fun"" at the Nazi Party Youth Organisation, this is similar to going off with the Scouts, or Girl Guides but with the madness of a satire look at how the Germans/Hitler would have ordered. By this i mean that the boys learn hand grenade throwing, camouflage and a whole host of other things while the girls will learn ""Womanly duties, like dressing wounds, making beds and learning how to make babies"". See comedy at its best! Once this is said by Captain K (played by Sam Rockwell) cut to Fraulein Rahn (played by Rebel Wilson), who for me delivers a laugh out load moment, she says ""I've had 18 kids for Germany, Its such a great year to be a girl"". (believe me her deliverance of this line is far better that i can just write down the words. Jojo's world gets turned upside down when he discovers that his mom has a Jew girl, Elsa (played by Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in their house. This is where the real story begins
I liked this movie and i thought that there were some good acting performances from Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie. I think they could have a really bright movie career ahead of them.
I have to mention one more thing before i go, as you know i do not give spoilers, please please look out for when Captain K has ordered defenses and has asked for the German Shepherds"
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is one of the funniest movies of the year, one of the most heartfelt movies of the year, and one of the most thought-provoking movies of the year. It was way better than 1917."
JOJO RABBIT,18 December 2020,7/10,"This is an unusual film - like Mel Brooks, Walt Disney, and Stephen King got together and decided to make a film. There is slapstick humor, tender moments, and some horror. I would say it is good satire and well done. When I was younger - 40 years ago - I would have given this an 8 or 9 - but now its a 7."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,10/10,"Yes, it's called satire, not historical drama. If you understand it, have a fulfilling life or don't take yourself seriously, there's no way you can't enjoy this film and what it is trying to achieve. It is sad that superhero movies will have a million 9 star ratings for the same tired old cliche, whereas an original, well executed film with actors who can actually act (even the kids, especially the kids in fact) can barely garner any press. This is an event that really happened, these are thoughts that really occurred, and it's only through honestly looking at situations like this can we improve humanity going forward."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,9/10,"New Zealand's Taika Waititi made a name for itself in 2017 with its MCU film ""Thor Ragnarok"", even if he was very busy in the film industry before. His humorous style was well received and I liked it too. Finally, a heart project of his came to the big screen: ""Jojo Rabbit"". Loosely based on the novel ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunen, Waititi shows a satirical but touching look at the end of the Second World War and the world of fascism. A film like ""Jojo Rabbit"" will certainly not please everyone, after all the topic is still anything but simple today, but I fell in love with this work, if I'm honest and can't wait to see this film again!Germany 1945: The end of the Second World War is imminent, but the Hitler Youth is still on the march. For little Johannes Betzler (Jojo), this is his biggest dream. His idol, who would have guessed it, is Adolf Hitler himself. So much so that he imagines the Führer as an imaginary friend ...As always, I take the view that one should go into the film without a trailer or a synopsis. The film is a satirical drama and I was a little disappointed afterwards that I saw the trailer because a lot of events are revealed. Of course, I will not do that here and try to be vague with the details of the story.""Jojo Rabbit"" primarily serves as a satire. An imaginary Hitler who is friends with Jojo? That sounds a little crazy, but it´s more complex than expect. This applies to a lot in the film. The often coarse but also astute humor in the film initially seemed out of place or too modern for me (at least in the beginning). And even if I would have liked to reduce it a tiny bit, Waititi's satire element works wonderfully in the context of Jojo and his view of Hitler & Co. It is much less about the Nazis and their shameful acts than about dealing with themselves, the subject of fascism and what it actually means. For Jojo, for example, it means being part of a gang, being part of something bigger, which certain books like ""Die Welle"" have shown wonderfully. But ""Jojo Rabbit"" takes a well-known (and unfortunately still very current) message and breathes fresh air into it. For me Waititi's humor and slapstick were neither disrespectful nor inappropriate, but clever and above all funny! Not every joke knocked me out of the chair, I was rather grinning more because the film came across so charmingly. And ""charming"" is such an appropriate word for me when it comes to this film!Because even despite the jokes, despite the satirical view of a terrifying time, in my eyes ""Jojo Rabbit"" creates a powerful statement about the war, fascism and its effects. There are moments that hit you completely unexpected, but that's exactly why they are so strong for me. A main reason why I liked the film so much.Let´s take a look at the cast: The little, talented Roman Griffin Davis makes his film debut and is just wonderful. Naive, energetic, but also soulful and adorable stubborn. He is the heart of the film and in my eyes deserves a lot of recognition. I didn't find his boyfriend Yorki (Archie Yates) quite as strong, even if he had funny moments. Scarlett Johansson is a charm and plays so lovingly and yet cheekily that it´s a pleasure to watch her. Sam Rockwell scores with a surprisingly multifaceted and funny figure, Stephen Merchant is great, like Alfie Allen and Taika Waititi himself (effectively and wittily) takes on the role of the imaginary leader. Rebel Wilson is also in the film, but she couldn't quite convince me. Luckily, her role is quite small.The film is beautifully shot, very colorful and powerful. Cameraman Mihai Malaimare Jr. supports the energy of the film with an equally energetic camera work. The soundtrack is great too. Michael Giacchino delivers a solid score and the song selection (large pop songs with German lyrics) is the final icing on the cake!Conclusion: ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a wonderful, over-the-top, but still ingenious film. It won't appeal to everyone, but it doesn't have to. Taika Waititi provides a funny, touching and, above all, charming view of a difficult topic. Something that many try, but rarely succeed in doing ..."
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,6/10,"Looking at the deformed world in the eyes of children, all kinds of contradictions seemed ridiculous and unreasonable. ""Marriage Story"" and this film completely let Scarlett get rid of the vase. The pure color interpretation of foreign little Baizhi also made people shine. Although the supporting role with the little follower is not too much, but there are also highlights. The essence of the tragicomedy may be just the right one ..."
JOJO RABBIT,26 August 2020,8/10,I love dramadies! Jojo is so funny and a wonderful story.
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,"Best film I've seen this year and one of the best I've ever seen. Waititi's previous work did not prepare me for the depth and beauty of this tale. Films rarely bring tears to my eyes, but this one did. That said, I laughed a lot as well.Several love stories, a riveting suspense story, an observation on the vulnerability and flexibility of young minds, a coming of age story, a tragedy and a hilarious and biting satire on hatred, in which love prevails, and more...The soundtrack is an economic use of great music, always perfectly placed. Two beautiful young protaganists with a fine ensemble cast of stars who are always absolutely brilliant. And an ACTUAL STORY! Which is becoming a rare thing in this post millenial era of film making.Now that he has entered the 'A' list I am really looking forward to Waititi's next film. I can't imagine how he would top this but given the extraordinary humour, depth and subtlety of this film I anticipate great things.And casting himself (a Maori man) as Hitler? CLASSIC!Not a film for the ""woke"" brigade!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,6/10,Jojo rabbit is a good movie. it starts of being a comedy but then it gets more serious. this movie is about a 10 year old learning the diffrence between what is right according to the majority and what is right from the heart.
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,10/10,The more I tried to understand. The deeper I fell in love with the characters. I laughed and cried. The master piece of this own kind. I loved it.
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,8/10,"Taika Waititi's latest creation delivers what i consider is a masterpiece. Incredible, fantastic and moving performances delivered by phenomenal actors on screen which will stay with u for a long time. The movie by no means try to preach or deliver a message. What it is trying is to bring about is foolishness of Nazism or Hitler. The movie in no way is trying to ridicule the atrocities of the second world war but it tries to ridicule the concept of hate or Nazism by the means of satire. Taika uses satire to tackle or visualizes the atrocities committed by Nazi. The best way to deal with grief is Satire...."
JOJO RABBIT,24 April 2020,9/10,"To start off, going into this movie I really did not expect it to be as good as it was. Based on the film's advertising and marketing one would think the film is a feel-good comedy movie. However, the film is less of a comedy film and more like a dark comedy dram or dramedy.
The film it self is about a German boy who is apart of the nazi party and his view on the war, current way of living, and view on the Jewish race. Keep in mind the film is being told from this child's perspective so if there is any thing that appears a bit too silly or out of place of the typical World War II movie this is why. There have been some reviewers that despise the movie for it not always being too serious but I believe this is the film's greatest strength.
In terms of the acting department this film would get a 10/10. The child actors Roman Griffin Davis in the lead role and actress Thomason McKenzie both give convincing and at times dramatic performances. The film also stars Scarlett Johansson( won best supporting actress) as Jojo's mother and praise goes to director Taika Waititi in portrayal of Adolf Hitler.
Lastly, the film in my opinion is good just for being so clever and original. The film somehow manages to be this thoughtful and sometimes shocking World War II film and balances it out with some comic relief. Luckily, the timing of the comic relief is just right not being to much or being too cheesy. Altogether, I highly recommend everyone go see Jojo rabbit with my score of 9/10."
JOJO RABBIT,18 September 2019,9/10,"Saw this after it won Peoples Choice award at TIFF. One of the perks for being a TIFF volunteer, a great deal of fun (volunteering at TIFF and this movie). I loved Sam Rockwell, Taika Waititi, the 2 young male leads and the whole story. It had me laughing from the beginning. It also contains a great message, we are all human and have real value. It had great pacing and was thoroughly entertaining. Congrats to everyone involved in this great project."
JOJO RABBIT,27 October 2019,10/10,"This was seriously the best movie I've seen in years. Don't let the ""woke"" left keep from seeing the movie. They have zero idea what the movie is about and why it was made. Just go out and see it. Thank me later."
JOJO RABBIT,25 March 2020,9/10,"A great example of a movie that has an agenda and knows how to get the point across without beating you in the head with it. That is rare in modern Hollywood. Funny, sad, powerful...Waititi is a genius. Watch this movie. Watch it now!"
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,10/10,"What a strange experience, I loved all of it yet I still can't quite put my finger on why, Stephen merchant is FANTASTIC"
JOJO RABBIT,18 April 2020,10/10,"Beautiful. Funny. Sad. Smart. Art.
And unfortunately, timely and relevant."
JOJO RABBIT,10 June 2020,9/10,"This movie in a really good way shows the only outcome of war: destruction and death of loved ones. This movie is a treasure and every US president should see it! Just to realize how many Syrian, Iranian, Palestinian, Yemeni and Afghani kids have died. The mistake Hitler made was to start a war, where negotiations could be done..."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,1/10,"Watching the trailer, I thought no, not interested. But then I read an article in the L.A. Times that put this up as a contender for best picture. So we went and wasted 90 minutes and $35. Don't make the same mistake.The story is very off-putting, and mixes genres (Satire? Comedy? Tragedy? Farce? Fantasy?) without doing any single one any justice. No, it's not funny. No, it has no message worth looking for. NoNo Rabbit would be a better title.You should know that the whole movie is shown through the eyes of children. This is almost never a good idea, unless the movie's creator is a genius, which this writer/director is not. Plus, the production quality is so poor that it looks like a couple of kids made it.With apologies to John Updike, I'd say Rabbit Run! Run away."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,10/10,"I'm not an English teacher but honestly, this movie would've been perfect for that symbolism lesson we had to sit through... anyway I scrolled past this movie in the Hoyts app purely based on the picture and title of the movie. Big mistake! This film was hilarious, moving, shocking, inspirational and everything in between. How a comedy/satire can pull on your heart strings blows my mind and this film does just that. One moment you're uncontrollably laughing and thinking ""did they really just go there""? The next, it's dead silence and you're left welling up. I know it's a cliche but this really is a roller coaster of emotions."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,9/10,"Thus begins the catching up on the Oscar bait films. I attended a Saturday night screening of Jojo Rabbit and I left having just gone through an emotional roller coaster that was not intended. From previous reviews, this movie just appeared to be a satire comedy, poking fun at the events of the second world war. However, I tell you, this movie is so much more than that. Sure the film ensures a few laughs and giggles, but this film really has heart and that's why I believe critics panned this movie, because the film does not know what genre or age group it is focused at.The film opens to Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), a German boy obsessed with Nazi Germany, pep-talking himself in the mirror of his bedroom as he prepares to be sent off to Hitler Youth Training Camp. He encounters Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), showcased as Jojo's imaginary friend and mentor. At the camp, Jojo is introduced to Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and Fräulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), as they teach him and his male peers to do simple tasks, such as murder and false propaganda of anti-semitism. Jojo is penalized for being frightened to murder a little bunny and runs off into the woods. He has a pep-talk with hitler and runs back, interrupting Klenzendorf's grenade launching class. Jojo accidentally throws a grenade at a tree, which bounces right back to his side. Jojo suffers major injuries including a large scar down his face and a limp. Klenzendorf sends Jojo home to be under house arrest for a few months.After making a bit of recovery, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), Jojo's mother, drops Jojo off at Klenzendorf's office, who has been demoted to office camp because of Jojo's accident. Rahm orders Jojo to do rather simple tasks such as hang up nazi propaganda across the town. As Rosie takes him home, they notice a public hanging in the town square. The next day, home alone, Jojo hears creaks in his house, which he narrows down to his elder sisters bedroom. He discovers that his mother had been hiding a young jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). Jojo threatens to call the gestapo, but Elsa reassures him, stating that if he were to note the authorities, then he and his mother would suffer for hiding her.That night, Jojo looks in disgust at his mother, acknowledging the fact that she has put the whole family in grave danger by having a jew in the house. Rosie notices this and offends Jojo, using ashes from the fireplace to create a makeshift beard, poking fun at Jojo's sexist father and states that she is in charge. Later, Rosie brings her dinner plate to Elsa, unaware that her and Jojo have already met. Daily, Jojo interrogates Elsa while Rosie is at work. Elsa gives Jojo false information about jews appearances and history. She claims she is engaged to a boy named Nathan. Jojo creates a makeshift letter in order to assure that she is frightful of him. After realizing what he has done, Jojo creates another letter, stating that everything in the first letter was false. One day, while doing work for Rahm, Jojo encounters his old mate Yorkie, whom is now a Nazi soldier. He bluntly tells Yorkie that he is hiding a jew, but Yorkie is too busy to focus. Jojo also encounters his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" slip of paper in town.A few days later, Jojo notices that Elsa is quite dirty and offers her his house's amenities, such as a bath and his mothers robe. The joy for Elsa is short-lived as the gestapo arrives at Jojo's door to investigate his house. Elsa runs upstairs but cannot find a way to re-enter the hiding place unheard by the gestapo. As they investigate, Klenzendorf arrives too. As the leading Gestapo officer (Stephen Merchant) notices that Jojo's safety pocketknife is missing from his uniform, Elsa appears holding the knife. Elsa tells the gestapo that he is Jojo's older sister Inge. Klenzendorf interrogates Elsa and sets her free. Once the policemen and Klenzendorf leave, Elsa breaks down, noticing that she gave the wrong birth date, but Klenzendorf let her go. As he is picking up scrap pieces of metal in the town square, Jojo sees Rosie's dead body having been hanged for her crimes.Jojo arrives back home, devastated and attempts to murder Elsa, but cannot find the strength to do it due to his affection for her. Elsa showcases mutual affection and comforts him, showing him the glimmer of hope she still has that the war will soon be over. A few days later, Jojo is wandering about town where he encounters Yorkie once more, who states that Hitler has committed suicide due to the allies closing in on Germany. Jojo refused to acknowledge this fact, until he sees explosions coming from fighter jets. The two boys run to hide, where they run in to Rahm, falsely promoting the little boy soldiers and tells them to shoot anyone that doesn't look German. She puts a makeshift coat on Jojo, and enters the battlefield with a bazooka, before she and the rest of the soldiers, minus Yorkie, perish from an explosion.The soviets find Jojo and pin him up against a wall, where he re-encounters Klenzendorf. Klenzendorf tells Jojo that his mother was good-hearted and he wanted to return the favour by saving Elsa. Klenzendorf does one final good deed and throws Jojo's coat off and calls him a jew. Jojo is put back onto the street as Klenzendorf is shot several times for his anti-Semitic behaviour. Jojo cannot seem to find the courage to tell Elsa that war is over, so she tells her that Germany won. Acknowledging her saddened outcome, Jojo recites another fake letter written from him in the perspective of Nathan. Elsa reveals that Nathan died a year prior from tuberculosis. Jojo finally confesses his love for Elsa, but Elsa states she only sees him as a younger brother. Hitler arrives one more time to confront Jojo, but Jojo throws him out of a window. Jojo tells Elsa the truth about the war outcome as the two head outside, as they dance together.Jojo Rabbit is a very sweet movie at its core. The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect score is the beginning chunk of the film. It feels quite elongated and unneeded as well as I believe there could have been more character development with Klenzendorf and Rahm, for I was basically calling them Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson during the films duration. I do think that Roman Griffin Davis has a bright career ahead, but the one who truly stood out to me in this film was Thomasin McKenzie. Although she is supposed to play a scared Jewish girl hiding in a German household, McKenzie showcases this strength and other side to this character that was quite cool.Overall, Jojo Rabbit gets a 9/10."
JOJO RABBIT,2 September 2020,10/10,"That's all you need to know. Brilliant.
Watch this film if it's the last thing you ever do.
That is all."
JOJO RABBIT,18 May 2020,10/10,"The darkness and ugliness of the war were exposed to the eyes of ten-year-old fanatics, and his mother let him see the only beauty and hope left in this crazy world. When living became a luxury, what a distant wish it was to be free to dance, but in the end they did it, they did it!This film contains laughs and tears. It is so rare to see a director would use such bright decor to set the film's tone.He certainly uses the method of Wes Anderson. And it gives the audience a very unique feel considered this is a film about World War II after all. It is light, but somehow you will feel something different inside your heart. This is definitely the warmest WWII film that I have ever seen.Great film for teenagers. Educational!"
JOJO RABBIT,27 August 2021,10/10,I thought this was gonna be a comedy but in reality it turned into a tragic story of a kid from Germany.
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,8/10,"I am an ardent fan of anyone who is prepared to hold a mirror up to racism, cruelty and persecution and harpoon these subjects with humour and ridicule. There is a rise in incidents of racism and intolerance and the president has raised the ""respectability"" of such behaviour. Jojo rabbit challenges so much of this using a gentle and absurdist satire. I know some critics think it doesn't go far enough, as in with The Producers (springtime for hitler), but I feel it does make some highly relevant points. Johanson is a joy as jojos courageous and resilient mother trying to show her son a different path than the hitler worshipping blind faith that jojo exhibits. The relationship between jojo and his best friend is incredibly sweet and touching, but it's jojos relationship with his imaginary friend hitler that is hilarious and at times difficult to watch, but provides some simple but compelling messages. It's definitely worth watching."
JOJO RABBIT,8 March 2020,10/10,What are you waiting for? You must see this movie!!!
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,I just watched it for the second time. I don't think it would be possible for me to love a movie any more than this one. That is all.
JOJO RABBIT,15 April 2020,9/10,"A warm and sad anti-war fairy tale.Scarlett johansson's costumes and hair were stunning, and Sam rockwell proved his acting chops with a few scenes.In addition, the music is also one of the highlights."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,5/10,"There has been a fair amount of buzz about this film for a while, i hadn't read any reviews so thought i'd check it out. I loved What We Do in the Shadows so what could go wrong? Well plenty really as illustrated here. Not very funny, not funny enough a satire that's for sure. I think it felt a little like the 10 1/2 yr old boy in the film wrote it himself. If youre going to turn Nazi's into a joke try make it a funny one. The story is just far too whimpering, not daring enough. Plenty of people on here are celebrating it and saying the critics got it wrong but i agree with the critics, its a bucket of drivel really. Such cheap tricks, young children meant to stare up our emotions, naive humour, no it doesn't work and sorry but the little boys acting is a bit cardboard, it feels like the director coached his comic lines and took the natural delivery away. Almost desperate to be a bit Wes Anderson which is equally as boring. I admit to enjoying a few moments but hell some tv adverts are slightly amusing, i still don't care for them though. I give it 5.5 stars out of 10. (Not quite bad enough for a 5 but a 6 makes is misleading)"
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,"I'm going to have to try very hard not to give too much away here, for reasons that will be clear to anyone who has already watched and loved this film, a wonderful and extremely timely satire on a dark, dark time in human history.Inevitably events took an ever more sinister turn as the story progressed, until the battle scene towards the end which, knowing how closely it echoed the real historical event, brought a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye.And then... quite possibly the most emotionally gut-wrenching final minute of a film that I've ever witnessed. The moment, and the song, for so many multi-layered reasons that echo through the decades, just broke me - and I say that as someone who hardly ever sheds a tear over books, TV shows or films.Please watch this film. You'll be the better for it, and maybe the world will be a little bit better too."
JOJO RABBIT,8 August 2020,10/10,"It starts off hot, get a little boring and slow for a bit, then gets better, and better and outrageously best! I've watched it three times so far and am still picking up things that I missed before. A combination of comedy, biography, horror and unique perfection. I knew before confirming that the people who created the awesome film, The Darjeeling Limited were involved in this masterpiece as well. The music was a dead giveaway. I'm a Scarlett Johansson fan and while her character was good, she was not great. The chubby little Archie Yates as Yorki stole the show as well as Sam Rockwell as Captain K., Perhaps the only likeable adult Nazi I've ever seen on screen. You're in for a real treat!"
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,10/10,Truly a good movie. Ending on David Bowie's Heroes was perfect.
JOJO RABBIT,27 November 2020,9/10,"It's an enjoyable movie that tells tragic history in the eyes of an innocent child. It's unique in its ability to share sadness and trauma yet still provide a source for laughter and entertainment. An enjoyable movie that reminds us to find the humanity, character, and humor in any situation... To live."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,1/10,"Disinformation about Nazis and propaganda movie. Even as entertainment, I did not find this movie funny at all. Like another reviewer mentioned, not enough to make it an emotional experience."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,3/10,"I usually enjoy satirical comedies, however I am always weary in the liberatory power of satire as it can often present as a double-edged sword. Take this film, for example. While I understand its fictitious narrative conveys the power of propaganda through the perspective of a child, it seems like this alone is the only reason why there are some who hold it in such a high regard. It is still a make believe representation. Ordinarily this is fine but for those who are inevitably gullible enough to take this satire as an accurate account of Nazi Germany I think it is potentially dangerous for it to play at devils advocate.The tonal mish-mash between comedic and tragic seems, I think misguided and isn't particularly funny given the subject matter. There was the odd bit of amusement but generally the story was quite dull, meandering unless your perspective is clouded by an idealisation of children's 'ways of knowing', to paraphrase the postmodern mindset."
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,8/10,"The critics were very hypersensitive and had a very closed mind when reviewing this movie.JoJo Rabbit is a satirical vision of the Second World War, when dealing with an issue like this in a satirical way you have to be very careful not to seem so insensitive, Waititi uses the necessary touch of satira and social issues to create a kind of criticizes to the neo-nazist movements and the use of the naivety of children to take him to political issues, Waititi knew how to get there and does not explore the theme of nazism in a deep and somber way, however the movie gives a heartbraking scene whose protagonist is the feet of Scarlett Johansson, incredibly Waititi created an emotional scene involving feet better than Tarantino.The film has a scene that involves the Nazi greeting that makes us laugh intelligently, that scene more than a criticism is a mockery, That no neo-nazi see this! Sincerely Waititi had never convinced me, however JoJo Rabbit is his best work Until now, Waititi cinema is full of satirical comedy and this film is its best and boldest demonstration, a sentimental story about the hate instilled in children irrationally, JoJo is a boy with little mind of his own and everything he knows It is practically things that his imaginary friend has put in his brain that turns out to be a child representation of Hitler, but it is obvious that this representation of Hitler is like that since it is the product of a child's mind and this reinforces more the naivety and JoJo's good heart."
JOJO RABBIT,22 April 2020,8/10,"Funny, sad; Absurd, true; Madness, civilization; When these pairs of opposites are shown in a movie at the same time, the movie becomes a reality. You think the world is all gray, but there is still love where you can't see it."
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2020,9/10,"The villain of history is the treasure mine that produces black humor. The absurd and funny lines are extremely evil. Under the light rhythm, the layout is the most powerful and stress. The witty and childlike and serious reality switch back and forth. The people who cry and laugh can't tell whether the keynote is happy or sad; mom and Captain K and other positive figures are very important. The core is actually the same as that of all World War II movies: hope and believe that justice will win in the end."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,8/10,Funny and emotional as well. Taking the story from a different angle. Liked it very much.
JOJO RABBIT,4 April 2020,9/10,"An amazing movie. It will jolt your soul, if you have one. A must see recommendation."
JOJO RABBIT,1 September 2021,10/10,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Jojo's arc is extremely well told amd extremely compelling. The acting is great!!!! The cinematography is great. The movie takes the smart route of not making fun of the holocaust or the war. The movie makes fun of the stupid racist nazi belief. If somebody is offended because a movie laughs at Nazis, I don't know what to tell them. The humour is great in my opinion! The characters are likable (except imaginary Hitler who's supposed to be hated). The movie's themes are wonderful! This is one of my favourite movies, for its strong humour, drama, characters, story, script and editing! A movie that will be remembered!!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,16 April 2020,9/10,"Great movie. My favourite of 2019 for sure. It's very funny and light, while also showing the darkness of the Second World War and the horribleness of it all."
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2020,8/10,"This may be the most tear jerking comedy of the year. Outstanding Comedy always has a sad core; outstanding tragedy always has the magic power to make you laugh in tears. It's not a novel way to start from the perspective of children, but this film still uses this method, with a childlike smile, to depict war so vividly and love so moving."
JOJO RABBIT,1 December 2021,9/10,"Taika Waititi's hilarious style of directing paired with great performances from himself, Sam Rockwell, Scarlet Johansson and others, culminates in this great movie, that does a great job of making fun of the WII era, while also not being overly offensive. When the movie needs to be funny it's hilarious and when the movie needs to be sad, it's heartbreaking. One of the best movies of 2019."
JOJO RABBIT,15 April 2020,8/10,"My understanding of the movie before I watched it, that it was a spoof on Nazi Germany. I was wrong, it was powerful, sad, funny.... It really brought emotions."
JOJO RABBIT,5 April 2020,6/10,"When i saw the trailer for this was not sure, but after watching it. Hitler is a joke character a lot like the one in the Producers.
But this is a clever film, bringing the Jewish girl into it, and showing that Jewish people don't have 2 heads, we are are blood and bone and all bled red. And as we are seeing in the world at the moment everyone from every race, colour, gender, is being taken by the evil Virus.
Roman Davis in his 1st role is stunning, and the rest of the cast are equally as good.
its a film that should be showed in schools all over the world, as its the best way i can think of to get rid of the disease of Anti-Semitism.
Must make special mention also to the brilliant writing and of course Thomasin McKenzie who is as good as Roman"
JOJO RABBIT,5 May 2020,10/10,This is so funny. Don't listen to the idiot PC police who would ban Tom Sawyer. This is a great movie in the same vein of Blazing saddles. This has so many laugh lines. I hope to see more like this and screw the PC idiots.
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,4/10,"While I was looking forward to it I am thoroughly disappointed and even kind of disgusted. A few cheeky and o. k. jokes, a clear Wes Anderson influence gone wrong, an attempt to use classic rock to elevate it and a metaphor of indoctrination that would attempt to justify it as some kind of heartfelt effort but in the end everything that is wrong about liberals this day and age... The actual history of child use in Nazi Germany is a horror, inhuman, beyond what people think anyone could be capeble of, a real insight into the terror humans can achieve and it really happened... Hitler Youth was not some sort of American Eagle Scout camp where it's members lived in happy 21st century, middle-class, political correct kinds of homes. In its attempt Jojo Rabbit actually sanitizes the worse of truth and while I came in wanting to like it because I'm a sucker for satire and comedies, I ended up wondering what the hell is wrong with Hollywood's liberal culture? patronizing, boiled down, censored, cowardly, self-confused, sluggish, uninformed... I know that not all movies should be Tarkovsky but watch Ivan's Childhood, Rossellini's Germany Year Zero, Elem Kilmov's Come and See ... if you have a thesis don't take it half way, go the entire distance and don't pretend the film is something it's not... this is not even close to Strangelove, To Be or Not to Be, The Great Dictator, Stalag 17."
JOJO RABBIT,3 September 2020,10/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a huge paradox of a film: it is simultaneously a film about Nazis, Jews, motherhood, childhood, political satire, screwball comedy, tragedy and triumph, all filtered through the perspective of a 10 year boy in the Hitler Youth, whose imaginary friend is the fuehrer himself. It is funny, heartbreaking, sweet and ultimately uplifting. All the actors are at the top of their game, with Roman Griffin Davis as the center that holds. His relationship with Scarlett Johansson is the heart of the movie. I know it's a cliche to say, ""You'll laugh; you'll cry,"" but if you don't, there is something wrong with your heart."
JOJO RABBIT,22 September 2021,9/10,"Was it a comedy? Was it a drama? Was it a fantasy? Idfk but it was incredible. The acting, the casting, the story, the jokes, the tragedies. This movie had everything. HIGHLY recommend a watch."
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2020,8/10,A little boy who is a fanatic of nazis. Lives in a fantasy world with their leader. Quite fascinating performance by all the child actors. hillarious movie one of the best in the year
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,8/10,"The first part of the movie seems odd and disturbing.
However as the movie moves on it gets more interesting. The character arc was well thought out and the diversity thing that Hollywood is raving about is well inserted and not too awkward. Jojo's German accent is sometimes sounds like British accent. That sometimes puts me off but understandably so for a young actor. Taika Waititi did and amazing job and will definitely recommend this movie to all the people I know."
JOJO RABBIT,20 April 2020,1/10,"This movie is just a bad parody, the only things I like about it are the jewish girl and her clothes."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,8/10,"Although this movie is set during WW2, its message is universal, and there are a lot of parallels with the current political climate as well: the blind faith in ""strong"", corrupt leaders and their stupid ideals, the indoctrination of kids with propaganda, the rage and hate towards certain groups of people and cultures due to sheer ignorance, cognitive dissonance, and so on. It's a cautionary tale about how you shouldn't allow yourself to be a pawn in this game, because in the end reality always comes crashing in, and it's never pleasant.Although it has its flaws, Jojo Rabbit is a pretty good effort from Taika Waititi. The writing is spot on. It's funny and very moving at times. Don't expect it to be a full-on comedy though, like those reviewers who gave it 1 star because they didn't laugh enough. Talking about ignorance..."
JOJO RABBIT,13 November 2019,10/10,"I expected to see a heavy handed sarcastic comedy.Instead, beneath the hilarious mocking of Nazi evil pretentiousness, There is a sweet, profound and deeply human story.Presented, in a big way, with excellent acting and directing."
JOJO RABBIT,14 June 2021,10/10,"This movie takes you on a roller coaster of emotions.Never is there a dull moment in any scene. The mixture of romcom and drama is perfect. The script itself is marvellous, and the characters are portrayed perfectly.Its a great watch."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,10/10,"Omg what a beautiful movie...
I'm so happy that I watch this beautiful movie.."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,6/10,"Interesting story yet quite a confusing narrative. Comedic efforts made sacrificed character development, created scenes of unknown significance, lessened emotional impact, and made earnest scenes seem out of tune, with the wonderful performance by Jojo luckily saving the day. Character transformation seemed fairly unreasonable. All in all a hollow film with minimal comedic value remaining."
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,10/10,"Faultless. Superb acting by the entire A-list cast. Exceptional writing and direction, beautiful camerawork, archival material used to enormous visual storytelling effect.
I loved every minute"
JOJO RABBIT,24 March 2020,10/10,"It was a really fun movie,
A very beautiful show, you feel loved, thank you to the actors thank you to the director"
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2020,9/10,"""And it is up to you to decide if you want to be remembered, or disappear without a trace, like a pitiful grain of sand into a desert of insignificance. To put it plainly. Get your s**t together and sort out your priorities."" 🦋Who else but Hollywood's self-proclaimed ""Polynesian Jew"" to blend such an audacious concept, serious subject matter and whimsical nature into a rousing Academy Award winning-success? Carefully balancing cutting satire with a sentimental coming-of-age story, the WWII fairy tale is sharp, quirky and pulls few punches, taking audiences from fits of uncontrollable laughter to tear-jerking sequences and everything in between. Making a mockery of the Nazis in 2019 is still a bold decision, and frightening when compared to contemporary politics, plus several jarring tonal shifts can catch unsuspecting viewers off-guard, so be sure to have a tissue or two handy. At the film's heart is its stellar cast and gorgeous production design, injecting every scene with playful exchanges and a light-hearted tone, like our leading couple and future stars Roman Griffin Davis and Thomas McKenzie, heavy hitters Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson, but best of all is the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who's sure to have a place in the on-screen Hitler Youth hall of fame."
JOJO RABBIT,1 May 2021,7/10,"Jo Jo Rabbit is a pretty good film. It has great acting, good cinematography, characters you can easily get attached to, etc. If you like sad, heartwarming though comedic films and don't get offended easily, I advise you watch this film; you will love it. However, if you are an action lover, are german, or are sensitive to '' dark humor'', I recommend you to not watch this film. There are many offensive jokes, there isn't much action, and the film portrays the germans as fools."
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,8/10,"Taika Waititi really is an odball. Some people hate him, some people love him, most don't even know what to think of him. For me, he's a director I always kept an eye on. His basic, silly humor was exactly my kind of thing, the canvas he painted it on... not so much. So when I heard he was working on a film revolving around the third Reich, it sounded like a great opportunity to finally put all that witful but weird humor to good use.And it certainly was. 'Jojo Rabbit' is full of incredibly satisfying dark goofy moments. A satire they called it. Can't say it is. Taika tackles the nazi regime and the holocaust too lightly and the criticism isn't poignant enough to tag it as such. 'He falls short', said the critics, 'he is not bold enough'. Probably right. But the result of Taika's tameness is a wonderful comedy drama enjoyable by parents and children alike. Because a comedy it is and a comedy it remains, for the most part. But when the plot develops and the drama strikes, 'Jojo Rabbit' turns into the most heart-warming and at the same time heart-wrenching film of recent years.Content aside little is there to say about Taika's last work, and all of it good. The directing is magisterial, with a perfect pace and visuals that make it hard to remember you're not watching one of Wes Anderson's masterpieces. And the cast shines so much on the screen as it did as a list of names on the title's credits. One after another, they all bring all their best into the table, regardless the importance of the role. That makes even more unbelievable the fact that a twelve year old newcomer could come and take advantage of playing the leading role to outshine a whole cast of acting titans. Roman Griffin Davis interacts with virtually every other character on the show, and his chemistry with every one of them is truly mesmerizing.In a generally weak year for cinema there's no doubt that alongside Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' and Todd Phillips' 'Joker', 'Jojo Rabbit' is one of 2019's crown jewels. But while the sooner stands out for its beautiful cinematography and its almost flawless original script and the latter relies too much on Joaquin Phoenix's stellar performance, Taika's odd dark nazi comedy might be the most solid overall of the three."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,JoJo Rabbit is probably the 2nd most controversial film in the Best Picture Nominees but it's still great. Roman Griffen Davis gives a great underrated performance and Scarlett gives maybe her best this year. Taika gives a good funny Performance playing Hitler. (So weird to say). JoJo Rabbit is a roller coaster ride of emotions. You could be laughing at all the jokes then all of a sudden in tears. Has such a great story and message to anyone who sees this movie. Oh and Sam Rockwell is great. The costume designs are also great as we see them from the perspective from JoJo. Overall it's a great watch and would definitely recommend.
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,8/10,"This is a truly wonderful film. It has everything. It is comical, it is sad, it is beautifully acted with a fabulous story, clever dialogue and an absolutely stellar cast. Roman Griffin Davis you were stupendous in this young man! Well done.Just watch it :)"
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,9/10,"Thomasin Mackenzie, she flips the narrative of what we think a Jewish child refugee should be."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit's wit and heartwarming message come together to form a fantastic film. Taika Waititi, while playing (an imaginary and flamboyant) Adolf Hitler, uses Jojo Rabbit to look at the indoctrination of the emotionally vulnerable and what can be done to save them. Encapsulating this message are legitimately hilarious moments, deconstructions, and political satire. With such a sensitive subject matter, any attempt at comedy needs to have a point and needs to actually be funny; Jojo Rabbit sticks the landing."
JOJO RABBIT,12 August 2020,7/10,"Outstanding comedy, always have a sad core; A great tragedy always has the power to make you laugh in your tears.It's not a novel way to start from a child's perspective, but this movie still uses this method, with a childlike smile, to naturally portray war so realistically and portray love so moving."
JOJO RABBIT,11 October 2020,2/10,"Uhhh yeah, I just don't get the ""rave"" reviews. Some things just arent meant to be made fun of. This movie is not for me. Throw it onto the pile with Cuties... for the leftists and socialists to enjoy."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,2/10,"Watched the first 45 minutes thinking it must get better with all these 10/10 reviews, but it didn't. Clearly I'm not the right demographic as I was hoping for something that would entertain me and make me laugh. This did neither. Gave up on it in case there was grass growing or paint drying somewhere that I was missing out on. Booooooooring!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,9/10,"*I don't know why but my review was severely edited by imdb. They removed all my experience with recent antisemitism and how hearing the antisemitism was difficult to hear* It is all necessary to make the story complete. Jojo being indoctrinated at a young age into Hitler youth and not realizing how ridiculous those ideas really are until he learns for himself that, yes, Jewish people ARE PEOPLE TOO! It was heartbreaking and funny all at the same time.
Hitler as his imaginary friend was absurd to me at first, but this is through the eyes of a young boy. Things are all fun and games until the horrors of war really hits home. Having Jojo realize hating people for no reason is wrong and that the one person he has left in his life is the one person he was brought up to hate and kill was very beautiful.It felt influenced by Wes Anderson, who I like a lot.It left me in tears at the end."
JOJO RABBIT,14 October 2020,8/10,"Very good , very funny ,a lot of paradies , a jew playing a nazy mother who is a secret jew helper, a littel make in Nazi, a tipical Jewish girl.
A kiwi director."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,7/10,"When I approached to see it I was feeling cranky that I had to stomach another Hitler movie, which it is, but it's also a parodie, the hero is a 10 year old boy who's character is brilliantly portrayed by Roman Griffin Davis, who try to deal with his nazi brainwashed being and love. You cannot laugh never at this kind of parodies, after all is another story, probably true, but you can smile and in the end feel relieved. Good cast, it give a glimpse in the world of general psychopathy of a nation under regime, where everybody has to act the role or being killed, but most of all, when children are used to destroy as weapon, the director master the absurdity of the horror into a fine amusement, Hopefully to let hatred knows how good a satire they can be.
And after all is a story that, despite being another hazy regime story, must be told, again, especially now."
JOJO RABBIT,9 October 2020,9/10,"I really don't understand the negative reviews, but to each his own.
I will say pls. watch this with an open mind, this is a satire after all, and an excellent one at that.I don't think it's meant to give you an accurate depiction of all the horrors of hitler/nazi and that time. This is not another Schindler's List and it's not trying to be.
And for me, this movie didn't minimize the horror either.What it did though, is to make me feel the horror in a more subtle, restrained way, but equally heartbreaking. More so, because I was feeling light one moment, maybe even smiling, then in the next moment I was overcome with unbearable sadness.By the end, I didn't quite know what I was feeling, it was several emotions all at once. And that's exactly how I wanted it to be. Real. Bittersweet.The parting words at the end moved me to tears. It was perfectly placed.I applaud this movie for being brave & brilliant, and having a lot of heart.
Experiencing this through the eyes of a child made it very endearing and deeply moving.Do yourself a favor and watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,16 December 2019,10/10,"I seldom want to watch a movie again, without quite a bit of time passing between viewings. But after seeing this yesterday, I want to watch it again very, very soon. I loved every minute of it and I also missed quite a lot of the dialogue because the audience were laughing so much - two good reasons to see it again.I would say that this is a ""black comedy"" with the quirky humour one has come to expect of Waititi, but there were also very sad and poignant moments, plus wonderful music taken from the soundtrack of my life (albeit the German versions).I think all the actors gave wonderful performances but I was pleasantly surprised by Scarlett Johansson (Rosie, the mother). I thought she was better in this movie than in anything else I have seen her in. Roman Griffin Davis (JoJo) was also great. At times he seemed to try a German accent and didn't quite pull it off, but that was a minor peeve. As Archie Yates (Yorki) and others did, I reckon he could have just not bothered with the accent.This review is going to be way too long if I say something about all the performances, so I will end off now by saying simply, ""Go see it for yourself!"""
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,9/10,Ya this is as good as Life Is Beautiful but funnier i think.
JOJO RABBIT,26 June 2020,8/10,"I don't think this film downplays the dangers or crimes of fascism, Nazism, racism, and all the other isms that plague society, but it does point them out to be as absurd as they are. If we always display Nazis and fascists as powerful and dangerous we may be perpetuating their desires, and giving into the way they wish to be perceived. Maybe Hitler was a pathetic little man that wanted to be powerful and adored. Maybe teaching children that people that are different from them aren't human is utterly ridiculous. To be able to laugh about it isn't denying how terrible it is, it is a way of dismantling the fear and power of it, and I think we need more of that today. I'm probably a sucker and will always believe that love and humor can overcome hate.Of the film: I laughed, I cried, I left it feeling wounded and introspective, yet hopeful! It presents WW2 Berlin from a boy's perspective, as a bright and colorful place whose optimism is being tainted by something fearful. Worth watching if you feel down about the world today."
JOJO RABBIT,3 March 2020,9/10,"Weird , funny , Heart warming and heart breaking . Great performance of scarlet Johnson."
JOJO RABBIT,29 July 2020,7/10,"The film is about children, but it is more like a placebo for adults to find a simple explanation for complex and profound social problems.There are some touching and lovely places, but they are more like formulas in sets.And if we really show the children, the crucial question of why the Nazis came into being, and the connection to the current society, seems to be avoided.The overall feeling is another Green book."
JOJO RABBIT,26 May 2020,7/10,"This is a movie about people. Of course, it is about identity, war, love and romance, but at the root of it, when we pay attention to what the war has done to the world, we often neglect that people are the main body of action.Despite the labels of race, gender, clothing, language, people stand together, there is no difference and thus equality. Regardless of the height of the ugly, the victims are not all weak, and of course, the women are not. The mother can put the captain on one foot, and the Jewish girl can quickly subdue Qiao Qiaotu. The Jews can pretend to be the Aryans to save themselves, and the Aryans can survive by being mistaken for the Jews. In addition to being brave, they also need humanity.Scarlett 's mother played a gentle role in the war film. She could be brave for her son and worried about her son being an activist, but she never forced him to make a choice or stop her. As a mother, she hopes that her remaining children can grow up healthily. And she also had an influence on the Elsa she saved. She gave her hope and considered it for her. Of course, if a choice had to be made, she knew very well that among Jewish girls who were ""like their own daughters"" and sons who were crazy about Nazis In the meantime, what choice she would make, but she also told Elsa frankly.The girl in the cupboard can do very little, but Rosie gave her a lot of imagination, being a free woman can do much more than the trained ""laundry, cooking, pregnancy"", you can go Morocco, you can learn to shoot, you can trust, you can be tolerant.These ""capabilities"" include specific qualities, being brave, firm, strong, gentle, and full of love. But these are things that Joe Joe understood later, his mother's shoelaces are his ties, he has to learn to take care of his shoes,Become a ""rabbit"" running around to protect the family. The rabbit is cunning, timid, and good at escape, but it does not mean weakness, and when he holds the key to lock another rabbit, he cannot be a selfish ten-year-old boy.In fact, he bears much more than the ordinary ten-year-old boy. The friendship between Jojo and York is moving, one is naive, the other is that even if the war is cruel, they have a passion for becoming a Nazi, but they still treat each other. absolute sincerity. Even if the war spawned the mind and became a chatter, the child's innocence is still there, allowing the audience to see the corner of humanity.The captain and mother worked hard to achieve peace in the way of adults. Rosie opposed the war, but did not evade reality. She rescued Elsa but looked squarely at the corpse until she became one of them. The captain saved Jojo quietly twice. He came from the battlefield, lost one eye, and designed himself the ultimate battle armor and matching makeup for himself. On the battlefield, he did whatever he could. He didn't want to bring these teenagers into the battlefield, but he also guided a teenager to protect his ""sister"". He said that Rosie was a really good person, and he meant that he was not a really good person. In the face of war, no one seems to be alone.Hitler was portrayed as an obsessive imaginary friend. He ate unicorns at home and did not shy away from his bloodthirsty, bringing passion to Jojo and relying on his enthusiasm for himself. When Qiao Qiao's attitude towards him gradually receded, he behaved like a forgotten game machine. Eventually, when Qiao Qiao learned that Hitler himself had a headshot, Hitler appeared again and became angry, with blood on his forehead. He behaved like he was forced to break up, hysterically, trying to prove Jojo's loyalty again with the 4D badge.It is said that the light of human nature is too great, and it is probably that even in the most difficult times, it is still firm and longing for freedom and beauty. This is the most moving place of this film.The Jews and the Nazis cannot be good friends, but is Joe Joe a Nazi? If he is not, then the lieutenant is always a Nazi. But in fact, this kind of segmentation is not so important. It is also the director's intention to change other clothes to pretend to be other identities, weaken racial identity, and emphasize the common identity tool of ""person"". Born to be human, why not hurt each other, please be romantic.""What's the first thing you 'll do when you 're free?"" ""Dance"""
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,8/10,"The films doesn't celebrate nazism any more than Indiana Jones does. It's escapism and it's done for comedic effect like Monty Python and many other films have done before with the crusades etc. It's almost a kids movie with a few laughs. I don't think the death of one of the characters was really explained properly though. If you are happy to separate the film from the horrors of reality then you will probably enjoy it. Hollywood asks you to do this all the time for murder investigation films, violent action films, comedy films. These films don't get marked down because people ""could"" find them offensive. Viewers are conditioned all the time to accept things in films that wouldn't be excepted in real life. JoJo Rabbit is an extension of that. Nobody ever said it's supposed to be real. I applaud Scarlett Johansson for taking the role."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2021,10/10,"Simple... Soothing... Lovable...
Everything is just perfect. Watched with my 9 year old daughter and we both enjoyed a lot..."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,9/10,"It's an excellent film in every single aspect that you can think of.
It's humour, acting, message, production values, screenplay, directing, score...I actually fell in love with it.
To me, Jojo Rabbit is one of the best films ever made!The balance in this film was fantastic and I can say I enjoyed almost every minute of it.Hatred (Esp. in a blind way!), love, passion, war, xenophobia, racism, humour, imagination, childhood, maturity and politics were among the numerous themes you can find in this masterpiece.I think we're all need to be more cautious about other films done by Taika Waititi after this!9/10"
JOJO RABBIT,6 April 2020,7/10,"Through the naive gaze of a 10-year-old boy, Taika Waititi tells us the key moment of ""Awareness"" of a society that has been suffering the consequences with pain for years, for having given their unconditional support to a leader, who is on the verge of debacle, through an interesting story located in Germany at the end of World War II.
Film that shows how influential society is due to age, socioeconomic status or ignorance and how easy it is to be able to manipulate it. Which points out the tricky methods of induction and promotion, through false nationalism, of exalting self-pride, of promising even the impossible, of making you see yourself as the Messiah, of idealizing yourself as the Savior of your people: Populism.
The New Zealand director makes it clear in Jojo Rabbit that the way to open your eyes, 'kick' the false illusion and realize reality, is through love and not hate. Accept us all as we are, regardless of physical conditions, races or religions.
In a burlesque and repetitive way, the author offers a couple of scenes, underlining the ridiculousness of the greeting to his leader, extolling praise, total dedication and unquestioning submission to him.
Comedy with a satirical tone, which although it has some good ideas, does not manage to go beyond the anecdotal level of the plot in order to turn it into a great film.
The ideas: In a movie that is located in a time of war, it is a very good idea to start with:
""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" by The Beatles to set the tone for the film's parody. It's also a great idea, concluding with ""Heroes"" by David Bowie rounding out the message of the film, with phrases from the song: ""We Can Be Heroes, Just For One Day""
Bad idea: using slow motion, trying without success, to give a poetic touch to a satirical-political comedy. Performances include: Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell"
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,10/10,"The movie was hilarious at the right time , emotional all the way , frightening at times and finally ends with a dance of freedom!
The movie revolves around a young 10 year old , who imagines talking to hilter and aspires to be in the nazi army. But he happens to find a young Jewish girl in his home.The movie will make you ponder upon on several scenes and ultimately makes you realise how cruel was the nazi regime in a uniquely satirical way!!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"Taika has solidified himself as a real master of comedy. This film has moments that hark back to Monty Python's style comedy. Every actor brings their A-game, especially Roman Griffin Davis! What a surprise!! I feel like this film will be similar to Life of Brian, in that it was a risky subject matter, but will stand the test of time as a cult classic. Everyone should see this film."
JOJO RABBIT,28 November 2020,6/10,After hearing so many say how brilliant this film was I paid to view . For me it felt a bit flat and didn't quite Gell . For me the comedy wasn't as subtle or savage as I would have liked . The pathos a bit too schmaltzy . It felt like Disney making a comedy whereas I would have preferred Black Mirror . 6/10
JOJO RABBIT,3 June 2020,9/10,"So far, I thought the King of War Satires was the Catch-22 ... I maintain that, and I don't.
Because in book terms it is still that, in terms of film, the Jojo Rabbit out performs. No, he doesn't surpass, he'd rather be on a par with him and Chaplin's eternal Dictator.
This movie is such that you can't know what, coming later, there's a cliché-like situation you're waiting for a cliché reaction to.
But it's not coming. But instead of something tear-jerking or something grotesque, because this movie is indeed grotesque.
In the way the Nazis are portrayed, in the way they behave.
And here comes the scene Johannes Betzler (Jojo), a ten-year-old Nazi fanatical little guy who thinks what the others do. The film already shoots early on that Jojo's mother, geniusly played by Scarlett Johansson, hides a Jewish girl in their house.
The film is really about Jojo and Elsa about the relationship between the Jewish girl. How a little boy undresses the prejudices he chews into his mouth, and deep down he doesn't believe it, just shows it.
No one here is what he shows himself to be, all for the sake of survival. Either referring to Elsa's little secretary or Frau Betzler's views.
The film is fantastic as the script is as visual as it is.
In the script, each word has a meaning in terms of the story, or at least refers in advance to something that only becomes apparent later.
The cameraman plays with symbols that we know only through the textbook.
The editing of the film is also well scheduled, there are no frames that would not be unnecessary.
The characters are also very well hit. Starting with the chubby woman of romantic comedies, Rebel Wilson, who, compared to her characters so far, would make us tear with her lyrics rather than her play (her stature). He always and in every situation sticks to a personal example at best, but that doesn't interest the dog, and that makes his figure as funny, as blinded to the Nazis as the other adults, but much smarter than them.Sam Rockwell's character Herr K, if he had lived, would surely have been Hitler's favorite.
A true bloody Nazi who is one of the sons, so much so that he designs for himself an ornamental uniformist for the victorious battle. Sam Rockwell brings the figure brilliantly. Every character thinks about him, he's the best and he just considers himself that. There are also paternal feelings swirling in him that he expresses toward Jojo, though not a typical paternal figure.
If you're already a parent figure, Scarlett Johannson will be competing for the Oscar as the female lead and supporting character with two mother characters, and with this film she's in her pocket for that particular prize...
Scarlett flashes the serene side of motherhood, which in a situation like II. world war, quite important, especially for his son.The humor of the film is not a bug at all, but is so whimsical, full of cinematic and pop cultural pictorial references. I'm not saying anything about it, just that it's always in original language like English beats, especially if there's a visual joke next to it.
The film is definitely human, it's mostly child actors, and to see the aforementioned Johansson character best, their mindset is completely different from the other characters.
The figure of Frau Beltzer, it represents the purity that every little child has. I can't praise Waiti's screenplay enough times where, for both female characters and kids, there's room for the play, not just background dancers, or the romantic thread, and the jokes are drawn to the film.The film features several quoted texts that have a very message. Such is Elsa's sentence in the trailer, ""You're not a Nazi Jojo. He's just a ten-year-old boy who likes to wear a funny costume and wants to belong somewhere. "" This is the sentence used to describe the figure of little Jojo.Roman Griffin Davis, as the title character, is a promising new talent among children's actors and could make him another good character actor.Overall, this is the film of the month and / or the year of the year in terms of film, comedy and satire, I think. Not to be missed. It is not a thought-provoking work, it can be talked about in retrospect.
Simply captivating. If I were to score, I would give him a 9, but only because of the predecessors mentioned above."
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,8/10,"This film Jojo Rabbit is very different from the films made about it, putting the audience into different emotions. The film's tints are so befitting the emotions they want to give, I think that's one of the things that complements the film. In addition, there are many emotions in the film.
The acting that the child actor showed really made the film a success in a very easy way. It's a very cute movie that people of all ages can watch."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,I have never seen a film that balanced insane parody comedy and drama this well. This is a masterpiece and will be remembered as a classic. This is subject material that has never been explored in this way. Only Taika Watiti could make Hitler funny and put a whole new perspective for Western society on what World War 2 was probably actually like in Nazi Germany. It pokes at the obvious ridiculous things that must have been going on back then while making you laugh until you cry and then feel sad enough to cry. There has never been a movie like this and there never will be again. This will stand alone as its own genre.
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,9/10,"Of all the things that I had watched the previous year, Jojo Rabbit overwhelmed most of them with an utterly unexpected surprise. A recent satire of a film that was officially released during October, 2019, Jojo Rabbit describes the life of a young kid named, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (portrayed by Roman Griffin Davis), who was involved into Hilter's Youth camp during the final years of the Third Reich.Based on the book named Caging Skies by author Christine Leunens, the movie revolves around Jojo and his imaginary friend Hitler himself (thankfully he was the pigmentation of Jojo's thoughts, deviated and satirical on the screen), plotting around Jojo's life as a devoted Nazi. As the story progresses, ten-year-old Jojo begins experiencing the truth behind the Nazi regime and begins to doubt the whole thing. Well, enough with the synopsis.Jojo Rabbit despite a comedy-drama, reminded of acclaimed films from the older days like Das Boot (1981), Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), and Downfall (2004), relating to the evils and flaws surrounding the infamous Third Reich of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. But Jojo Rabbit brought in a perspective that was unknown to the audience. It played along with a serious plot where things could've gone wrong in the smallest mistakes. Indeed, Nazi Germany is remembered as a black-part of modern history, and people might not agree with the film's portrayal. But in personal opinion, it was done in a much-justified manner, despite the historical facts.Amazing acting work by Roman Griffin Davis, Taika Waititi (also the director) and Scarlett Johansson, along with special mentions to Sam Rockwell, who had portrayed Captain K. Some of the elements in the film may have seemed obvious, but some of the comic scenes were simply hilarious and original (eg - the Yorki Panzerschreck scene). I was pretty much hooked into the film from the beginning, mostly for the uncanny satiric depiction of all the characters in the given scenarios. Despite being a comedy-drama, there were intense scenes that gave the movie more reasons to understand in depth.A genuine movie in most of its runtime with happy and down moment. It was indeed a really wonderful and enjoyable experience to watch the whole way. If you are sensitive to subjects related to Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, or the Second World War, do employ discretion. But I'd highly suggest everyone watching this film due to its humanistic message and its moral understanding."
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,10/10,"You know that 'Forrest Gunp' feel good feeling? Yes I really liked the movie Forest Gunp, but man, this movie was on another level of feel good.. I mean feel really really good.
It made me laugh out loud and cry like a baby at the same time. Everything about this movie was top notch. From excellent acting to script and the setting and perfectly directed. In my opinion I'd give it a 10/10 in every aspect.
I've gotta give it to the kid actor, Roman Griffin Davis. I mean for a young actor, an outstanding performance. One of the best kid actors I've seen so far.
This is one of those movies you don't mind watching again and again.. I doubt I'll ever get tired of watching it."
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2019,9/10,"I watched the movie on Sunday, and was stunned at how great it was. It was really able to show how stupid and ridiculous racism is, and did it in such an entertaining way. I laughed so many times, and even cried at the end. Somebody had better get an Oscar for this"
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2019,9/10,"I loved this movie. It was wildly entertaining, and hilarious, and made light of how stupid and absurd racism is. I've seen some people say that the movie was offensive. These people clearly either haven't seen the movie, or did not pay attention at all. It paints the Nazis as they should be: horrible, demonic monsters with no morals. And it gives the Jewish people a voice. It simply does this in a satirical way, which in my opinion is an absolutely brilliant way to do this, if done correctly. It's sad, happy, and in the end very uplifting. I cried tears of laughter, sadness, and joy. Please watch this movie. If you are to see any movie this year, please let it be Jojo Rabbit"
JOJO RABBIT,2 April 2021,9/10,"Wow! The trailer did not do this film justice. I remember seeing it at the cinema and thinking 'that looks ridiculous'. This is a tale of humanity, terror, love, war and everything in between. By reminding us that actual children - filled with imagination, first crushes and innocence - lived through this, it humanises the war and the 'enemy'. Equal parts heart wrenching and heartwarming, this made me laugh and cry. Incredible acting, fantastic script and the most original film I've seen in a long time. Beautiful."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,10/10,"First movie of the year in cinema for me and it's a brilliant start to the year. A brazenly original movie with a universally excellent cast among them the two young leads, the director himself and the always brilliant Sam Rockwell. From the opening scene I knew I was going to love this. A satire on Hitler's Germany I don't want to say anything that could spoil your enjoyment. A fantastic soundtrack, it looks excellent, has moments of fantastic humour, moments of suspence and moments that are so gutwrenching it's like getting a punch in the stomach. Taika Waititi take a bow your movie has shot into my all time favourites list and I'm around a long time!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2021,10/10,"This film is one of the best historical fictions I have seen so far. It's both heartwarming and heartbreaking! I would like to watch this again and again until I forget each scene that would make me watch it again. Lol. Oh, and let me add the musical scores used. They just placed so much feels in the whole film. I don't fancy Johansson before but after seeing this, I think she has portrayed the best mom in the world."
JOJO RABBIT,26 May 2020,9/10,"Taika Waititi proved how great he is ,after his hilarious action Superhero adaptation Thor Ragnarok ,he proved he can do much better in emotional drama too . Jojo Rabbit is very sweet and generous adaptation of Hitler's empire in world war two .It's dark but funny, slow but wonderful, disturbing but worth watching. I laughed , I cried ,laughed, cried........., and I cheered at the last hats off to Taika Waititi. It's full of emotions, each character has been written very deeply and emotionally specially lead character Jojo a little soldier of Hitler's army. Fighting alone against his loneliness. Taught inaccurately, More than that this movie shows cruelty of Hitler's army in a funny and ironical way. This movie is much more than it appears on screen.This story is about a kid named Jojo living with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), taught to become a cruel nazi ,in a camp ,he has a habbit of talking to his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler, he thinks himself a beloved little nazi . His life changes completely when he find a Jewish girl hidden in his attic and the journey of their chemistry begins which gives full of tears in our eyes .Taika uses his humorous dialogues and scenes to show the cruelty and stupidity of nazi's. Other than Jojo and Jewish girl Elsa ,Rosie too has a secret life .Acting performances are the best thing in this film or I say it is everything in it ,emotional character development, humorous dialogues, gorgeous visuals and the screenplay are the other plus point to this movie, there are some minus points but can be forgotten. Scarlett Johansson, Thomasin McKenzie, Sam Rockwell, Roman Griffin Davis and remarkable camio of Taika Waititi himself are the real gems of the film .Do not miss this masterpiece, you won't get it again. Must watch 🤗🤗"
JOJO RABBIT,4 October 2021,8/10,"This is a brilliant movie on two fronts. It's a great tragedy and an even better comedy. The story starts off hilariously but gets sadder and sadder as it goes on a surprisingly hopeful end. All of the acting is on point and very belivable. Roman Griffin Davis and Scarlett Johansson's performances were particularly good. All of the emotional beats hit and hit hard and the comedy is even better. Taika Wattiti's Hitler was my favourite character in the movie. The only point where I felt like Wattiti was struggling to split the two genres was in the climax. While all this horrific stuff is going on around them, the main charcters almost kill the vibe by joking all the way through. The soundtrack was cool and the cinematography was well used. Totally deserved the oscar. 8/10."
JOJO RABBIT,8 May 2021,6/10,"I went to see this at Its local premiere and I really cant say I was not entertained with everything, the satire, the visuals, the characters. It would be a great film if I did not feel like it had some liberal message behind it. Even if so it is still pretty funny. The film probably deserves more publicity as It has not been talked about much for a while now."
JOJO RABBIT,3 November 2019,10/10,"The trailer for the movie had me scratching my head but as a HUGE fan of Waititi I felt I ought to give it a shot.My best spoiler free review is that this is an original, outrageous film. The emotional gamut we are subjected to is whiplash inducing, but without the neck brace and ambulance chasing lawyers.Every actor is perfection. Young JoJo and Yorkie are devastatingly earnest and so talented. Sam Rockwell is always a master. Every subtle satire is underwritten with a grim level of truth. The soundtrack n unexpected choice.Go see it. Prepare yourself for quite a ride."
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,7/10,Ummm...really dont understand the high rating for this movie...it was average at best.
JOJO RABBIT,12 September 2020,,"Wow every emotion was triggered during this film.
Every character was perfect. How can some people just get things so right."
JOJO RABBIT,19 November 2020,8/10,Wonderful film. Hilarious one moment but shocking the next. Great acting performances by all involved. I know there will be those who don't get it but personally I really enjoyed it.
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a miraculous film that does the near impossible. It's far and away my favorite film of 2019, and in my top 25 all-time. I don't want to spoil it, but if you're open to a poignant, beautifully crafted, anti-war, WWII period satire...look no further. For those questioning how all of these elements work together, please research the work of Mel Brooks, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Roberto Benigni. Taika Waititi is following in a long tradition of making anti-war films that offer a range of emotion and depth. A+"
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,6/10,"This satirical comedy(?) is definitely an unique take to the war, through the eyes of a young boy. However, while Waititi's comedic touch was a welcoming addition to Thor Ragnarok, it did not work so well in this film.Due to its outrageous but family friendly tone which keeps jumping from one to another, I find it hard to approach this film in the right manner to perhaps get the most out of it. It felt like the film was trying to find the fine balance between solemnity and comedy throughout but never achieved it. This inconsistency made me invest in the main characters less and made me wonder if there was indeed any hidden story morals at all to take out from.That being said, this film has strong casts, with Scarlet and Roman standing out the most. So kudos to them.The whole atmosphere of this film feels more like a spin off or an abridged version of something greater, I feel like it is too casual and forced for its own good, especially when related to the second world war.All in all, a good popcorn flick with a somewhat heart warming ending with a message or two. By no means the over hyped masterpiece that others make it out to be in my opinion. Chances are you will either like it or not depending on your take on its tone."
JOJO RABBIT,27 November 2020,9/10,"I saw this movie yesterday, and was a bit worried that it would be a bit of an inappropriate movie, considering the trailer. But, as I was done browsing and just wanted to put on a movie I went for it anyway. And I was amazed by this movie.It takes on a difficult topic, and makes it accessible and very witty. There was a lot of laughing and a lot of crying during this movie. I can definitely recommend it, acting is superb too."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,8/10,"I don't get the fuss about this movie, seriously people it's 2020. You are watching a political satire. You should expect that some people will be made fun of. I think the ultimate respect for the victims is to consistently make fun of such fascistic dictatorship and point out how such behaviours could have been prevented with more active involvement.I feel the whole analogy of Hitler talking to a child who doesn't understand the strength of such words and actions, perfectly illustrates what Nazis were all about while living the lie of ideology. Characters are convincing and charming and the cinematography is beautiful. I don't think Scarlett Johansson will win an Oscar for this one and Waititi remains consistent to his style portraying the ungrateful role of Adolf Hitler in a decent and entertaining manner. On the other hand, the raw talent of Roman Griffin Davis is out of this world, being able to capture a wide spectrum of emotions at such an early age.Lastly, I think this quote by Thomasin McKenzie outlines the whole idea of the movie and illustrates the lie Nazi Germany was living at that time: ""You're a ten year-old kid, who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club. But you are not one of them."""
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi directs this dark comedy. The amazingly funny film revolves around a little boy who thinks he's a nazi, but finds a girl living in his walls, and he might be wrong about his choice of politics. Jojo Rabbit has a couple of gruesome images, including a bloody hand and a graphic wound on Hitler's head. There are a few swear words, including the f word right at the end. There are no scary scenes, but there are a few intense scenes. Some scenes are severely depressing."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,2/10,"This is the farcical side of hollywood. Cash grabbing tacticts are being devised to exploit our sentiments.
It's a comedy movie in which the characteristic was hardly perceivable. They have included this in the war and the history genre, which in my opinion is a travesty."
JOJO RABBIT,14 April 2020,8/10,"In the film, Joe Joe's seemingly innocent ideas, the fantasy of Hitler as a friend, the attitude that the world is so beautiful, and the Hitler Youth League, which is like a summer children's summer camp, make me wonder ridiculously that the story of the movie ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" was set in Germany in 1945, or in the United States in 2019, and it was Joe Joe's love and addiction to Nazism. It is like a protective bubble around the body, although it can temporarily isolate the outside world, but when it is broken, it also highlights the ruthlessness and cruelty of the real society.""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" because Joe Joe can not distinguish between good and evil young age, through him to take everything seriously, but in the eyes of the audience is like a playful way, showing the Nazis brainwashing people, idolatry at that time, let everyone blindly follow the phenomenon. Like Joe Joe, who could not hurt a rabbit at a training camp, but was able to point a knife at a Jewish girl who was indoctrinated by the Nazis as a reader, magic and unkind, didn't it show that many German soldiers might have been like Joe at the time, not that their nature was so bad, but that they were otherwise manipulated by the people in power?The illusory and reality of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""Baijia / YizhiTherefore, while we are still enjoying Joe Joe's lovely fantasies and many absurd jokes in the film, ""the fantasy world of the young Joe Joe"" suddenly uncovers the reality of the war hidden behind the farce, just as a huge change without the original greenhouse protection will make people so caught off guard. Comedy is always based on tragedy. It depends on the way you look at it, but whether you are happy or sad. "" This sentence is like the truth, in the back of the film continues to revolve around my head, how funny the whole film, the final regret is as heavy as tears.Through a less unexpected, the film hit the audience deep inside the plot, turning all the supporting roles and bridges that brought laughter in front of them into tearful ones. With Joe Joe's relationship with Jewish girl Aisha, not only did the hostility gradually ease, but Joe also finally realized his mistake in understanding others and found himself who he really was. Scarlett. Johnson's mother said to Joe: ""when you fall in love with someone, you feel butterflies flying in your stomach."" It was just that when Joe Joe finally realized the feeling, his mother had left him forever.The pain and growth of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""Baijia / Yiqi movies""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" unfolds the real world wrapped in sugar with a light and smooth rhythm, turning the boy from blind obedience to questioning the growth story into a warm and sad war fairy tale. I can fully feel the director trying to tell through the film the loss and gain, pain and joy, loss and bravery that he may experience in the process of growing up, and magnify the nature of love and hope in life. As far as I am concerned, I have recently seen a lot of movies about children stepping into the adult world, but only ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" can do without any children. The head makes such a huge contrast, bringing a very strong resonance and reflection space.I like ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" to bring out the merciless war of World War II through the change of character's point of view and mood, and the contrast highlights the warmth and precious emotion between family and family. The film is full of emotion, not only as the director of the boy's imaginary father Hitler. Videtti brightened his eyes, Scarlett Joe Hansen and Sam. The Rockwell supporting actors were also perfectly interpreted, taking the audience to see that although there were many things we should cherish in the most cruel times, just as Jews were no different from us, so were the children in Nazi Germany.The core theme of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""Baijia / Yiqi moviesAlthough Joe Joe failed to break the head of a rabbit, in order to prove that he had robbed a grenade from the instructor and only hurt himself, when he ended up in a world of war full of hatred, only by plucked up the courage to cross and face up to the reality that people wanted to escape, so that he could become an independent individual to explore the future, and face more difficulties and challenges that must be borne by himself in the future. Perhaps this is what each of us must experience. Or have already experienced, look back still feel a little melancholy process.""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" is not to criticize the evil deeds of the Nazis, nor to preach the value of freedom and democracy, but to present it from one of the purest angles. The damage caused by this war, and once again stresses that ""everything must be learned in person"", a core value that is still very important to this day. When we see the true appearance of the world and understand the rules of the game that survive in this society, do we also have to learn from it? Shouldn't you let yourself turn a blind eye to the good and evil in it? Choose to work hard for the overall beauty and progress? I think it's all the theme the movie finally wants to convey."
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2020,9/10,"Children are not as naive as they think. Their world is full of colorful and colorful. What they fear most is ghosts, ghosts, monsters and multi-dimensional drawings that adults can't see. Adults are not as wise as they can see. Their world is full of rights, money, beauty and life and death disputes. What they are most afraid of is that they can't see the heart clearly, and the truth, goodness and beauty are gradually lost. Children will eventually become adults, but they can choose to keep the innocence and clear eyes of the world. Adults can't go back to children, but they can choose to keep the pure and clear eyes on children."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2021,9/10,"Gosh, this movie is amazing! Taika took this silly premise about Nazis and this 10 year old body and he turned it to an genuinely funny but also really heartfelt movie with great characters and messages. A lot of the jokes land really well and are placed appropriately throughout the movie and they never interrupt any emotional beats. Watiti manages to balance the emotional beats and comedy really well, which is something I felt like he struggled a bit in Ragnarok but he improved a lot here. Every actor gives a 10/10 Oscar worthy performance and they have great dynamics and chemistry together and seeing Jojo changing his beliefs about Nazis and Jews is believable, emotional and executed really well. It's a pretty great message. These German citizens were mailupulated to believe these ridiculous lies. It's your chocie if you want to believe in it. I kind of wish the movie was longer as I wanted to spend more time with Joe's mom, friends and Jew girlfriend but that's my ln;t complaint. All I can day is go see this movie. It's emotional, has a great message, great acting, prodiction designs and it's really entertaining if you just want 2 hours of fun."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2021,9/10,"Really great movie. got recommended to me by Klara a long time ago. I think she told me it was like comedy but kind of dark, and also satirical. I was very skeptical and was not very keen on watching it; One of my friends had seen it in my downloads (legal) and he told me that he also wanted to watch it, and so we did! Great movie. I don't like ""comedy"" movies because I never find them funny. They've always just been something that I put on to have in the background. But pay attention, cause if you look at your phone for more than a minute you will miss something important. Story was definition of bittersweet.-watched with Tor"
JOJO RABBIT,5 April 2021,9/10,So delicate yet fun! You have to watch this! I laughed and I cried- I loved this film and will watch it again very soon. So so beautifully made.
JOJO RABBIT,10 May 2021,9/10,"JoJo Rabbit is an absolutely outstanding film with great humour and tons of heart. The cast is perfection with everyone giving stand out performances and I adored Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo. The tonal shifts in this film can be a bit jarring at times but that was honestly my only issue with the film everything else was perfect for me. I laughed, I cried and I was completely charmed by JoJo Rabbit and its the kind of unique and refreshing film I wish we got more often. The films visual style that just screams Waititi is amazing and he clearly put a lot of passion into this film and it shows. The shoe scene is remarkably heartbreaking and emotional and took me my complete surprise. I simply adore this film and I would highly recommend that everyone watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,9/10,"Don't let the subject matter dissuade you, this is a beautiful film, incredibly funny, well thought out and perfectly delivered."
JOJO RABBIT,17 July 2020,9/10,Loved this film it had it funny parts and absolutely tragic parts . i felt invested with this little scamp all the way through the film and his little mate near the end had me in stitches. it was great that they mixed in comedy into a dire subject matter and it really worked. wish i could forget it so i could watch it again for the first time...great film
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,10/10,"I'm not sure I could love this film more. I hesitated giving it a 10, because I've learned some considerably disturbing things about how the weighted rating system of imbd works. But I've got to stick to my gut on this and Jojo Rabbit just is too tremendous a film to not rave about. Creativity, script, balls!, performances, humanity, this imaginative film has it all! Congrats to all involved!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2021,10/10,"Everything was done tastefully. Film looked colourful and beautiful. The right amounts of funny, silly and serious.Everyone brought something to their role even for the smaller roles that received only a bit of screen time"
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"""We can be heroes...just for one day"" I didn't think I would be moved in this way! Just like everybody else who understood this movie, I laughed and I cried!"
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,9/10,"***Next test might be perceived in an inappropriate manner, but this was made specifically to bring more understanding*** thank you for understanding.""JoJo Rabbit"" is a great example of historical tragic-comedy genre impregnated with satire and the modern creative way of working. Together with great cast, perfect shots, color palette, costumes, perfectly written story - all of this (and lot of other) creates one of the most amazing and sincere movie of 2019.Oh... the cast. Scarlett. This year is whole yours. It belong to you and only You. From Natasha to Nicole and then to Rosie. So different characters, so different performances, and all of this in 1 Year!! For your astonishing work - You are deserve an Oscar. The chemistry between young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) and Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) sometimes remind another beautiful cinema couple - Zero & Agatha (The Grand Budapest Hotel). Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen -you guys are rock, and it doesn't even matter what uniform you are wear! And a young Archie Yates - wow, what a great work from this dude. If in future, there will be adaptation ""Up"", from Pixar animation to movie, Archie it is the first candidate to play Russell.Overall ""Jojo Rabbit"" it a product of love, passion, humanism and antifascist message. It is like Taika Waititi and Wes Anderson had a love, but before conception act, they both were inspired by ""Forrest Jump"" and ""Life Is Beautiful"", and both understood what would they future child should look."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,10/10,"I didnt check out what the movie was about before i watched it and i must say it was a good choice.
I havent seen anything this funny for years.
My two favorite characters were Fraulein Rahm and Adolf.
Best line in the movie for me was "" Go give americans a hug ""
U gotta watch this"
JOJO RABBIT,14 March 2020,10/10,"A feel good film which you shouldn't miss.
That Kid , That Girl and Scarlet Johansson . The music, the story , the pace of the film everything is exactly where it should be . Taika Waititi is amazing and inspiration to look forward to. Dancing."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is incredibly good. The story is original and an interesting concept, which makes for some funny moments. Jojo's innocence and the situations in which he finds himself make us feel all kinds of emotions, but the film transitions well between humorous and touching scenes.I would highly recommend this film, as it's very moving and incredibly funny, thanks to Scarlett Johansson and Taika Waititi in particular. It leaves me eager to discover more of Waititi's work."
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,8/10,"It's everything but not a casual movie that's for sure. It's simply genius. Through a few characters we are introduced to the whole german generation of the Nazi era, the beliver, the victim, the soldier, the mother and children. Via them we can understand that a system that is rotten from it's core can destroy a whole nation a whole generation and casualties will be on all sides. Also it makes us wonder what could have we done as a 20 years old boy living in München in 1939. Probably we would have died on the battlefields regardles of our belief or disbelief in nazi ideology. Worst than that we might have been infested by their ideas. All in all a very clever movie that makes us think."
JOJO RABBIT,4 April 2020,4/10,"This movie is so phony and dishonest compared to Waititi's early/New Zealand stuff. It's just a horrible Wes Anderson knock off that takes itself way too seriously. You can tell everyone involved probably couldn't stop telling one another how ""important"" it was to make. Another victim of hollywood's asskissing fest. Waititi is being told(for your consideration/oscar campaign) that this is his best work, when it's his worst. I imagine he's on the downward path to hackville, as the money and accolades roll in. The harder fought battles were far more interersting. You cant be cute and political. Anti-Tarantino."
JOJO RABBIT,6 June 2020,9/10,"Just a quick review. Having read critics review I was dubious about this film. I was really surprised how good it was, well worth a watch"
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a powerful satire anti hate (with touches of a light comedy) about a kid who doesn't know his place in the world and believes what he is told just to feel he belongs somewhere. The first half of the movie will bring you tears of laugh and the second one tears of sadness. But the way it combines both, through the eccentric and wise vision of Taika Waititi, is truly special."
JOJO RABBIT,3 July 2020,10/10,"This is a masterpiece! A piece of art! Everything about this movie is brilliant. Great directing, writing, editing, music, cinematography, acting, costumes, makeup, set pieces and locations. It's a fresh motion picture and it gives me faith that there is still talented movie makers out there. The story is amazing and the way it's told is also amazing and I enjoyed every minute of this properly structured and crafted movie. This movie made me die of laughter and cry my eyes out. It was funny, sad and dramatic and it's everything you want. Every important character had their own story and traits in this movie and the character arcs are spectacular. People might be turned off by the heavy subject matter but it is handled really well as it's from the view of a 10 year old boy who's been brainwashed to think the way he thinks but the film does not shy away from getting dark and serious.I highly recommend this upcoming classic to every age group. It can teach us so much about love, hate and our views of the world."
JOJO RABBIT,11 April 2020,10/10,This movie was amazing!!!!! The cast was top notch !!!! This movie was both hilarious and emotional at the same time. Do your self a favor and watch this movie. I am officially a number 1 fan of Waititi for life !!!!! Looking forward to his future work and will definitely watch all of his past work.
JOJO RABBIT,9 August 2020,5/10,"Mixed feelings about Jojo Rabbit. Enjoyed all the individual characters, JJR cast well, all the actors were good in their roles. My problem was the uninteresting story, the humor mostly falls flat especially the Hitler/Nazi jokes. Expected more from JJR, was disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,7 May 2021,8/10,"My husband just loves anything about the World Wars. I personally find things on the wars difficult to watch and tend to avoid them. So when he suggested we watch this I rolled my eyes....Yes there are some really upsetting bits, but my god is it funny!It's a movie on a serious topic that is to not be taken too seriously! Having Hitler portrayed this way I think was brilliant.Very much worth a watch 😌"
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,7/10,I desperately wanted this film to entertain me but it spit little out of its uneven scrip occasionally keeping my attention to pick up speed which delivered a thud. Drink a lot of coffee to keep up your attention.
JOJO RABBIT,13 August 2021,8/10,"I love this movie. It's got comedy, heart, heartbreak, history, a teeny bit of romance and a small amount of action. It's just a great movie. Super unique and well written. I laughed and then cried a little, but then laughed some more-all while on the edge of my seat. This movie left huge smile on my face. Highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,24 August 2020,6/10,"Great movie!
Sam Rockwell was awesome! And Roman Griffin Davis was outstanding as Jojo.
It certainly was interesting to see the horrors of WWII through the whimsical imagination of a 10 year old German boy.
If you don't want spoilers than stop reading now.The only thing I didn't like is when the mom dies. Yes, I know that people die in movies to provoke certain emotions, but the mother's death was too gloomy and I was depressed for the rest of the film. Even the happy ending wasn't enough to undo the disturbing imagery of Jojo seeing his dead mother."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,10/10,"An unsettling portrayal of WWII Germany that demonstrates tyranny through satire. This film follows the life of an average 10yr old aryan boy who is devoted to the ideological Hitler of WWII and then discovers great sadness and despair through first hand experiences of the lies he has been fed.I thoroughly enjoyed the film because it brings to light the fragility of societies integrity and how easily some are influenced by political leaders and commentators - sadly much of the thinking of Nazi Germany has always existed, is certainly prevalent today and will always be."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"This movie really touched me. I was sceptical about a satirical treatment of such a serious topic as Nazism and the treatment of Jews. The story gripped me from the start with the unusual concept of having Hitler as an imaginary friend of a coming-of-age boy. But the moral dilemma he faces is supported with great performances, weight and emotions, funny dialog and decisive moral choices.
This is not a light movie but one that reaffirms the power of humanity."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,Haven't enjoyed a movie in quite some time like this one. This is the best movie i've seen after some time. So hilariously done.
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,9/10,"The idea of a funny, yet touching, take on WWII and Nazism is not entirely original, of course. It's easy to think of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, but also, more recently, of Benigni's La vita è bella (Life is beautiful).
Jojo Rabbit is more irreverent and less poetic than the two mentioned films, but it has got a unique point of view and I enjoyed it a lot.The story is very well written, coherent and consistent in every aspect. It doesn't last three hours and it has got just one, clear ending. Thank you Mr. Waititi!Each character is depicted with lots of humor, and sometimes silliness, but none of the main ones is ever too ridiculous as to lose its humanity or depth. No scene is too dramatic, but some are quite moving.I liked all the actors, I loved the ending and I adored the music. The scenes at the beginning comparing Beatlemania with ""Nazimania"", with the German version of I want to hold your hand playing loud, are just brilliant.A film like this is just what we all need at this strange time of history we are living right now."

There were more scenes of audible laughter than in any other film we saw. Our last film of the festival, we were watching this film as it was being awarded the landmark award of the festival; a consummate way to close off the festival!Set in Germany during the Second World War, Jojo Rabbit is vastly different than the films we think of from this setting. Some will argue that it makes light of the horrors of the time. It is frivolous in its interpretation of the superhero status of Hitler (portrayed as the young character's imaginary friend Adolf) as well as the horrid descriptions of Jews. Some viewers may find this unsettling.While it is certainly much lighter than we would expect from a film on Nazi Germany, there are lessons of acceptance under the humour. From a child's perspective, we can see the effects of propaganda and brainwashing by the state, and the power of personal relationships in changing that narrative. With witty pacing and a dynamic cast, the characters become larger-than-life, but balance with each other in the point of view of a young boy.While this film will be one of the more controversial of the year, it is undoubtedly funny, and is sure to be a crowd pleaser. You are sure to laugh your way through the film and discuss it long after."
JOJO RABBIT,20 August 2020,9/10,"""Let everything happen to you:
beauty and terror.
Just keep going.
No feeling is final""No one's life is smooth-sailing; everyone experiences varying degrees of ups and downs in every stage of their life. Jojo Rabbit is a film that understands this: throughout the runtime, Jojo himself goes through moments of joy and freedom, but also heartbreak and despair. Your life will inevitably take a turn for the worst, even when you're at the top of the world, because we all know that nothing lasts forever (""No feeling is final""). What I love is that the film teaches us that heartbreak and sadness are inevitable; so in order to overcome them, we need to keep our faith in the moment (""Just keep going"") and to appreciate both the beautiful and the horrible (""Let everything happen to you"").What I adore about the film is that it just oozes with beauty: mainly because of the heartwearming themes (as discussed above), but also because of Emotion. Waititi places the emotions as the driving force behind the story, and that's the reason why we're compelled as an audience. We don't just see Jojo's mother die - we feel the gut-punch alongside him, and when Jojo starts to grow feelings for Elsa, we also feel a tangible connection growing in our stomach. It's a film that features genuine and real emotion, and it's certainly one of the aspects that contribute towards my adoration of the film.I cannot write about Jojo Rabbit without mentioning the ending: it is, without a doubt, one of my favourite film endings ever. The dancing is such a perfect embodiment of the themes of the film, and it really wouldn't be the same without Bowie's 'Heroes'. It brings such a sweet grin to my face, one that can only be achieved through real warmth and pure emotion. Jojo Rabbit is such a starkly-beautiful film, one that I will always cherish."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,10/10,"This movie makes you feel something every step of the way. Ignore the politically-over-obsessed movie ""critics"" and when you pull this film apart it is almost flawless. From a comedic point of view, the jokes are witty, tongue-in-cheek, perfectly timed and actually have you laughing. From a dramatic point of view, the story explores a vast variety of relationships in the eyes of a young nazi and his self conflict. It is perfectly timed the entire way, makes you cry from laughter and sadness, is perfectly performed by it's cast, beautifully pictured by it's crew, and phenomenally directed by the maker. WATCH THIS FILM, it is flawless."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,10/10,"Very fun, heartfelt, comedy set in WW2. The movie was fantastic! Taika Waititi made a completely original comedy during an era of sequels, prequels, and comic book movies. I will highly recommend this movie to anyone I can find!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 July 2021,10/10,"Only movie that has reached ""La Vita E Bella"" level of brilliance, yet managed to be its own uniqueness.Folks, see it, you will not be sorry. Unless you are jealous movie critic."
JOJO RABBIT,6 July 2020,7/10,The little boy jojo done a great role. From this movie we'll learn peace is important for the life and don't hate anybody by their birth. And the final dance makes me happy....!!!
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a wonderful cinematic masterclass. The plot, and acting, is comedic yet emotionally hard hitting and historically accurate coupled with a twinge of comedic relief. This is a film not to miss out on. I look forward to Taika's new Star Wars film, he is a classy, modern director - a breath of fresh air!"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"An actor of Jewish descent playing Hitler in a film that he writes, produces and directs. Honestly, it couldn't be better!Jojo Rabbit is not about the Nazi dictator, but about Jojo, a 10-year-old German boy who has the tyrant as an imaginary friend during the end of World War II. Jojo is another member of the Hitlerist Youth indoctrinated to praise blindly his country, his prejudices, his leader and the Reich, even in the decay of war. And it is with a lot of acid comedy and black humor that the work satirizes this, pointing out all the lunatic fanaticism that permeated the Nazis of that time - And of the present times.With an excellent timing for the satirical strips, jokes and direct criticisms that flow in the speeches of the characters and in the montage of the scenes, with the right to mention the ""Aryan"" clones that the Nazis tried to produce and that needed to ""go for a walk"", the comedy Jojo Rabbit, based on a literary drama, treats the delicate subject of World War II terror with great care and comic mastery.There is a fine line between what can be approached without disrespect to those attacked by the Holocaust and between apologies for that movement, and the film works on it in a very clever way - perhaps only seen before in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Bastards.With the core of the narrative the young fanatic 10 years old who finds a Jewish girl being hidden by his mother in his own home, the film shows Jojo starting an internal debate, sympathy for the fugitive and, consequently, empathy and humanity for her . Jojo's progress in putting reason in the place of ideological fanaticism is a comic and striking statement against prejudice and growing discrimination in the present day since the horrors that happened in the 1940s.The most delicate point when making a work of this type is the question of the appropriation of lives that could be insulted depending on its presentation. By focusing on the core of the boy and his imaginary Nazi friend, the only really appropriate life in Jojo Rabbit is that of Adolf Hitler himself who is recreated and debauched in a stubborn, clueless, cowardly and cartoonish version coming directly from a child's imagination. , in a very necessary way.Featuring Nazis blind to common sense and the country's situation and believers only to what they didn't even see, the unreal caricatures of their enemies, the Jews, the film humorously emphasizes the Nazi prejudice and ignorance that he blamed, without no logic, to other peoples due to unusual situations that were actually caused by themselves, as in the case of a fat uncle, drunkard and gambler who only did what he did because he had been ""hypnotized by the powers of the Jews"".With a production of realistic scenarios and a soundtrack from the 80's, this modern work that covers a fiction located in the 40's and with reflections in the current reality has the excellent performance of the young Roman Griffin Davis, who plays Jojo, of the world star Scarlett Johansson in the role of her zealous and spontaneous mother, and Taika Waititi who signs the work, gives paper and criticizes, for being exaggerated and ridiculous who Hitler was and how his ideas sounded.What incredible irony! A film full of swastikas and intended to show their idiocy."
JOJO RABBIT,6 August 2020,10/10,"I haven't seen a movie like that in a long time, the perfect performances, the direction, the locations, the excellent movie."
JOJO RABBIT,13 November 2020,10/10,"Not at all what I expected. The final scene made me laugh and cry at once.
Please watch this absolute gem."
JOJO RABBIT,8 October 2020,7/10,"Taika Waititi's satirical, unfiltered humor undermines the tyranny of a two hour long exposure to perhaps the most notorious figure in recent history and he does it well, but perhaps a little slow. The plot doesn't have much weight until just about the point where Jojo is guided by a shiny butterfly to a spot from which he looks up just to see the shoes he recognizes so well, his mother's shoes which he is so used to see jumping up and down but this time they're not dancing. I must say this scene and further tight grip of his mother's legs as Jojo sobs childishly was undeniably touching, and tearful.From this point on, we see a classic hero's journey that we've been waiting for for the first full hour and what a delicate, warm journey it will be, mixed with classically humoristic montages with somber soundtrack in contrastbeautifully composed by Michael Giacchino. Further, we get to relate to the adolescent platonic love that we have all experienced and held a dear spot for in our hearts.Starting with Scarlett Johansson who has now transformed more into the single mother roles rather than the sexy leather-tight costume action heroin along with Sam Rockwell showing versatility for playing a comic role, casting is stellar. Stephen Merchant as the creepy looking and smiling Gestapo agent is the perfect pick for this role and the ""Heil Hitler"" sequence is just the epitome of Taika Waititi's writing. Roman Griffin and Thomasin McKenzie playing Jojo and Elsa do a fantastic job of portraying the horror of being in the midst of a war with no one to take shelter in. Also, so well-fit for the role, Archie Yates playing Yorki shows perfect comic timing and delivery.Overall, although the film starts slow, it picks up well at the midpoint and especially the last 30 minutes of it are tenderly put together. The movie is a call upon us to look within ourselves, to look for the inner curious, adventurous, daring child we all lost as we faced wars and tragedies, tragedies imposed on us by the grim reality we live in and the internal wars we expose our mind to. Taika subtly reminds us of the kid we all aspire to be, the kid within us that we lost sense of as we grew up, as we grew apart, from ourselves."
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,10/10,JoJo is my 2nd favorite movie of 2019. The director is brilliant. Every actor is likable or does a great job playing a villain. Scarlett Johanson and her child's relationship with make you laugh and cry. It exposes propaganda and puts real faces on the cycle of hatred taught to people that still exists today. This is a must watch.
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2021,9/10,"I hate MF Nazis,but this movie was very entertaining with interesting characters, especially JoJo."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,This movie stole my heart and had everything in it I could have possibly wanted. It was funny and clever but was also mature enough that it was serious about the war themes. Taika Waititi wins best performance as the imaginary friend Adolf and best director and best writing. He is such a wonderful man I feel bad for not giving him any chances until now. JoJo Rabbit deserves such a high score it really does for so many reasons
JOJO RABBIT,1 July 2020,7/10,"I expected two things from Jojo Rabbit when I seated myself in a cosily sized auditorium for the first public screening of a film since the pandemic upended our ritual of cinema-going. I knew there was going to be comedy; based on reviews, I was anticipating something deeper and more meaningful - an emotional ""soul"". It is typically the ""soul"" of a movie that fires up the ardour within me, that drives me to loud exultations and recommendations; that imparts enduring images and sentiments in my memory and my mind that continue to influence me for years to come. To my mind, only someone particularly superficial in character would want to ""simply have fun"" at the movies. Nothing in life is without even a little significance. So far as I can say, referring to my limited experience, for someone to truly enjoy a movie, it generally necessitates that the movie have what I'm calling a ""soul"". Beyond the lights and actions, the gigantic set pieces and talented visual effects, there must be even a hint of a story, a character-driven narrative, a progression from one thing to another. That is life. Anything that is otherwise is pointless, mundane, desolate. For crying out loud - even The Emoji Movie made some miserable attempt at giving the protagonist development, and insofar as it was successful, it gave meaning to the story.
Though it marries the two fairly well, I am going to argue that Jojo Rabbit wasted valuable screen time on gratuitous gags that it ought to have spent building endearing characters.I understand I differ from the majority of audiences on some things. So, while many may chuckle at the painfully vulgar words and expressions placed just-so in the mouths of pre-adolescent boys, this strikes me as plainly repellent. It is immature. And it reeks of the putrid odour that offended people of good taste when the recent Good Boys debuted a trailer on YouTube, in which one of the producers, Seth Rogen, explained to his juvenile cast that, despite perpetrating the actions themselves, they would not be allowed to legally watch this content, as they were underage. How is it that a child can legally provide MA-rated content he isn't legally permitted to watch? Moral of the story - human beings are nothing short of professional hypocrites.But back to the point. While many of the emotional beats (especially from a special moment in the movie, when the genre almost switches - so forceful is the mood-change) land on the audience with impact, there are not an awful lot of them. The movie doesn't feel exactly tight, plot-wise - it has fun with its tangential quips and gags (some quite dispensable), and spends much time in the somewhat dishonest arena of cynicism. I take issue with the kind of comedic timing that simply leaves me doubting a sincere feeling behind a dialogue, and rather encourages me to search for the hilarity in the thing - or the subversion of expectation. Some of the best laughs originate from totally inane details or event emerging from pure circumstance - a misunderstanding in language, an accident. But much of modern comedy that I find repulsive comes from places of vice, which, while not always bad, can tend to be something less-than-funny. So when I am expected to laugh at the dysfunctional relationship between mother and son, or the casual meanness of the Nazi officers, my first reaction is something more akin to sadness than amusement.Interestingly, despite feeling weighed down with so much effort to be funny, when the movie wants you to impact you, it comes down really hard! Without giving it away, the third act really switches gears - perhaps deliberately jarring the audience, so long entertained by far lighter content. This is the stuff that moves me - too bad it is limited to the third act. It would be so much better if the entire piece was better incorporated, so that it could encompass both comedy and drama at once.The music is again a travesty. I can hardly abide by the modern interpretation of 1940s Germany. Led Zeppelin is out of place, and purposefully so - I just don't like it. For me, when I see the gorgeous set decoration, talent, costumes, and all the rest, I find myself wishing it weren't a farcical parody of our very real history. The potential there for something that means so much more, is difficult to turn a blind eye on.
All this is not to say I disliked the film - it was a solid seven for me, and certainly one I would re-watch. Thomasin McKenzie is particularly striking in her contrastingly no-nonsense performance. At this point in time, it seems she has much to look forward to in her career. She isn't the main character - but without her, the film would be worthless. She provides the motivation for the protagonist to change, gives the plot all its momentum, and elevates the entire piece to something rather prettier and subtler.In closing, the film certainly has merit; and I really enjoyed the emotional beats near the end, which were quite powerful.
I think it is sincerity that I'm searching for, and in Jojo Rabbit, I find too much that is opposed to it - something contrived, not natural; something gratuitous, not measured; something ultimately less meaningful, because it is too concerned with generating laughs.Criticus - Geelong Village Cinemas, Victoria"
JOJO RABBIT,2 December 2020,8/10,"Before the first time I watched it, I would view it as a childish film. Needless to say my opinion was completely changed by the time I saw the masterful combination of tragedy and comedy by the talented director of it, Taika Waititi.
The plot is set in Germany during the WWII, when the war was getting nearer and nearer to its end. Our superhero Jojo, acted by Roman Griffin Davis, whose every moment of screen time was utilized to its full potential, is a ten year old kid with his imaginary friend, Hitler. Horrible is it to see Hitler as a child's imaginary friend; However, here the imaginary Hitler isn't like the stereotype of him that we know today, but a kind of motivator whose only only goal is to make the kid use his most potential. Nevertheless, the story doesn't end here. The main plot sets off as our Nazi super hero find a Jewish girl in his house and here is his responsibility to deal with her. The story is spectacular in its own kind as it's funny, heavy and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way.
The cast is perfection. Every actor form the director himself as the Hitler to the lovely mother of Jojo , performed by mighty Scarlett Johansson, are pushing the limits in a good way. Rarely can you find scenes with overacted performances or any other errors.
The point that has made this movie as marvelous as it is to me, is that though it is a war movie and we are expected not to really laugh at people's death, it borders on slapstick at times and it makes a great paradox for us. Once you're laughing at Hitler giving cigarette to a ten year old kid, and then you're touched by sad memories of a Jew! To my opinion, this awesome paradox has made a fabulous picture out of this masterpiece.
One of my friends is always insisting that this movie's main role is a kid. So what? You're not gonna watch it just because it's played by a KID?! Let's not view this movie at face value and give it a chance. Go see it. And prepare yourself for quite a ride."
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2019,10/10,"I have never laughed so hard at such a beautiful and tragic film in my life. The casting is so perfect. Anyone attached to this film should be very proud of themselves as they truly deserve the recognition.
Roman Griffin Davis is a fantastic little actor with a bright future and Mr. Waititi's Hitler is brilliant. Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson continue to shine as A list actors. Not surprisingly, Stephen Merchant does the best SS officer of all time, I'm still laughing. Thomasin McKenzie plays a very challenging role that she superbly emotes so many strong emotions. She does a wonderful job. And little Mr. Archie Yates is such a plucky delight. The entire cast, crew and production team all did an incredible job. I could not find a flaw in this film if I tried."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"There is no BUT!!!Everybody here is on point, emotional ride gallore!
And that is not the only thing,... what a great storyteller Waititi is!
What a good way to make people think!"
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,9/10,"Though the story is a little basic and predictable, it still got me emotional. You can just tell the general story by watching the trailer- Nazi boy meets a Jew girl, then they bond and get closer, then he eventually learns his prejudice ways were wrong and he changes. We've all seen this type of story many times before, but what makes this movie stand out is the execution from the amazing screenplay and amazing acting. There also still some little surprises from the story, one of which that got me very emotional.My only minor problem with the movie is I thought it would be funnier. Don't get me wrong, there's still many funny moments, but nothing laugh at loud funny. But I didn't care about the comedy as much, because I was more engaged in the actual story."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,8/10,"The comedy was more than its main selling point, the acting was probably the best I've seen from younger actors in a long time and the costume design was really well done, achieving more than just being icing on a Setting cake. Some of the dialogue and shot comp was definitely inspired by Wes Anderson, which was sometimes a bit distracting, however it made up for it with the characters actually delivering the dialogue with emotion. Every character felt unique and realistic, all of the actors brought their A-game and really committed to their characters nicely."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,7/10,"As we all know Germany was manipulated by Hitler. In this movie we see what was going on in those days by a 10 year old german boy's eyes. Althought it makes us laugh, this is a serious movie. I recommend it to everyone."
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2020,9/10,"Contemporary German family version of the beautiful life style of processing, plot rhythm and emotional music, fully control the audience's emotions, whether it is a simple comedy or tragic scene, or even full of many scenes of joy and sorrow. The most advanced tragedy is to make people cry in funny pictures, and the most advanced comedy is to make people laugh in sadness. I rely on this movie, and the director has done both! It's a bit of a bull!"
JOJO RABBIT,24 August 2020,10/10,What did they do well it is very simple. They made nazis likable. I repeat they made NAZIS LIKABLE
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2021,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is an extremely clever, moving and subtle movie, but a lot of people will probably never watch it because most of the critics, as usual, totally miss the point and the movies promo preview makes it seem like a silly comedy when it is anything but. Comparisons with The Producers are ridiculous. Jojo is not meant to be anything like that. Yes, it ridicules Nazis and extremists generally, but while the Producers was always just a great comedy, Jojo is a at heart a drama and a coming of age story. I was genuinely surprised when I watched it because it was so unexpected and totally differ from the picture the critics and promo had painted. Watch it with an open mind and I think you'll see just how good it is."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,10/10,"I came out of this with a solid feeling of ""the work speaks for itself."" Intensely gorgeous and clever, ""Jojo Rabbit"" delivers a sardonically crisp slap in the face that many people need, and right now."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2020,10/10,It's a beautiful movie that'll make you laugh as well as cry.
JOJO RABBIT,19 July 2020,9/10,"If I was Jewish, I would be very offended by this movie. That aside, I loved the dark inappropriate humor about a time in history that should not be forgotten. It was funny, touching and sad. The acting was wonderful by all with the 10 year old giving us an Oscar worthy performance."
JOJO RABBIT,19 December 2020,10/10,Cried and laughed and cried and laughed straight 2 hours. Perfect.
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"First film I've seen this year and could well be the best. Taika Waititi is a frigging genius. From what we do in the Shadows to Thor, to this. Can't wait to see what he does next.No film about Nazi Germany, with the funniest Hitler since The producers, should be that life affirming. You'll start the movie laughing off and end it on tears. Go see. It's truly a truly wonderful piece of art.Oh, and Scarlet Johansen is awesome as the mother. Great performances all round as it goes."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,10/10,"This is a movie that will tell you a story about a tragedy trough comedy. It will make you remember you know how to laugh, even tho' your tears are still on your cheeks. And it's an amazing movie."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,10/10,Ironic. Funny. Sad. Real. Brilliant. I can't remember a movie making a mix of all these feelings at the same like this one did. Everyone must have this.
JOJO RABBIT,18 April 2021,8/10,"So versatile. War background, dramatic plot, documentary-like history, dark humorous comedy, racial issue, romantic element, good acting with strong cast.Except some impolite lines, this film should be loved by most audience."
JOJO RABBIT,25 August 2020,8/10,"If I had any complaint it would be that it wasn't as edgy as I was hoping it would be. At times it feels like it wants to be like ""South Park"" but instead holds back as to not have to extreme shifts in tone from scene to scene. Like a less polished/flowing version of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". That being said what I did get was a pretty good movie with likable and funny characters."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,"First things first, I love Taika.
This movie made me laugh and made me cry. Such a beautiful film with great actors and great cinematography. It was an extraordinary experience with a great message, definetly one of my favorite films of the year. Jojo Rabbit is a great example of comedy, satire and drama all together, very exciting and visually stunning. A must watch."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,5/10,"If you want to film a comedy about something traumatic as II World War was you need a very bold and smart screenplay. None of these you have in Jojo Rabbit, if you take a movie as Life is beautiful, where you have everything.
BTW, main actor kid is adorable."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,"Funny, sad and heartwarming! I loved this movie and the cast was amazing everyone did a great job. Go see it!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 June 2020,3/10,"I don't really know what the intention was of the filmmakers. Nor am I going to join the chorus of those calling it satire because it wasn't funny. As for self-disclosure of my own biases, count me among those who don't think WWII was a laugh riot.
The establishing first thirty minutes of the movie are fine but after that it quickly turns very boring, the narrative meanders and the film quickly runs out of steam. Given the horrendous historical period in which the film is set, the middle part of the movie doesn't make any meaningful statement or give any purpose to the antics we are watching. Cute and childish seemed to be the order of the day with public lynching, sadism, racism, and unlimited human suffering thrown in as mere set decoration. The abrupt tonal changes from cute to fantasy to manic to tragic made for a jarring and flat experience. These mood shifts were always accompanied by appropriate music signalling to the audience which emotion they were now supposed to dial in. I hate that kind of emotional manipulation from a director. Here it is clearly done to help the director tell their story because the film is failing to deliver on any coherent emotional or narrative level. To end the film with a quote from Rilke - ""no feeling is final"" - is a poor, unearned grasp at significance after almost two hours of mediocre film making. I have no idea why this film garnered the attention and writing awards that it did."
JOJO RABBIT,24 March 2020,8/10,"It may be the most tearjerking comedy of the year. Outstanding comedy, always has a sad core; Outstanding tragedy, always have to make you laugh with the magic of tears. It's not a novel way to start from a child's point of view, but the movie still USES this method, with its childlike laughter, to depict war so realistically and love so movingly."
JOJO RABBIT,17 April 2020,8/10,"When ""beautiful life"" meets ""moonrise kingdom,"" a warm and sad anti-war fairy tale. The first half is as colorful as wes Anderson, the second half gently RIPS open the sugar-coated reality. Not only the most harmless Hitler in the history of film, but also the most popular widow. Be a qiaoqiao rabbit and experience the beauty and horror of human nature."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,9/10,"And just liked that Jojo Rabbit managed to make me roar with laughter and broke my heart in the same time. This is not exactly a feel good film, but it has a big big heart and it was like putting on a safety blanket while watching abd being reminded about the horrors and cruelty humans are capable of, and also how ridiculous yet corrupting Nazism, racism, and white supremacy can be. Shout out to Roman Griffith Davis as one of the best protagonist of the year, Thomasin McKenzie as his foil, Taika Waititi as imaginary Hitler, Sam Rockwell as the conflicted and jaded Nazi captain, and especially to Scarlett Johanson as the brave, funny, beautiful, and all around good person Rosie Jojo's mother. I can't wait to see it again."
JOJO RABBIT,5 September 2021,10/10,"Jojo is a 10yearold boy, who lives alone with his mother near the end of WWII, his father is fighting for the fatherland in Italy, and his imaginary friend is an uncharacteristically wholesome Hitler that helps him cope with everyday life in a world that makes no sense.Naturally this has caught lot of peoples panties in a twist, as the plot can be difficult to fathom if all you have to distinguish in the world is Good and Bad, much like the nazis in the movie simply see the world through a lens of nazism and enemies of nazism.. I know who that reminds me of.. we've seen them the last 5 years demonizing their political enemies to the point violence against them is socially acceptable, nay encouraged, they are, after all, irredeemable deplorables and should be shunned from polite conversation and the public sphere!This is a mirror held up at the totalitarian minded people of today, you might wear a different band, and your salute might be a fist, but the ideals of social control are the same,.The Us that is flawless, and the Them that is evil, whose minds are controlled by the devil, and you'll find them in abundance trying to downplay the significance of the movie applying the single star rating because they either hate it or fail to understand it, much like Jojo.Sadly, the irony will be lost on them.The plot of the movie is uncomfortable, Jojo is an eager member of the hitler youth, which is portrayed similar to american camp lifestyle, with councillors who are there to prepare them for adulthood.So for boys to become men to (urgently) fight and die for the fatherland and girls to make beds and learn how to make babies.. ""what a time to be a woman!"", and it's very tongue in cheek perfectly executed.Jojo is revealed to be a coward, and is bullied by the older boys when he refuses to kill a rabbit, and this is where the title comes from, Jojo Rabbit.He runs away and is comforted by Imaginary Hitler, who does not see rabbits as a cowardly animal, but one that thrives despite its fuzzy demeanour. This drives him into a frenzied and unfortunate engagement with a hand grenade and his days prepping to die for the fatherland is cut short, leaving him scarred and somewhat crippled, and spending more time at home.But he is a curious boy, and stumbles across marks on the floor in his deceased sisters room, revealing a hidden chamber behind the walls where he meets Elsa, the jewish girl his mother has been hiding from him.And this is where the real story of the movie begins.Naturally being indoctrinated by society he is initially hesitant to engage with the Jew, which makes for some interesting cat and mouse play, where jojo invariably plays the reluctant mouse. Elsa is no fool, and the chemistry between them is something to behold!He can't confront his mother about it, because he is not supposed to know she is there, and he doesn't want his mother to get into trouble with the gestapo, as his father left him in charge to take care of her, which he takes very seriously.. and we are painted a very clear picture for what happens to traitors of the fatherland..
This takes us on a journey of discovery, as his prejudice of the jew is undressed, and they develop an unorthodox friendship, him during the day working for the jugend spreading propaganda for the Party, and spending his free time covertly pumping her for information of the Jew, which is simply adorable as she gleefully shares her devilishly imaginative secrets with him, that he eats up like the trusting child he is, and puts in his little book with graphic detail inbetween hating on Nathan, his rival and ultimate accomplice.Jojo Rabbit is a highly unorthodox coming of age movie, rich in subtle detail, excellent scenery, great music and timeless wisdom, and anyone with a semblance of love for freedom should watch it!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2020,5/10,"I'd like to ask all the other reviewers - really!?This is a movie which is neither serious, the writer clearly doesn't know much about wwii - nor that funny.If you've read the premise, that's honestly the funniest thing about this movie.. the premise.So what is the point in this film?"
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,1/10,"I think my title summed this up. I was expecting, with all the other positive reviews, something in the level of Mel Brooks. This was just plain improvised stupidity."
JOJO RABBIT,26 April 2020,2/10,"It is very difficult to make fun of real horrors, like to laugh about your child death....this is my feeling when I watch comedies about Holocaust! Folks it was something beyond your human imagination, just watch several documentaries on Auschwitz and Bergen-Belzen and say after it, I can lough about it ?!
The director with its Maori ancestry as well some Jewish parts (reed his brief biography) allowed himself to make a parody about these terrible times. By making so called parody, comedy from atrocities, we give them legacy like it was something funny and not a catastrophic event..I stop here, there is no sense to continue....what I am worried is those who gave it a 9 and a 10 mark like they are out of space (alien) with zero knowledge about the past."
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,5/10,"Good story, very well written screenplay but movie is disaster on two accounts.01. Casting is horrible, except for the two kids everyone else is misfit. Including Scarlet, i adore her but its not role for her.02. Poor Direction, just rushing through the screenplay, nothing else.An opportunity missed... By the half way it become too hard to bear..."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,8/10,"The movie's not bad, the story gets you going and the cast is good... Specially scarlett johansson and sam rockwell... both did brilliant.
but what makes this movie forgettable is that it's copied part by part from other movies I can remember.The romance between the two teens kinda reminded me of wes andreson's moonrise kingdom and the the nazi's part reminded me of tarantino's brilliant picture, inglourious basterds.Afterall, it is enjoyable and I do recommend you guys to watch it once."
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2020,10/10,"What a brilliant movie. Funny, touching, sad and poignant. Caught myself smiling during most of the film. Acting from all was amazing. Very highly recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,12 October 2019,10/10,"Not just funny, but hilarious. Yet--sad. Poignant. Beautifully acted--an amazing debut from young Roman Griffin Davis; Waititi as Adolf Hitler; Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson; Rebel Wilson; Stephen Merchant. Compassionate, loving, sensitive, along with being bust-a-gut comedy. Never would have thought of such an inspired gimmick, Adolf Hitler as an imaginary friend--but it works.Thank you, Taika Waititi!"
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,9/10,The clashing of comedy and tragedy sparks powerful emotion. Really great film
JOJO RABBIT,10 April 2020,7/10,"Sometimes when meet trouble thing,
escape is not a shameful thing.cutie actor - Roman Griffin Davis"
JOJO RABBIT,28 August 2020,10/10,"I didnt know if I should watch this movie as it makes no secrets about parodying WWII. I was in two minds about watching it at the cinema, so instead watched it at home when it was released. My gosh. What a strange, hilarious, weird, beautiful, emotional rollercoaster of a movie! NAZIs are made to look hilariously idiotic amongst the bitter sweet relationship of a hide away Jewish girl and a Hitler Youth fanatic boy in WWII. The atrocities are not glossed over. There are some deeply harrowing scenes, that are dealt with compassionately. But what I think the true story of this movie is, is that underneath we are all human and share the same emotions. Even NAZIs can feel compassion. What a truly uplifting, satirical, moving view on humanity. I'm glad I didnt see it in the cinema as I was a wreck at the end!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,10/10,"This is a beautiful story told in a beautiful manner with an absolutely wonderful ending. I am not a crier, but I could not help but let the emotions that just kept building up during the movie and peaked with the final scene turn into a minute or so of crying some tears of whatever goodness was affecting me by the time the credits began to roll. story just wrapped up so wonderfully.This movie is sometimes listed as a comedy and there are certainly fun and funny overtones for much that happens during it. As I saw it, this is really more of a human story told in a light and humorous manner, but it is the humanity that the characters fight to keep and learn to reunite with that matters most. Watchers get to enjoy seeing the lives of characters be saved by love, kindness and understanding through shared struggle and learning that hate solves nothing.My usual wrap-up for the movies I love: Awesome story, awesome writing, awesome acting, awesome everything.In my humble opinion, this is definitely a must watch. Certainly a 10/10 for this one."
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,9/10,"But here we are! Of course it's hilarious in a totally original way, Taika is spot-on with his idiot Hitler impression. But he also manages to show that much of the hate that people harbor for others, comes from a place of complete nonsense, and that by freeing your mind, a total sea change can occur. Scarlet Johansson also kills it as Jojo's incredibly kind mother."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"A single word can't do justice to this film but this is as close as you'll get. A hilarious satire full of heart and moments of gut-punching tragedy. Following movies such as 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Thor: Ragnarok', Taika Waititi has cemented his place as a master with 'Jojo Rabbit'. The writing is perfect and had me laughing throughout as well as my Mom who was still laughing while driving home at ""His face looks like a Picasso painting"", one of the many, many funny quotes throughout. Luckily she didn't crash and/or wet herself. Perhaps one of the funniest moments is Stephen Merchant's first scene, when an uproarious minute of ""Heil Hitler-ing"" takes place which includes a fantastic shot of Merchant towering over Sam Rockwell.
The performances are fantastic from top to bottom, from younger stars Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie, whose relationship develops very nicely, to veterans like Scarlett Johansson who balance comedy and emotion beautifully. Rockwell is a scene stealer as the closeted Nazi and earns our sympathy by the films end. Taika Waititi is outrageous as Hitler, getting to the point where Mom was on the verge of tears by his mere presence on screen.
For as funny as it is, the film isn't without its heart breaking moments. If you've seen the movie all I have to do is mention the shoes and you know what I'm talking about. It's a tragic moment that took my breath away. However, for a tone shift so drastic, it doesn't feel out of place thanks to Waititi's brilliant direction. When the German version of 'Heroes' kicks in at the end with a snap of Griffin Davis' fingers just before the credits roll, I knew I had just witnessed something special. A modern classic already."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,8/10,"Not what trailer says - way better, sometimes sad, sometimes fun. I was looking for the crazy stupid American humor but was surprised that the movie is actually something more. 8 solid stars- few stupid things like smoking- that time it was disgraceful to a German/Nazi Person to contaminate own body with it."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,9/10,"A well written, interesting roller coaster ride of comedy and emotion. One of the more enjoyable movies I have seen but also with characters in depth enough that you care about. A great movie throughout"
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,10/10,"I cried, it's fantastic. Theirs a twist that I wouldn't dare to spoil. It's funny when it needs to be and sorrow when it needs to be. The fact that this came out of Disney is wild to me. I can't say to much without spoiling the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,10/10,Excellent acting in a funny yet tragic story. I love Taika Waititi's works so much and this one is no exception. This is the kind of movie I could watch anytime.
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,"This film is the perfect mix of funny and thoughtful. It highlights both the ridiculous nature of the Nazi regime as well as the very real sad consequences of it.
The two young actors who play the lead characters are fantastic. The character of Hitler is absolutely hilarious too and is played by the chap who made the film.
The Soundtrack is pretty good also with German version of classic pop songs.
All round very good film!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 December 2019,10/10,"First off this movie is just amazing from the 1 second of the movie to the last second as it is able to portray war while still being able to be a hilarious and happy movie as it is able to keep comedy all while exposing some of the disturbing truths about war and patriotism i also have to say this movie had some of the best acting I have seen in awhile as the actors are able to portray their characters in a very realistic light while not going to over the top with it but just having fun with their role which in turn creates this masterpiece of a movie that feels like it was directed by someone like Quentin Tarantino except if it was pg13 of course but still it's able to do all of that and more as it also has some very funny scenes and some very sad tearjerker Esque scenes not to mention that this movie is able to combine the horrors of war like that of hacksaw ridge the coming of age of a teen movie like stephen Kings it the comedy of something like parks and recreation all while having amazing actor chemistry intense scenes and extremely hysterically dumb humor throughoutOne last thing I have to say is a recommend this for more 13 year olds and I know most people will disagree but some of the scenes are a little bit much as this movie contains most of its characters being killed in very disturbing fashions like hangings and being shot offscreen but still disturbing as you have come to know these characters quite well doin my opinion I would say wait till 13 or at least 12 to watch
All in all I give this review a.... 11 OUT OF TEN"
JOJO RABBIT,6 November 2019,5/10,"Jojo Rabbit (2019)This is a movie that seems controversial, because it takes a chance with an overt invocation of Nazi Germany in a sympathetic setting. On fact, this movie has nothing to do with Nazis, Hitler or history, other than because of that history, various signs and symbols are part of our world heritage.It takes about 1/2 the movie to discover that it is going to take no chances beyond juxtaposing Leni Riefenstahl newsreel footage with the Beatles singing in German. It dispenses with this bold gambit in the opening few minutes, taking the idea nowhere. But forgive yourself for thinking it might try to develop the idea.Yes, this movie milks caricatures related to Nazis. No it's not a big deal. It's a cartoon, true to the Thor: Ragnarok pedigree of its creator.Taika Waititi just wants to make a movie about adolescent love and the fear everyone rightly has about being included or excluded in a society that makes no sense, maybe largely because a society steeped in American movies and television makes no sense.A goofy marionette doll made up to be Hitler is the imaginary friend of Jojo, a 10 year old German Boy Scout, at the edge of puberty. Think Harvey the Wonder Rabbit. A cute caricature of Anne Frank becomes his girlfriend.If you are not old enough to be averse to the exploitation of the Third Reich for comedic-tragic purposes--The Producers (1967), anyone--you will be charmed by a well-photographed and carefully designed set piece, most likely created by Wes Anderson's production team in their off-time when he's doing animated features.Nothing happens except that two kids fall in love under the auspices of personal tragedy. The dynamics of this go unexplored. I think Waititi means well, though his insights don't range any farther than open admonishments to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with life in spite of its emotional vicissitudes. And with a perky cheerful vibe.Does the world need an upbeat lozenge about the Holocaust? After seeing the re-release of Mr. Klein (1976) I didn't reject this wacky sojourn. It's well acted. Its talent is given little to do but they make the best of it. The relationships portrayed are simplistic and one-dimensional, but not tacky. It is full of oddly good cheer, somehow obliterating the sense of how dark, morbid and grey the human experience often can be. We all know what's gonna happen: Allied Americans are gonna kick some Nazi ass and parade around with the Red, White and Blue, then Trump is gonna be re-elected. Freedum: ""Learn it, love it, live it"" as some golf nerd played by Chevy Chase once told his caddy. ""da-da-da-da-da..."" (Putt) ""De-de-de-de-de...."" (Putt). That's as far as this goes; sinking close putts with one hand on the iron.And I didn't really wish for anything else to happen. The kid, his mom, and Anne Frank are all super appealing people, Sam Rockwell is a crank with a heart-of-gold, and Hitler is a goofball, designed to be annoying.I don't see any comparison of this with Life if Beautiful (1997). I like this better. But the Begnini movie had an odd irony, noted by cultural critic S. Zizek, that while we are supposed to be moved by Begnini's efforts to protect the spirit of the boy, convincing him that everything happening in the concentration camp is part of an elaborate rouse, the boy in fact knows that he's being duped but plays along to protect the feelings of his caretaker, just as children pretend to believe in Santa Clause to humor their parents and get presents. But this uncanny quality doesn't exist within the Begnini movie itself. It had to be observed from without. There's probably no such irony possible with Jojo Rabbit.This is the boundary of the uncanny which Jojo Rabbit somehow steadfastly avoids, amounting to nothing more than an emotional device to remind us love hurts. ""It's like Ghost meets the Mabchurian Candidate, but it's got a heart... that's in the right spot."" You'll learn little except a couple of R. M. Rilke quotes.Anybody who has ever been discriminated against--which is pretty much everybody who went to high-school--will identify with the vilification of the unwanted other. Why this has to be couched in the horror of WWII Germany, I have no idea, except that's all close to being forgotten because everyone who was there has passed. Yes, the legacy lives on. But what does this movie have to do with it?Try looking up ""billy wilder death mills"" on Youtube to become connected to a bit of what the era of the Allied victory actually looked like. Then forget about Jojo Rabbit as having any bearing on history.BTW--Jojo Rabbit gets his name in a manner directly lifted from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Watch that movie and consider how the memory-hole of Hollywood plies the collective mind.Enjoyable fare that's more empty than it seems, but is so darn heartfelt you may not mind. It was OK with me."
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,9/10,"A quick overview on what this movie is, well it is indeed a satire comedy regarding the Nazi regime taking place towards the end of the war. This is such a heartfelt movie with clever humour that hits you right at the core due to the of course one and only Taika Waititi. However, at it's core it tells a story that I think has been a trend these days which is an anti-war movie which doesn't shove it in your face like a certain Maleficent: Mistress of Evil did but instead it shows it through the lens of a child and the effect it has on the people around the child.So, beginning with the acting, I think everybody absolutely nailed their role within the movie and they were all incredibly outstanding and this includes those given supporting roles within the movie. However, the spotlight is on the three main characters which are Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), and Rosie Betzler (Scarlett Johannson) whom were all well flashed out characters in which the incredible screenplay by the director/actor, Taika Waititi together with their incredible acting talent gives the audience an opportunity to love these characters where each significant moment within the movie provides an impactful impact whilst experiencing this movie through and through. Roman Griffin Davis to me is a rising star in the movie industry and with so much talent at such a young age, he is definitely one to watch in the future. Furthermore, Thomasin McKenzie whom starred in another movie I watched, The King, was also great in the film but just in case you have not seen the later trailers, I shall stop there regarding her role within the movie.Another thing which is kind of related to the acting but not really would be the chemistry amongst the main stars which brings a heartfelt performance to the screen. Shockingly, you actually grow to have a liking towards a certain Sam Rockwell towards the end of the movie which is something odd as he portrays a nazi. But hey, that shows the power of screenwriting and amazing characters.Another thing I adored about this movie is obviously, the cinematography, this movie looks gorgeous, especially the colour gradient in every scene; from the cozy colours within the confines of the house, to the beautiful coulouful town of well Praque to be fair but yes. It's just so well filmed. A scene in particular that I grew a fond off is the scene whereby Jojo looks through what is a cardboard cutout and I thought that scene looked beautiful.All in all, the movie is really funny with some hits at the Nazi ideology and how ridiculous they were, I believe that the best way to show that you do not fear an individual is by making fun of them as nobody is scared of an individual that is a joke to everyone in the room; which I think is what Taika Waititi mentioned within an interview he did regarding the movie but I can't seem to find the quote but yes, this statement is absolutely correct and this movie does not deserve the bashing it got from certain critics in which this is the same issue many had when it came to critics condemning Joker.So, yet again a well deserved Oscar award to Mr. Taika Waititi, it is an amazing movie with a really good adapted screenplay whic technically brought me to tears a couple of times. Just pure good stuff."
JOJO RABBIT,30 May 2020,10/10,Wow! The acting in this is first class. The story is great. Something. So original and one of the best films I've seen in a while.
JOJO RABBIT,10 March 2020,9/10,"A beautifully shot masterpiece with some of the best acting I've seen in a movie in a while. it has some of the most emotional scenes I've ever seen in a movie as well as some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It is a perfect mix of comedy and drama that works well because of the amazing acting. If I had one issue with the movie it was that JoJo stabbing Elsa was never mentioned again after it happened. It seems like an important plot point but then they just sort of forgot about it. Overall, it is an amazing masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is an anti-hate satire,but that also treats the context in which it takes place with respect and solemnity."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,9/10,"It's hard to define the genre of Taika Watiti's JoJo Rabbit, it's a comedy, drama, War story and sort of satire rolled into one.
The film shifts from having actors play over the top caricatures of nazi stereotypes to a tense stand-off between the SS and a Jewish girl pretending to be German to avoid certain death.
Sprinkled through this mashup of genres is Taika's daring style, for a film set in 1940s Germany there's plenty of colour, slow motion and visual humour. The script has an almost improvised feel to it, with some actors verging onto a cartoonish feel, however fans of his work so far should know what to expect.
The stand out performances for me where Scarlett Johansson as JoJo's mother. A face of optimism in Germany's approaching defeat and the voice of reason for our main character. Taika himself plays Adolf Hitler, well JoJos imaginary friend version of Adolf Hitler. He mainly provides absurd comic relief with his whacky behaviour.
There's enough sublte references to the Nazi regime that will provide the extra laughs for the keen eyed, however JoJo Rabbit's story gradually shifts at such a pace that it catches you off guard when the genre goes into a more serious drama. The humour is still there but there's only so long a family hiding a Jew in Germany before the repercussions come forward.
Overall this movie is a definite watch, part comedy part drama sprinkled with Taika Watiti's wonderful originality."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,9/10,Taika Waititi is a brilliant film maker and absolutely hilarious. Outstanding cast. Highly recommended.
JOJO RABBIT,9 August 2020,3/10,"Over rated on a politically correct forced scriptNot the better approach over Nazi topicGood, if you want to see how they suppose a child could view the problem living in it, but there a lot of better approach on the topic"
JOJO RABBIT,19 March 2020,6/10,"This is why I rarely watch mainstream movies today: it's because they are cartoonish versions of more serious movies. Like this movie, ""Jojo"", which portrays Berlin at the end of ww2 as a dreamy, romantic place - let me break it to you: it was not. Berlin at the end of ww2 was all in rubble, you couldn't find stone standing on another stone, and people were starving. There weren't any postcard-like streets where you can dance and dream.So you really have to wonder why don't people rather watch Rossellini's 1948 movie ""Germany Year Zero"" which is also about a boy in Berlin, although immediately after the war, facing grim reality of destroyed Berlin and whole German nation? And the answer is that that movie is too grim for today's audience, they need watered down and cartoony version of that movie - and that is very disturbing."
JOJO RABBIT,8 December 2020,8/10,I was really suprised with this movie. I thougt it would only be a comedy but it has a great mix of comedy and tragedy. the tragedy parts come unexpected and make you feel really sad and the next moment you will start laughing again.The acting in this movie was really good and especially from the younger actors. It makes the movie even better.
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,1/10,"Humor can be an excellent way to escape from terrible things. Humor is also a legitimate way of escaping terrible things. Yet there are terrible things you don't have to joke about. For example, it would be completely unnecessary to make jokes about how people die in gas chambers. The makers of Jojo Rabbit not only present jokes about, for example, children who blow themselves up: they are also bad jokes and that is unforgivable. Jojo Rabbit becomes painful in 2 ways: because painful facts are raised and because bad jokes are made about it. The drama in the film does not work either. If I am presented with funny Nazis in one scene, how can I believe a scene later that they hang people? The presence of Scarlett Johansson is a complete mystery to me. If I were her I would take another agent. The production probably had too much budget."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,9/10,"I saw a preview of JoJo Rabbit months ago and wrote it off as art house remainder bin, but when my life changed recently and I needed to see a movie that might shake me up I thought ""Why not?"" From the first shot it reminded me of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (2012), that I loved, and it spread out and deepened up to the last scene. Sure, it's goofy, but life is goofy. Just look at our current politics (and political leaders). Every personality in this movie is over the top, which makes it an anti-documentary that rings more true than not. The child protagonist reminded me of The Kid in Charlie Chaplin's movie of that name. Sadly, there was only one other person in the audience at today's suburban afternoon weekday matinee. The tone of JoJo Rabbit won't be everyone's cup of tea but I encourage every slightly bent, broken, or discouraged movie goer to roll the dice and see this minor masterpiece. If your choice is either JoJo Rabbit or a presidential rally, fellow citizens choose life over death."
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2021,10/10,"I throughly enjoyed this movie.The characters have a beautiful depth.It's brilliantly written and directed.It shows the dark idiotic extremes of the era,the propaganda driven BS that tore the world apart.It's filled with some hilarious moments,some really heartbreaking scenes, but it's all part of what I can safely say,is one best movies I've seen in years.I wish I'd watched it sooner.Thank you Mr Waititi."
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"One of the most well made movies I have ever seen. The acting by the young man was just awesome. There were parts where you laughed hysterically and then cried. As years move on, this movie will be looked upon as a masterpiece. Should have been nominated for best picture."
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2020,10/10,"This movie gave me the ""La vita e bella"" vibes! What a journey! A complex of feelings, going from sadness to happiness and back and forth. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. The main character was just a delight and so talented he will definitely be a future star. I also loved Johansson in this movie, she was admirable, charming, delightful and carefree.
I think we needed this perspective of viewing the past events, since it is necessary to move on and make peace with our history. We do not have any other choice besides acceptance and letting go."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,2/10,"Totally stupid movie, couldn't watch beyond 30 minutes. Only gave it an extra star for Scarlett Johannson."
JOJO RABBIT,22 March 2020,1/10,"I haven't reviewed a movie in a while but I'm making an exception for this. I'm just old enough to have known many people who lived through the horror of Nazi Germany and people who fought to bring an end to the Third Reich. And knowing what I know all I can say is this movie is nausea inducing. EVERYTHING about it. The fact this gets made, let alone received critical accolades astonishes me."
JOJO RABBIT,7 March 2020,10/10,"You will laugh, you will dance, you will celebrate, you will cry and you will be amazed. I have seen such an wonderful movie after so many days, and it deserved more oscars ( got only 1). Definitely watch the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,22 May 2020,8/10,"Films are often made about America/Britain/Japan during WW2 .
Here, it is Germany. And as I said already, it isn't a war movie. The genre here is Comedy, Drama, although it wasn't a comedy everytime.
A boy named Jojo in Hitler's Germany, dreams of becoming a soldier in Hitler's regime. However, soon he discovers, he doesn't have 'that' , what it takes to become a merciless soldier. His second discovery is a Jew girl in his attic. Now to know how she went there, and what happened afterwards, you need to watch the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,25 August 2020,6/10,"I was looking forward to this movie, unfortunately it was over promoted and fell very flat on some key moments that could have been very clever and funny. I kept expecting a punch line, then the scene was over. Some of the humor was almost too cliche, that wasn't really funny.They should have had Noah Taylor play Adolf Hitler, see tv Series ""Preacher."" All through the movie I kept thinking, this was something Wes Anderson should have done. After watching ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" I was hoping Jojo Rabbit was going to be as funny, witty, serious, charming, and delightful, but it wasn't.There were plenty of opportunities to expand the supporting characters with more humor. Most of the supporting cast was mute, where there was again missed opportunity to make this movie stick.The serious moments toward the end were good, but it didn't do the first 3/4 of the movie justice. The kids who played their roles did a great job, but I feel the lead role of Jojo's script was lacking. Either too much fear, or not enough depth to his character. His mother's script and role just didn't fit into any of that, which threw off his character.Sam Rockwell as the Captain, his role was by far the best, and made the whole movie. The choice in music was not a good match and lessened it to a degree of just being all over the place and didn't fit.I wanted to enjoy this movie, but all I could think of was that it fell flat, and was overall disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,8/10,"This film was funny (if a bit silly at times), heartwarming and heartbreaking. I laughed and I cried. I going to steer clear of any major spoilers so any I do give will only be ones that you would have already known if you've seen the trailer
My friend is a huge fan of the director and she was desperate to see this film, so we went and saw it as a last thing to do before she was going away for a while. Anyway. I went with middle expectations. I was presently surprised. I had listened to the radio four Saturday review of it and so was expecting the film to be silly. I was actually surprised. I laughed out loud on a number of occasions. And cried as well.The humour was well done. Not to slapstick but not too subtle. They did it well. You didn't feel guilty for laughing at the nazi-ism or at the accident.Scarlett Johansson:
She was advised as the main big name in the film. In reality she wasn't in it much to begin with. She was a bit in the middle (good crotch kick Rosie!!) and none at the end. Scarlett was up to her usual standard of fabulous acting and is always a delight to watch her portraying strong but real women. Good performance!Rebel Wilson:
I was excited to see that she was in this film as I like her. In reality I think she had about 7 short lines. She was hardly in it at all. (Tho when she was she added a lot to the humour!) she was Hilarious and brilliant as always. Good performance!The main boy (can't remember his name):
Stunning performance!! Really really well acted! What more can I say?! Gave the film the touch of reality that I neededLeader of the hitler youth (can't remember his name either)
Lovely touch. Good character.Hitler (and director and writer)
Good. Nothing special in my opinion. But the comedy on his part was a little tooooo exaggerated imoElsa. Lovely girl. Loved herOverall a good film. Would recommend! (Bring tissues and don't make the mistake I did and wear no waterproof makeup) a good film!!"
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,9/10,"The ending drags a bit, but it's still great and you should watch it THE CONTROVERSY DOESNT MATTER"
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,7/10,"Of cause we love Sam's acting, enhances every movie he involved. But this time two little boys are really eye catching,I really love the styling, outfits for Scarlett is chic with a touch of that era, even the Jewish girl outfit, they put afford on it.Story is simple and lovely, a bit like Disneyland tale, good to have other emotion to talk about the dark era other than extreme sadness."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,1/10,"My wife took me to this movie saying the reviews were great. Now I know better. Seems from all the 10/10s people were giving this movie, on the surface it might be a really good movie. After all, it was nominated four times, and won all four awards. NOT! Did these people watch the same movie my wife and I did??? Perhaps their humor is significantly different than ours!? Or, the brilliant reviews given now prove to me the world has actually gone mad. I've only walked out of two movies in my entire life. After 45 minutes, my wife asked me if I wanted to leave. And we did! What a freaking disappointment. Don't waste your money! See another movie..."
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,1/10,"This would be a full minus 10. No humor. Just stupidity. I fear those giving it a plus 10 represent the dumbing down of America's youth. The director/writer, and Fox Searchlight movies, should be ashamed of making such a useless unfunny travesty."
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,10/10,"I was a bit skeptical about this one, but that quickly changed in the first moments of the movie and I have just witnessed one of the most amazing modern movie masterpieces!A comedy with a deep message and a sad, hard, tearful story is told.
OR
A tear dropping drama of a story that is brought to you with such a light and well executed comedy.
I don't know which one, but this was one hell of an emotional roller-coaster of a movie!AMAZING"
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2021,8/10,Incredible cast. The performance was outstanding and the movie was beautiful.
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"Finally a great movie! I almost lost any hope for a great movie from Hollywood, and there it is!
This scriptwriter is a genius. The acting is perfect, the little boy and girl acts better than most of the highest paid actors in Hollywood.
This movie touches every emotion you can feel, and you will feel them.
A great satire that teaches you that we are all human beings. We are the same. We can have a better world full of happiness and dancing!
The end is right on spot, laughed with tears.
GO AND WATCH IT!!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"Whilst I respect the view of people that don't like the move I'd expect them to see more than just the trailer. It's a great movie that portraits the Germans in a less favourable light so I couldn't stop laughing, despite being German, in particular Adolf as the hero's best friend, in the young mans mind of course.Moments of laughter are followed by sucker punch like moments of despair and sadness, but the essence for me is like the end of ""The Life of Brian"" always look at the bright side of life. A beautiful happy-sad movie."
JOJO RABBIT,27 July 2020,9/10,"As the American great-granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, this movie moved me to tears. I've never felt so compelled to review a film. It is a sparkling inspiration, a reminder of humanity while very clearly acknowledging the evil that reigned. It made me laugh, too, (director Taika Waititi is brilliant) which helped make this not a dark film to watch - despite depicting the horror of the times.Visuals were fantastic. The music - both song and soundtrack - was BRILLIANT. And the actors were incredible. I think Scarlett Johansson took the spotlight (and it helped knowing she herself is Jewish! As is Waititi) but Roman Griffin Davis (the protagonist) and Thomasin McKenzie (a Jewish girl in hiding) really brought justice to the many souls their characters represented.Above all, the writing was spot-on. Johansson's determination to show her son humanity at a time when being human was dangerous. Her courage and sacrifice. McKenzie's declaration that NO JEW IS WEAK while she struggles to find life in her dangerous hideout. And a German captain's last brave stand (played by the marvelous Sam Rockwell).All the little moments and big exclamations - this movie should be screened in all schools across the world."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,9/10,"Any other movie that tries or has ever tried to make a comedy out of being a Nazi in WWII has, or will, inevitably fail. It SHOULD be impossible. There should be no way to take that kind of subject matter and treat it with the respect it deserves, while also maintaining a lighthearted, comedic tone. But this, this actually does it flawlessly. Some of the humor isn't even that dark, and it still works consistently.Now don't get me wrong, this movie gets pretty hard to watch. Really hard to watch at times.And yet, right up until the end, it never loses it's audience or goes TOO deep into the dark stuff. It masterfully walks a tightrope between the horrors of war/Nazi-ism on one side, and a child coming of age on the other, with Taika Watiti's signature brand of weird comedy weaved throughout. Honestly I think it could even be a solid introduction for children who don't know about WWII, it's that good.The performances are fantastic across the board, the dialogue is brilliant, the cinematography has some great moments, etc. In conclusion, it's good, go watch it. Especially if you're a Nazi."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"Cinema is not dead. Feature film has the opportunity to engage us emotionally and Jojo Rabbit delivers on all fronts. It is humorous, profound and moving. We were crying in the theatre and at times after we left it. It is beautiful, thoughtful and the performances are outstanding. Clever!"
JOJO RABBIT,25 October 2019,8/10,"This is fantastic Political Satire; we need to be able use Satire in the correct way and Waititi did just that. If you think this movie is offensive here is Satires definition:Satire
1 a literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn
2 trenchant wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly"
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,9/10,"This was such a thrill. I enjoyed every single moment of this film. Suberb acting, fantastic shots, amazing screenplay and overall a fantastic film!"
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,With Jojo Rabbit Taika Waititi gives us a heart-rending comedy about a ten-year German during the last days of WWII. The film is delightfully goofy - Taika kills it as JoJo's imaginary friend Adolph Hitler - but then hits you hard with the true horrors of the Nazi regime. Jojo Rabbit is a wonderful satire supported by a brilliant cast.
JOJO RABBIT,5 September 2021,4/10,The director will try to suggest he has family links to this content - that it is a new direction that cannot be offensive because it is part of his genetic makeup. Truth is he thought this would draw attention and could be marketed as 'cutting edge' - 'black comedy' - pushing the limits of acceptance and humour. The 'big business' marketing team thought the same...the award shows received their bribes. The audience was supposed to be excited for this 'new name full of potential director'. Instead we saw another talented director sell out his potential to supposedly 'be famed'. Not a memorable effort - we walked out during the movie. Nothing to do with the story line topic but everything to do with marketing bucket level dribble.
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a film which will make you laugh and cry. It's a comedy which, while set during such serious real life events, It isn't really offensive. The acting is very good, the child actors pull such convincing performances, Roman Griffin Davis (Jojo) and Archie Yates (Yorki) have such good performances for child actors, and Scarlet Johanson is phenomenal as Jojo's mother. It's not going to be in everybody's taste, but it's worth giving it a try."
JOJO RABBIT,18 April 2020,9/10,Great way of expressing the terrors of war through a comedy perfect in every way imaginable
JOJO RABBIT,30 November 2020,9/10,It is a weird spin on a war time piece done in a comedy way but it really works there is moments where I laughed out loud and moments where I cried something this film was really good at doing was catching my emotions and then letting them go with a bit of comedy but overall it is really good the acting is great from scarlet johanson and the plot very good if you haven't watched this yet I definitely would put it on your watch list
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2020,10/10,Good movie. The graphic is awesome and the story is touching.
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2020,8/10,"I've only seen this once, but it's such a unique, deep, moving story with great acting and great comedy, and also great moments of incredible despair and heartbreak. The ONLY reason it's 8/10 for me is because the tone shifts from crazy serious to slapstick with little transition. Other than that, which can be a little annoying only at times, amazing movie."
JOJO RABBIT,30 August 2021,10/10,"Gut wrenching comedy, this is a masterpiece of a movie. I laughed and I cried like crazy this movie has a blade that was eating for the right moment to just stab you in the heart, the foreshadowing of the movie is great and the cinematography is also beautiful."
JOJO RABBIT,30 August 2020,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect after seeing the trailers, but it went beyond expectations. I was blown away with the dynamic of such a serious topic, interlaced with comedy, incredible script, perfect casting, view from a child's perspective that sums up the worst and best of humanity."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"In England after the hyper madness which is Christmas comes the depressing month that is January and with it follow all the Oscar bait movies from America most of which are drama's and frequently in themselves depressing. Lucky for us this year Taika Waitit has thrown his name into the Oscar hat bringing out a comedy about the Hitler Youth... That doesn't sound like a comedy at all, leave it to the man behind the greatest Thor film ever (which is somewhat damming with faint praise) to find the balance between The Boy In Striped Pajamas and the play The Producers were trying to make.... So the reel question does this man Mine Kampf for Waititi?Taika is a unique writer, he seems to have an ability in finding whit in the most obscure places, take What We Do In The Shadows for example, there have been countless movies spoofing and mocking the legend of Dracula and Vampires in general but few take the unique perspective of Taika. He is a man without compare, this is where we find Jojo Rabbit a film more about love and hope than an imaginary friend.The challenge that Jojo Rabbit faces before it even begins is how funny can it be before it loses meaning? It's simple to mock the Nazis it's complicated to do so in a way that will keep the gravity of war in mind and ultimate pathos for the film, here is where Waititi shows his true genius. Jojo Rabbit while seemingly easy-going is just methodical in pacing all buildings for the ultimate sucker punch. Which I'm not ashamed to say brought tears to my eyes.Jojo Rabbit has tension without ever being too serious. This is where Taika comes into his own, he uses Hitler as the joke, then add in that Taika plays the leader of the 3rd Reich personally and you have a recipe for success.I cannot stress to you enough the power which Jojo Rabbit holds inside itself, this a is a movie far closer to Shindler's List than The Great Dictator, is it bold, unique and truly beautiful. Some of the simplest sequences are the most graceful; there is just something about watching Jojo ride his bike along a country road with his mum that I could happily watch for hours.It would be stating the obvious to say that all the actors bring some of their most talented work to Jojo, so instead, I will speak about the headline character himself... Jojo. Roman Griffin Davis has a long and bright career in front of him, he can use abilities it takes actors decades to master already. Simple outstanding.Jojo Rabbit is proof that Waititi isn't just the future of the film industry but the right now too. Jojo is a beautiful blend of both hilarity and heartbreak. Hail Waititi!10 Mind Reading Jews out of 10"
JOJO RABBIT,24 July 2020,9/10,"This movie must become part of high school curriculum along with the history of the nazis.
If you don't understand this movie, you don't know your history. Shows how silly talk about "" race"" can get. Facts make room for propaganda and a scapegoat is chosen."
JOJO RABBIT,19 April 2020,3/10,"Starting with English speaking actors playing Germans, everything about this movie is offensively hollow because it asks the viewers to be on its side on the easiest of all moral standards. Its satire and comedy are painfully wrought. In the end there is nothing but banality."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2021,3/10,"I did laugh once, right near the end a quick ""ha!"" and that was it. The attempts at humour throughout really only highlighted the absurdity of war and unfounded hatred, the inanity of propaganda. I felt the subject matter was just too ugly to make into a comedy. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but it was the emotional ride a movie should be. I am glad I watched it because I had heard so much about it but I would not encourage another person to bother with it."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,6/10,Looking for cute easy watch? This would be great. Nice colour palette that reminds me of Wes Anderson's work.
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,7/10,"It's an undeniably enjoyable watch. I kind of wish though that Jojo's imaginary Hitler friend had more of an impact on his decision-making throughout the film and brought about more conflict in his choices, rather than mostly being a passive gimmick for comedy purposes. Additionally, there's a few story beats that undeniably make little sense (even with suspension of disbelief) and some surface level historical inaccuracies, both of which took me out of the film a bit.
For example:Jojo has a grenade blow up next to him. He's rushed to hospital, and comes out with nothing but a lightly scarred face. Got off pretty lucky there with all his limbs and facial features intact...Hitler continuously offers Jojo cigarettes, when in reality Hitler was quite heavily against smoking and ran anti-tobacco campaigns.After Jojo's mother gets executed, he's just left living on his own and fending for himself. Pretty sure in reality the Nazi police would immediately follow up on the fact that Rosie has a young son and quickly raid her home and take the boy. I think a totalitarian government would definitely notice this 11 year old boy's presence...Also, I'm not too sure if Nazi Germany's town centres even had public hangings, but correct me if I'm wrong there.On the flipside though, Rosie's death was particularly effective, and was probably the most memorable and emotional scene in the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,6/10,"I know history very well and I really can laugh (and cry) when I see these kind of educational films with a brilliant twist.
Must admit I got so bored the first 20 minutes, i stopped watching. I'll give it another try."
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2019,10/10,"I saw Jojo Rabbit on Zagreb Film Festival yesterday and together with the audience I enjoyed the movie so much, in short every scene of this movie was great! Sadly today this is such a rare thing to see. First I was so happy to see Taika's new movie coming out that I didn't care so much what was it about. And what a beautiful surprise it was. Funny, smart, amazing Wes Anderson style shots, superb acting (expecially children) with a strong anti-war and human message and great/original soundtrack! If anyone has any issues with the way this movie is portraying things or characters, please don't. This movie as funny and original, also carries a deep and truthful message that I didn't expect it will take me back to my childhood in the beginning of the 90' when we had a war here in Croatia and I was a 10 year old boy. The war was so much occupying our childsplay, we even had notebooks with cut out newspaper pictures we would glue in, with our leader on the front page (the father of the nation) and war scenes of solders, commandos and war legends, with stupid (demagogic) sentences we would write below, looking up to our heroes of light fighting the enemy from the dark side. Like in the movie that enemy was the devil to us and normally you learn to hate them. And that was just a part of our everyday play and conversations. Innerly I knew and probably wasn't the only one, that emotions and behaviour of hate that the war brings out in people was wrong and disturbing, far from our pure child's naivety and nature. But what do children know how to act or express...we did our roles like others around us. Today these notebooks look sad to me and that is the point of this movie, with wars everybody loses, children especially. Tough the WW2 was decades ago, the strong humane message this film carries is needed for today's world. It emphesizes what we should never forget and that is a fact that we live in propably the best human era in history and it's is very important to look how beautiful our world is. And it's the richness of culture that undoubtedly every nation has is exactly what naturally brings differences and people together oppose to (ilusionist) ideologies that brainwash, blind and block the true human nature and result with the opposite effect of walls of prejudices that divides us. And that is exactly what we should always remember and teach our children so they can one day teach their children and so on.. Another strong point of the movie is that it shows the heros in a subtle way. We all need them, children especially and in the wars where everything gets upside down anyway, the term hero easily becomes controversial depending from which side you see them. Here it starts with the most controversial ""hero"" for a child to look up to, but ends with the true hero in anybody's life and that is the mother. And she's not the only one. All who suffer and refuse to give up, find the strength to go through and all those who help and support them get to be the hero. I love it. Powerful and needed today. Go and see this movie, you will not regret it."
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,7/10,"I think the movie is more like a comedy. The people commenting like i laughed and I cried probably have got a very low IQ . Good movie 6,5"
JOJO RABBIT,24 April 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi should have won best director for this hand down, No one can do a movie like that , when you start watching it you have fun, you laugh, you cry, you get enraged, you pass through the entire emotional spectrum It's shocking and it's calming at the same time,Heartwarming and Heartbreaking,It shows you that no matter how dark and difficult it will get, you will pull through,I can't remember the last time I was affected by a movie that much, for someone to make you go through all of this in one movie.......... well he has to be a genius. Performances by the entire cast were spectacular,Needless to say that everything is just perfect,Why are you even reading this? Just go and see it for yourself,Then you will know what you have been missing!!!!!!!!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,10/10,So hilarious were the funny moments that the sombre moments were made all the more tragic and heart-shattering. This allows you to understand the message even clearer. A perfect example of how to do Brectian theatre on the big screen. Just amazing . Taika is a god.
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,,"So-hot-right-now comedy wunderkind Taikia waititi jumps straight in the deep end with ""JoJo Rabbit"", about a young boy who wants to join the German army at the tail end of World War 2. Terrible timing aside, after an accident at his Hitler youth summer camp, JoJo discovers his mother is secretly harbouring a young Jewish girl, as the allies advance. What will Jojo do? And would you react if your imaginary best friend was Adolf Hitler?A comedy like this requires a delicate balance - sympathy for young German soldiers, nazi tropes about Jews played for laughs, a few emotional deaths to remind us of the horrors of the situation.. there's a reason there's very few successful war comedies told from the losing side. Thankfully Taikia is skillful enough to keep it all moving, emotional where required and above all, keep it all funny.Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen stand out as the debauched youth camp leaders who can see the writing on the wall, as does Archie Yates, the best example of a 10 year old boy playing a 50 year old British man playing a 10 year old boy, ever. Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is fine as JoJo, and Scarlett Johansson is above her average performance as JoJo's mother.
JoJo doesn't always blend comedy and emotion as smoothly as it could, but that's nitpicking really - this is a brilliant concept that's right up Taikias alley. While a plot description might give some pause, don't think twice, this is really something special - a funny, original movie that may even get us to see things in a different light.
BenWatch It Wombat"
JOJO RABBIT,31 July 2020,9/10,"An outstanding movie with an equally calculated amount of comedy and tragedy.
One among the few movies that can cause tears to weld up in your etes"
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,10/10,Every other second I was laughing and then horrified at what was truly happening and the balance between the two was flawless. It was so funny but more than anything it was smart.
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"The perspective of looking at war is innovative and original. Comedies with war theme are rare, but Jojo Rabbit did a good job. Truth is conveyed through innocence and humanity still shines in the blood-splattered slaughterhouse.
The acting has reached the peak of excellency. Sam Rockwell's performance impressed me again after The Three Billboards. The young actors all put effort in their performances, and their are definitely super talented.
The twist offers the audience quite a ride. While watching it in the cinema, I could feel the shock in the air as the whole place, packed with people, fell dead silent."
JOJO RABBIT,8 May 2020,8/10,"After watching this movie, I felt as if children are rarely given the time to see the beauty of the world. They are given very less time to use what truly belongs to them. In this movie too, the children are brainwashed regarding the Jewish people. The conversations among the children brings out their inquisitive nature that is usually oppressed by their trainors. And, one can't blame the child here for hating the Jewish because from a very early age, this is the only knowledge they haveconfronted.The movie beautifully shows how social factors affects the children in such a way that they don't realise it until they are adults or inquisitive."
JOJO RABBIT,23 December 2020,9/10,"I had very little interest in watching this, because from all the marketing i was led to believe it was a farcical comedy. Comedy is one of my favourite genres, but modern comedy movies are usually incredibly unfunny and puerile. I was expecting Hitler to spend all his time breaking wind and getting into ""hilarious"" scrapes.But the film is nothing like that at all. I wouldn't even call it a comedy, because there is barely anything funny about it. Sure, there are a few mildly amusing moments, but i didn't actually laugh once through the entire movie. It reminded me of another WW2 masterpiece, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Jojo is definitely a lot more light hearted a film, but it's still a dark and serious warning about how easily humans are manipulated.I would say anybody expecting satire, will probably be disappointed. To me, there is no satire of note. Not unless you view portraying (imaginary) Hitler as a maniac and the ideology of demonising and subsequently murdering people for no reason whatsoever as satire. It's not satire unless there is something seriously wrong with you, it's just reality of the insane situation.I'm not sure if the end result is how it was supposed to turn out, but whether intentional or not, it's a genuine masterpiece. It's also very rare for a movie about the holocaust to portray the reality of Jewish people being strong. They had to be, they had no choice.It doesn't take strength to be a sheep and blindly follow the populist view. That is a sign of weakness. It doesn't take strength to destroy out of anger. It doesn't take strength to hide behind weapons and uniforms. The Nazis were the biggest cowards in history and it's something that is usually ignored in film."
JOJO RABBIT,23 August 2021,10/10,"AMAZING! Sure to be a classic, emotional, funny and realistic! Taika Waititi did an incredible job. Brilliant!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 December 2019,10/10,"First of all, I haven't read the book by Christine Laurens this movie is based on, but the teaser and trailer for the movie got me immediately hooked.
By the trailer, you can assume it is comedy, but it is far more than that, believe me. Today I had the opportunity to see the movie, and what a movie this is.It starts as a comedy as seen in trailer, but after a few minutes into it, you realize that it is a serious war drama with comedy in the right places. In my opinion, there wasn't a movie which can balance comedy and tragedy this good, at least not in recent time I remember. For a movie with a dark theme, this one looks so colorful, but it seems that is the point since it is seen from the young boy perspective, and Taika Waititi's movies are full of bright colors.The cast is perfect; Thomasin, Scarlett, Taika, Alfie, Rebel, Archie as Yorki, and my favorite Sam Rockwell as eccentric Captain Klenzendorfbut, hats off to young Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo - he really caries the movie. Usually, I really disliked Rebel Wilson's appearance in movies, not because of her alone and her acting (she's really good actually) but the type of the movies she was in are not my ""cup of tea"". But here, she fits absolutely perfect as crazed nazi woman, and she nailed it. From now on, you have my sympathies, young lady.Taika is genius at his own at filmmaking, his movies are always full of great soundtrack and that style is what gets me more into the movie.
I must thank all of the crew behind this for beautiful movie experience, it is one of the years best, no doubt about it. So, obviously, this is a must watch!And all of you who cheers for war and more hate, take a look at this one here among the others, and ask yourself - is the war what you really want? Because sooner or later, it will come at your front door and that is a bitter truth."
JOJO RABBIT,22 November 2020,10/10,"Been waiting for ages to watch this film. I do not understand how anyone can give this film a low rating unless they a) need to be spoon fed the story, characterisation and when to think for themselves. b) they enjoy the feeling of being controversial c) they lack any empathy to the characters & story d) they are just too thick!!
This film made me fearful, uneasy yet also renewed my faith in human nature. It was the type of film where you were laughing one minute and nearly crying the next. Films like this remind us just how fragile peace is and how easy it is to let mad leaders sweep a country down a path that ruins lives."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is the perfect mix of emotions. The cast is amazing, the screenplay and directing are brilliant!!! Not a single weakness... It deserves all of the awards it gets and more. It goes in my top 10 of all time"
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,9/10,"What a fantastic movie! A wonderful story, very well written. Perfect art directing with excellent acting paired with great humor.Mr Waititi proved again to be one the greatest writer and director talent of his generation. Perfect casting and I applause to the young actors who brought the story to life. This movie is so much more than just a satire."
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,10/10,"Going into the film you hear the word of mouth about how dynamic this film is. Being a huge fan of Taika Waititi since Green Lantern, people forget that; I was excited to see this. I knew every since the trailer dropped months ago it was a film I would see.Let me tell you; this film is marvelous! I love this movie! I was laughing, and crying at the same time. How is that possible? I have no idea.
Such a moving film and one that'll be talked about for decades to come. If you haven't seen it, please do."
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,3/10,"With all the (hilarious) effort to make any humfn being responsible for what war does to a child - it comes with a zero effect after a 10 year old boy strangely forgets his mother very fast, unbelivably fast.
3 out of 10."
JOJO RABBIT,26 August 2021,10/10,"Properly outrages. Neonazis will absolutely hate this film. Then again, fascists are used to unknowingly denying reality. Funny, insightful, painful, and hilariously realistic, Jojo is yet another Taika masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,14 November 2021,2/10,"I tried to like this movie. I saw it in theaters and then just watched it a second time today. There are good parts to this movie, but overall it does not hold together as a whole.Sam Rockwell was great, Scarlett Johansen's fake accent was totally unacceptable. The music is great, but the story jumps around and has weird pacing. One of the other issues that I take exception to, is that 1930s Germany isn't a source of comedy for someone like me. I am not sure that the world in 2020 really needed a quirky nazi-themed comedy. This is the type of idea that needs to be stopped before the cameras start rolling. Although parts of this story are emotional and heart-breaking, the outrageous portrayal of the Gestapo as a funny Abbott and Costello type character is hard to watch. Some people might argue that this film does justice to history by showing the real consequences, the grim realities, but I will argue the opposite, I think this film spends too much time caught up in the comedy aspect and not enough honouring the millions of people who died in the holocaust. Other people will be able to see past the holocaust and enjoy this movie, but I just can't. Sorry Taika."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,6/10,"For me the movie felt somewhat uneven, as if it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Some parts are very over the top, then it becomes very serious but the drama didn't do it for me. Plus it was even kind of dull at times. I was never convinced that Jojo was a real fanatic no matter how many people insist that he is."
JOJO RABBIT,26 August 2020,10/10,"Such a relief to see a movie that is not a reboot, remake, sequel, prequel, parody, or rip-off.It took me a while to gather up my courage to watch as every Nazi/WWII/Holocaust movie I've ever seen is tense and often agonizing. I can't believe I actually laughed at scenes with Taika playing Hitler. I think if you can make play Hitler AND make people laugh, there is something cringe-fully awesome about it. Casting was beautiful, exceptional performances everyone. The two little boys caught my heart. Sam Rockwell's character had an oddly moving subtext he played out wonderfully. Both funny and sorrowful, this film is a masterpiece. It made my heart ache and joyful at the same time, I reveled in the quality of the storytelling with sheer relief."
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,1/10,Maybe I'm just having an off day or something because I just can't get into this film. Watched about an hour and none of the jokes are hitting and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. Maybe this film would have benefited from being a 15-18 and having it be more outrageous and shocking. Just anything to stop it being so vanilla really.
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,8/10,"He's done it again! Just a great film with sensational acting. It's hard to say who carries the film best with amazing performances from Rockwell, Johansson, McKenzie and Wilson but Roman Davis is sensational and takes you on his journey from start to finish. Exceptional film that's bound to be a classic."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,4/10,"The photography are on point, costumes are great, but i found the characters very forced and not funny at all"
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,7/10,The movie was hilarious and tragic. An original and emotional movie . good but short movie.. the movie goes so fast .
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,6/10,"It's a nice, cute movie. You wouldn't have wasted time watching it. But if you are someone who watches one move a week. There are better ones."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,5/10,"Trailer is misleading, a lot of time wasted, wanted to stop watching at least 4 times. all of the movie is bad except of the last 25 minutes which actually grabbed my attention for a bit. total disappointment. and what made me even more mad is that they casted Scarlett Johansson and she only acted for like 15 mins or so."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,8/10,"The hilarious and brilliant intro put a smile on my face from get go. It is a very funny movie but at the same time it doesn´t shy away from the serious parts one bit.
Great actors all the way with Scarlett Johansen and ""Jojo Rabbit"" shining the brightest.
A must see in my opinion."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,,"Never have I ever seen something like this. When I began this movie, I figured from the opening 10 minutes or so that this one is going to be a funny, ridiculing take on the well documented WW2 Nazi Germany. Sure, the ironic and farcical elements were to the point and actually quite hilarious at times, but I thought that would be that. I'll have a good laugh, then question myself for laughing, and then I'll forget this movie and move on. When I was done with this one, I could hardly think about anything else, and I still can't. This movie is a genius piece of art that needs more appreciation and acknowledgement.
I thought the concept of looking at the WW2 Nazi Germany from a child's point of view, and especially, from a pro-Nazi kid who wants to join the army and fight alongside Hitler was a brilliant idea. This allows the movie to depict the massive propaganda and brainwashing that was done to the youth of Germany to train their minds into an absolute loathing and hatred of Jews. This is exactly why Adolf Hitler is here a funny and ridiculous character who is an imaginary friend of Jojo. This is what the kids felt in those times, they thought of Hitler as someone they liked and wanted to be friends with because of the way they were taught about him. However, the artistic brilliance is, despite a funny portrayal of him, Hitler in the movie is hardly qualified to become a role-model. He dressing sense is not heroic, rather really stupid and buffoonish, his temperament is childlike and devoid of sense, and he is also portrayed as scared of many things. The cheerful fashion in which the kids are trained to throw grenades and burn books and are told all sorts of devilish fantastical things about Jews which to them are creatures quite different, is funny and also extremely satirical. The humour in this movie is never too-forced, albeit it stretches to the ridiculous but that's not of bad taste, at least for me. Special mention to the ""German-Shepherd"" moment and also, Rockwell's comical personality as a whole.
The fascinating concept of the movie is backed up and at times lifted up further by amazing individual performances by each and every member of the cast, even Rebel Wilson, who is her usual eccentric self. Now, all this aside, the real show-stealer in the movie is the truly heartfelt emotional moments which takes this movie to a different level altogether. The incredibly powerful ""shoe-scene"", the relationship between Elsa and Jojo, the ""they love ugly people"" followed by Jojo's reflection of his own face in the mirror, and special mention to Sam Rockwell's final scene. This scene truly describes Waititi's idea of this movie. Rockwell's character, despite being a Nazi Officer and portraying the bad guy, actually helps Jojo and Elsa out of a tight situation and ultimately, saves Jojo's life. Therefore, although he perhaps has taken many innocent lives based on his character, he does save one life at the end. This could be seen in the light that even the most-cruel people are capable of change. I thought this sends a wonderful message to the audience. The contrasting scenes of Wilson sending a young boy to ""hug"" a Russian enemy with a bomb on his back and this final scene of Rockwell saving Jojo's life and dying right after made me really thinking.
Finally, the all-important purpose of the movie, which has divided opinions among critics. Some say this movie is too casual and lighthearted in its approach towards very dark times, some believe it miscommunicates the identity and personality of Hitler. However, watching the movie closely makes it clear that Waititi, despite all the humour and ridicule, sends a strong message: Love triumphs Hate no matter what. This is quite well documented through the course of the film and the ridiculous and farcical elements in the movie only makes this message more vividly visible. Now, the question remains, are you ready for it?"
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is funny as all heck. The little boy in the movie, In spite of being a racist who hates Jewish people he was totally adorable. Adolf is a lovable buffoon. I agree the movie is in bad taste. But it is funny and made fun of a very bad thing such as the Jewish extermination. It shows the ignorance of the nazi's of what they taught the Hitler youth.
It's worth watching."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,9/10,"With all the talk of lack of diversity in awards ceremonies... another group could be overlooked. Young Actors. Roman Griffin Davis is handed a huge role here with heaps of screen time and dialogue. What a great performance. He nails it.A young boy endures the end of the War in Europe whilst the war puts an end to his childhood. Befriending a Jewish Girl who has been hidden by his mother. His choices, friendships and key moments are guided by the imagined friendly guidance of Hitler (aptly the Director - Taika Waititi - casting himself in this mode of Direction).Great supporting acting from Stephen Merchant, Rebel Wilson and Sam Rockwell... but Roman Griffin Davis steals the show in this heartwarming, tear-jerking, beautifully written black comedy. Recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,7/10,"I want to start by saying I recommend this movie. It is at times funny, but mostly just amusing, it also has some very serious moments as well, which were good. The cast is also great, especially the boy who is the main character."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,8/10,"A soft hearted movie which will make you laugh and cry. Great cast, magnificent way of telling the times of WW2 from the point of view of a 10 year old.
Taika Waititi, thanks for existing man."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,8/10,Love Jojo. Typical kid. Extremely emotional moment when Scarlett Johansson dies. And more emotional climax when Freedom overwhelmed loneliness.
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is lovely!!! It's has a really good balance between the comedy and the drama. The comedy is ridiculously amazing!! I loved it.
I would say more but you should go and see for yourselves. Simply, An amazing movie."
JOJO RABBIT,21 October 2020,8/10,"JoJo Rabbit is an excellent film. Despite all the darkness surrounding the time period this is set in, Waititi manages to pull through and find the lightly comedic parts that need it while still recognising more negative aspects of the war and not drowning us in gags. Adolf as JoJo's imaginary friend was an excellent dynamic and it was empowering when we saw JoJo finally beat the life of fighting and hating he was born into. The casting was excellent, directing was thriving and throughout our all, I could sense Waititi's deadpan, sometimes offbeat humour. My only complaints are that the pacing felt a little too fast for the part where JoJo finally removes the 'Hitler' part of his mind and that Jemaine Clement or Bret McKenzie didn't have cameos but that's more of a fanboy complaint and didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie"
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,9/10,He has done it again. If you are looking for something that will force you through half dozen different emotions in the space of five minutes look no further. Triff movie.
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,7/10,A great attempt at a light-hearted feel good satirical comedy. This movie will help to pass the time but isn't anything special.
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,8/10,"I'm a fan of Taika's Waititi's other films like Boy, Hunt for the Wilder People etc and JoJo Rabbit didn't disappoint! Funny and poignant at the same time. Obviously the holocaust is a hugely serious topic and if you're someone who will get easily offended by this topic being used in a comedy then don't watch it. For anyone else, it's worth the watch! I suppose its a type of comedy that will appeal to some and won't appeal to others.."
JOJO RABBIT,10 August 2021,10/10,"It makes you laugh and makes you weep.Excellent casting, beautifully shot.....watch this movie, it ROCKS."
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2020,8/10,"An admittedly fun and whimsical take on perhaps the darkest moment in modern history that doesn't fail to remind you what the consequences of defying Germany is. Note: The shoes in, perhaps, the most heart breaking scene In cinema that I have seen in a long time."
JOJO RABBIT,11 August 2020,4/10,"Let me preface by saying that Taika Waititi is a genius and I am not. I am very knowledgeable of WW2 and I think that inhibited my ability to find the humor in this movie that many others have raved about. The immense real tragedy of the subject matter made finding slapstick humor essentially impossible for me. One gag depiction after another of Nazi's in full buffoonery just couldn't get it with me even though the message and tragic nature of this era is fully exposed, at least at times. I can honestly say that I didn't laugh once. I barely raised a smile. I wish I could have enjoyed the humor others have expressed, but for me it was the equivalent of making a funny movie about Jeffrey Dahmer. Sorry."
JOJO RABBIT,4 August 2020,10/10,"I love movies seen through child's eyes! ThIs is a happier version of ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" sort of......"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,10/10,"This has met all my million expectations by just watching the trailers and reading about it. I knew it would be exactly as I have wished. It was more. I cried my eyes out from laughing out loud. 😂🤣🤣🤣 In stiches! It's that funny! Hilarious!!!! Every shot meticulously edited and thought of. The kids are unbearably adorable and talented as can be. I started LOLing from the first minute throughout. I've had so much fun!!! Sam Rockwell and Scarlet, Taika Waititi (🤣🤣), Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant,... Have I missed anyone. Forgive me. It was love at first sight, tailored for me. I'm not alone, I'm sure. Outstanding work. Will watch countless times."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,9/10,"In a solid year for films, particularly those at the business end of the awards season Jojo Rabbit stands out a mile. Mining the most horrific period in modern history for laughs is not to be attempted lightly. This film however manages to combine genuine belly laughs and consistent chuckles with real heart. For this alone it deserves all the praise it has received.It splices the emotion of Spielberg (without the schmaltz), the slapstick of Python (without the real silliness) and the off beat characterisation of the Coen Brothers and filters it all through Waititi's unique comedic voice.Anyone who has followed Waititi's career as I have from Flight of the Conchords through to Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor Ragnarok will see elements of all of these laced subtlety and more overtly through Jojo. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is probably the closest thing to a companion piece in that they are both driven by a child navigating a grown ups world and both deliver laughs and tears.If you've seen the trailer or know a little of the film then the story is basically one of Jojo, a passionate Hitler Youth member who in the absence of siblings and a father imagines himself none other than Der Fuhrer as a friend.He is of course played by the director Taiki Waititi in what can only be described a a unique take on history's worst human. The interplay between him and Jojo (played brilliantly by Roman Griffin Davis in incredibly his first film role) propels the first act as Jojo seeks to become the very model of the HitlerJugend. Bright eyed, inmocent, cherubic and full of zest he fantasies in his bedroom of glory while dressed in his uniform as any young boy the world over would do dressed as their favourite sports star or singer.We soon meet Sam Rockwell as the youth camp captain. As always he delivers, bringing a little of his character in Billboards to what is essentially the shell of a once proud Nazi no longer able to take part in combat due to an injury. He is a shambling, drunken but still wily man who manages to dole out advice to our young protagonist even though you are aware he is maybe not entirely on board with the party line.Scarlett Joahnsson plays Jojo's Mother and is utterly charming as a single parent trying to keep her child a child while keeping him safe. She is playful, tough and teaches Jojo that there's more to life than Hitler and the war. She also has her secrets which give the film it's weight and most heartbreaking scene.The real centerpiece of the film though is the relationship between Jojo and Elsa (another brilliant performance from a young actress I first seen in Leave no Trace and again excels here). Her discovery by Jojo begins to really anchor the direction of the film and is deftly played by the director as initial fear and horror are soon turned into curiosity and friendship. Much to the chagrin of Jojo's imaginary friend. (Worth noting at this point that Jojo's only real friend up to this point is Yoki who is a relentlessly optimistic delight and delivers much of the film's comic relief, even when things get really heavy).As Jojo and Elsa's relationship blooms the spectre of the war machine's most insidious parts are never too far away and it is not long before an impromptu home inspection from the local Gestapo takes place.Despite being played largely for laughs at the start it becomes genuinely tense as Thomasin McKenzie playing Elsa conveys all the inner turmoil and resilience as expertly as an actress far beyond her years. The scene drips in Pathos but as is the genius of Waititi, things are never allowed to get too heavy and we are soon chuckling again thanks to Stephen Merchant and his band of hapless goons.The film begins to draw to a close as Jojo is left bereft and begins to lose what's left of his faith in the war. He resolves to protect his Jewish stowaway at all costs. As the Red army encircle the city and break through the last of the defences the final scene plays out like an old fashioned farce with young and old alike strapped with guns and bombs they can barely carry never mind operate. In actuality anyone with a cursory knowledge of Berlin's last stand will know this isn't as ridiculous as it seems.Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf finally realises his heroic potential as the survivors (Jojo included) are rounded up by the Red Army. He knowingly creates a skirmish with Jojo which he knows will set Jojo free but result in his death. It's played brilliantly and Jojo is free to return home to his beloved Elsa.Torn between telling her the truth and risk her exercising her new freedom and telling her a lie to keep her close, his inner conflict is there for all to see. He ultimately does the right thing and they step outside together for the first time in a new Germany and much changed world. This however is not before a final reckoning between Jojo and the ghost of his imaginary friend. Hardened by what he has been through and completely enchanted by Elsa, he delivers the film's final hilarious, punch the air moment.If this does not win best picture it will not be a major surprise given the Academy's form for playing it safe with the Oscar's. But make no mistake, in years to come this will be the one people will say should have won.A triumph, Heil Waititi!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,1 December 2021,9/10,"I really liked this movie. It covers social indoctrination, friendship, and ultimately redemption. This is not really a comedy, it's a statement on the human condition told in a humorous way. All this told through the eyes of a young boy with Hitler as an imaginary friend."
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,10/10,"It's hard to describe just how beautiful this movie really is. We have been beaten to death in the past 75 years with WW2 movies. WW2, and especially its cause, has been used as a metaphor for current political developments so often that people have begun to be desensitized by it. Comparing contemporary populist politicians with Fascism and Nazism has become so inordinate that it's now a running joke amongst populist and alt-right voters to a point it has become almost meaningless.But once in a while, this message is dissected meticulously to its core by some of the most creative minds of their generation and then presented to us in a truly unique way, gracefully moving and dancing around the perpetual pitfalls of most other war movies. After 'la Vita é Bella' and 'Er ist wieder da' now comes JoJo Rabbit.In its essence, the cause for war and ultimately the Holocaust was steady, organized polarization, desensitization and mass propaganda through education. In Germany, this started at a very young age in school and then through paramilitary indoctrination, from age 10, in the Jungvolk (10-14) and Hitlerjugend (14-18). JoJo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year old boy, Johannes, who is already a fanatical admirer of Hitler before he starts his uniformed life as a Jungvolk member. Through his eyes, we see how he experiences the last year of the war (mid-44 to mid-45) in a way only kids can: blissfully naive, energetic and full of dreams. His imaginary best friend is Hitler himself. The world around him is harsh and unforgiving, but in his mind, it's all playful and understandable. It reminds me so much of how I experienced my life at a young age.Many critics panned this movie for being silly, leaving out the holocaust and most true horrors of war. But they completely miss the point; this is war as experienced by a 10-year old. This is no funny satire, this is not a comedy. This is a story about love, prejudice and ultimately freedom, with some very Monty Python-esque storytelling and humor to set its tone.Go see it."
JOJO RABBIT,17 May 2020,10/10,The first half you will laugh the second half you will cry... brilliant film
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,9/10,"Pure genius!
Thank you Taika!
Just keep on doing this!"
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,10/10,"It takes a special filmmaker to take a character as Hitler and lampoon him, and Taiki does just that - brilliantly. A film that runs that gamut of emotions. All the actors were great, Sam Rockwell steals every scene he's in. Absolutely one of the best films of the year."
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,8/10,"Clearly Taika Waititis unorthodox directing style, which I liked :) Jokes were good, cinematography and acting great! Film shows you how the war and its consequences affects children in not so good way.
Story was also good but used, in sense that there were couple of similar ""saving innocent and becoming his/her friend"" kind of films.
Overall enjoyed the film!ps."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,9/10,"Watch it and judge for yourself. We did, and we laughed, and we cried. And, yes, children did fight and die."
JOJO RABBIT,19 August 2021,10/10,"The movie is funny, touching, great cast and direct. Scarlett's best acting to date. Worth watching twice and more."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,9/10,"A real look back into the past of nazi Germany, mixed with comedy for the not so serious feel.
It won an Oscar, which for this type of film is unusual so it just shows how good it was."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"To my mind, one of the best movies of the year. It's such a great comedy, with moments so hilarious that will make you cry. But apart from that, it's such a sweet story that will melt your heart. If you are hesitating at the cinema, this is the perfect option for you."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,9/10,"-to author Christine Leunens, on whose novel the screenplay is based
-to Taika Waititi, who wrote the screenplay, as well as produced, directed, and starred in this film
-to Roman Griffin Davis as Johannes ""Jojo Rabbit"" Betzler, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa Korr, Scarlett Johansson as Frau Rosie Betzler, and, of course, Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf.I took a chance on this movie: it sounded too weird, and had some bad reviews; but it was not weird: it was creative, thoughtful, and very moving!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 October 2020,9/10,"Superb acting, Brilliant story line and an exceptional original plot making.A. Must watch before you die
B. You can enjoy it
C. Don't waste your money and time.This is 'A' type of movie."
JOJO RABBIT,26 November 2019,4/10,"What happened in WWII was very serious so don't misunderstand me.I went into this movie totally blind, we saw the ""poster"" on the computer screen selling tickets and it didn't indicate it was any sort of Nazi or war movie so we thought it would be fun to have a complete surprise unfold before our eyes. I knew something was going on when they rolled 2 war movie advertisements as part of a really long opening to the movie. I mean really, there are people who fill their calendars with the opening dates of war movies?Anyway, this is a twist on the stereotypical European setting Nazi war movie where they focus of a few individuals instead of the mass horror that took place. Whoever keeps paying to have these annual Nazi movies produced needs to stop, the last one I went to was Inglorious Basterds and that was it for me. There is nothing new to be discovered with these movies. Please find a new war or at least a new setting outside of Europe. Please spend money creating awareness where there is no awareness. You have a great power to do so.The acting was OK and you can fall into the story but I wished I was watching something else the entire time."
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,8/10,"It is hard to say that this movie is comedy or its making fun from war.it is just look at this condition from a 10 years old Kid.
it is definitly Hard for writing a screenplay from eyes of a kid.It is a novel view and Deserve to get screenplay in oscar."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a very entertaining film that lets the almost 2-hour runtime fly by. I have never seen a film that takes place during the Second World War, which takes its basic principles minimally seriously, but still makes the leap into the serious, even sad. Not to mention the brilliant performance of the young actors (not to mention Scarlett Johannson), this film offers a closed, good-looking overall project, which, however, is not made for everyone due to the black humor."
JOJO RABBIT,17 June 2020,8/10,"Sensitive area in which to make jokes about, but the film does it well.
A couple of flaws in the film regarding the death of his mother, doesn't add up, but overall we can overlook it.
Two actors to mention Sam Rockwell as the drunk officer and to a lesser part Archie Yates as Jojo's friend were both excellent and comic!
The film covers all bases and one everyone can enjoy"
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was worth making an account for. The movie starts off a bit slapstick with the main character's imaginary friend being a joking Adolf Hitler. After that, it soon evolves into a beautiful exploration of the main character's motives. JoJo, a 10 year old Hitlerjugend boy, faces a lot of internal and external struggles throughout the movie while he's hiding a Jewish girl in his attic. Meanwhile, Germany is very busy losing WWII. There went a lot of bravery into showcasing this tragic part of the World War, mixing some humour in it, while still making it feel so real. Movie of the year for me for sure!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 May 2020,9/10,"This film was exceptional on many fronts. It was a comedy but contained some real human elements, Mainly the relationship between the boy jojo and his hideaway friend.
The costumes were brilliant and the idea behind the film for me was the boy shaking off Naziism and seeing the true horror that the German Reich had brought to his homeland.
This film deserves your time and is a cinematic masterpiece"
JOJO RABBIT,10 April 2020,10/10,You can not watch a trailer for this movie and give it a fair chance. I hate I missed this one in 2019. Such a powerful satire movie that the world could use right now.
JOJO RABBIT,19 September 2020,10/10,"This is a perfect parody. It is such an ironic film looking at todays ""leaders"". You need to watch it. Think. Then watch again. So many layers of brilliance."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi doesn't not disappoint as director. Characters are amazing, not only do they grow and change but they feel emotion better than most movies i have seen."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2021,5/10,"I see the vision and goal of what they were trying to do here and am glad many others appreciated it, but it just didn't do it for me. I really wanted to love it as the concept was brilliant and the trailer looked hilarious but only ended up laughing at two brief moments in the entire film. The 60's-era music also yanked my mind too hard right out of the period and gravity of the situation."
JOJO RABBIT,27 June 2020,8/10,"Funny and tragic.
I'm impressed with how the movie manages to be both funny and tragic without losing focus or going too far in either direction.
Waititi has become my favorite director and I can't wait for his next movie.I'm also so incredibly impressed with the performance of Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie.
I don't want to be mean but it was a little embarrassing that big hollywood name Johansson got so outperformed by these 2 rising stars."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2021,9/10,"I just rewatched this, having seen it on an airplane originally. It is outrageously awesome - I can remember people on the plane turning to try and work out why I was laughing out loud, but I can also remember sobbing quietly at other moments. Second watch is just as brilliant, with as many guffaws/sobs as the first watch.The two boys playing Jojo and Yorki are amazing and adorable (and I generally don't like kids!). They bring such a warmth to their roles, and such comedic touches. Both have great acting futures.Waititi deserves huge praise as director and actor in this movie. His portrayal of Hitler is hilarious. I also really liked Sam Rockwell's character, moving from buffoonery to empathy over the course of the tale. Only Rebel Wilson's characterisation jarred a little (for me). Everyone else - awesome.Highly recommended movie - watch it, laugh, cry, admire."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,9/10,"Guys, if you haven't enjoyed the movie, you're really something!
Don't be jealous about it's positive reviews just because you can't think positive, have a good day! :)"
JOJO RABBIT,13 April 2021,3/10,"If they made this movie with the same actors and the same principal story, but without any of the ridiculous out of place comedy, it could have been another 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas'.This movie was completely ruined by its tone, the satire genre is hit and miss at the best of times, and this was definately a big miss, it just didnt work, i didnt crack even the slightest of smiles throughout the entire film,I feel that this was a massivly wasted opportunity, Done in the right way Jojo Rabbit had the potential to be one of the best WW2 movies of its kind, right up the with Schindlers List, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and The Pianist, instead we got this muddled mess that felt like a parody/spoof.film, and not a very good one at that."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,5/10,"Had a few satirical moments worth a chuckle, but this is not a comedy. Not an action movie. Not a true drama. Not sure how to describe it except to say that this was simply not a good movie. Go see something else."
JOJO RABBIT,21 January 2020,6/10,"The good: nice camerawork, pretty costume design, overall nice cinematography and lighthearted comedic momentsThe bad: extremely naive take on the atrocities of war, boring and predictable plot and overall the execution is very ""safe"" while masquerading as something daring and original.The concept has the potential to be a groundbreaking film, but it falls way short of it."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a satire that showcases the brilliance of Taika Watiti's writing and directing skills. The powerful emotions the film envokes sneak up on you in a way that you wouldn't expect for a satirical piece. And there are some truly brilliant performances by all of the case, particular Scarlet Johansson and Sam Rockwell. In fact, I hope Johansson gets nominated this award season for her brilliant performance."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,8/10,"Initially I wasn't that keen about watching this but after reading some reviews and seeing all the award noms it got, I thought why? To my surprise it was brilliant, funny and heartbreaking at the time. Reminds me a lot of 'Life is Beautiful', another film about WW2 with similar tones."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,8/10,"If you can plow through the first very silly and disjointed 20 minutes, you will be rewarded with a real heartfelt story. Very touching and well done."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,10/10,"I Was totally surprised by this movie !
Funny
Smart
Brilliantly acted"
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is absolutely delightful. So funny from the get go. Even though the topic is not a funny topic, it's good to find humor where we can and I think this movie does a good job of using humor to highlight the problems.
The innocence of the kid shows us where we can blindly follow and be brainwashed no matter how absurd the belief. But when faced with actual reality that clashes with your belief are we willing to let go?
This movie is not perfect. For one the comedy does over shadow the tragedy. The tragedy gets glossed over. But I think we all know the tragedy and horror that happened. This movie isn't focused on that rather the absurdity of the belief system that brought it about."
JOJO RABBIT,22 September 2020,10/10,"This one was a sleeper for me. I had no idea what I was getting into. Incredibly well written, the acting is on point and makes it easy to fall in love with the characters. Haven't had a movie make me laugh like this in a while. Not going to lie, I've been losing faith in Hollywood lately but this movie has given me hope."
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,1/10,"As a film it is good, but i felt the whole concept was a slap on reality. Maybe I didn't find it funny because the whole time I could only think of actual survivor(holocaust) interviews. So for me nothing about world war is a joke and this movie shows a bit disrespect towards it. And to be frank the comdey was subpar.
I mean even though I hate what they did regarding war and all, it did not fulfill its purpose"
JOJO RABBIT,7 October 2020,10/10,"Give Scarlett Johanssonn an Oscar already!! This film moved me to tears. It mixes very dramatic and serious themes with sparks of wit. The young boys' acting is very very very good. There's such tenderness underlying the whole dark theme, a tenderness within people which didn't even need to be spoken. That tenderness won my heart. Bravo to the cast and the director."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,8/10,Jo Jo Rabbit is extremely funny and very emotionally heartfelt. The directing is amazing by Taika Waititi who also plays a hilarious yet very overtop Hitler. The story is also really sweet has a really good message on top of all the dark humor. All of the acting is great especially with all of the kids and of course Scarlet Johansen as the mother. Like I already stated the humor is really good dose a good job lightening up the mood especially towards the end of the movie when it gets really intense. Even the set design is good doing a great job making it look and feel like Nazi Germany during world war two. As for the one flaw I do have with the movie it is that the film could have used maybe one more emotional punch and maybe a little more closure to the story towards the end though the film still is very emotional at times. Overall JO JO Rabbit is a great film with great humor and with a story that will emotionally pull on your heartstrings especially for JO Jo's relationship with his mother and the Jewish girl they are hiding.
JOJO RABBIT,13 July 2020,1/10,"I sat through the first half hour of this and didn't laugh once, there were no jokes or any remotely funny parts. Just some awkward jew jokes that weren't funny, but maybe when faulty towers or allo allo covered these back in the 70s and 80s. It was like watching a school play you HAD to sit through because your kid was in it, dialogue was AS bad.
Funniest part of this was when, as a laugh, they awarded it an Oscar.
I know he's young but the main actor's accent was awful. Flitting between vaguely Austrian and posh English. He's supposed to be a professional actor.
The director playing Hitler was just over-indulgent. He can't really act, or isn't particularly funny. I think Prince Harry carried off the role better!"
JOJO RABBIT,30 March 2020,9/10,A well written reply to racism and war. Movie with beautiful cinematography and brilliant acting with a tinge of humour in each character.
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2021,6/10,This movie is fine as from a pespective of a child .. but as for me . this wasnt the thing i was hoping from this movie..
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,8/10,"Biopics and historical films make charming materials to watch. They provide learning and insights into what ought to be or not. 'Jojo Rabbit' is a seemingly light hearted treatise into a bygone era of hate, suspicion and state-run terror in Hitler's Germany towards the end of World War II.The film unfold through the travails of a fancifully jingoistic Jojo (Roman Davis) who is charmed by Hitler's Third Reich, albeit in an innocent way. Jojo is indoctrinated by Adolf (played by Taika Waititi) a comical, imaginary version of Adolf Hitler, who serves as Jojo's soul-keeper. He is an active participant in the Hitler youth camp along with his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates). The camp is run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) assisted by Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) - hilariously enacted by both. Jojo's mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) an anti-Nazi rebel, secretly harbours a Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in her attic, hitherto unknown to Jojo. Soon Jojo finds out about Elsa - which confuses his mind about loyalty and rightness.The plot develops around Jojo and Elsa - and how Jojo's false notions about Jews transforms into reality, resulting in his liking for Elsa. In the meantime Jojo's mother is hanged by Nazis, leaving him in the sole company of Elsa. And outside, the regime is falling, while the Allies troops romp in - and the film ending on with feel-good factor.The plain narrative, embellished with layers of fantasy laced in between, makes the film a pleasant viewing. The witty and at times hilarious dialogues, makes the satire feel full of life. The film is also a gentle reminder to the worse times, not long ago - and why we must cherish the values gained.I will vote this for an Oscar."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,10/10,"Taika Waititi deserves nomination for best director and best supporting actor, all actors, but I repeat ALL actors give excellent performance, the kid did the best performance I've ever seen from a boy his age, the girl has a great future in Hollywood and Scarlett Johanson is showing us more and more that she is more than a Blockbuster actress and in my opinion deserves to win this year Oscar for best lead actress. Being honest, it was one of the few films that made me feel so empathetic with the supporting characters, it's tragic but hilarious at the same time. Without doubt one of the best this year. 10/10"
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,4/10,Very very very very bad not just bad its really bad
JOJO RABBIT,11 March 2021,10/10,Taika is brilliant. And i cant believe this is Roman Griffin Davis's first movie! He is beyond talented and im already exicet for his next movies.Rosie's death reveal scene was PERFECT. And i really think there is no flaws in this movie!!!<3
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,9/10,"I went in not knowing anything of the film but the fact that it's a kid with an affliction for nazism who's imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler, and I'm really happy I did because I couldn't have been more (pleasantly) surprised. This film delivers so many fantastic little moments of hilarity as well as sadness. The fact that this film gets to be made is something I think we underestimate and is free speech in effect.Child actors can very often produce a hit or miss performance, but Roman Griffin Davis makes you really, really care for little Jojo with a sound performance - if he gets to work some more on his accent he'll be flawless as far as innocence goes. Scarlett Johansson gives it her absolute all, what an amazing performance by her.Taika Waititi. Just bravo. What a mind this guy has. First he co-creates one of the most underrated comedies of our time; What we do in the shadows, and now he creates this fantastic piece of cinema as well as act amazingly in it as well.The fact a film I can summarize as ""a kid on the track of being a Hitler jugend, struggles with his convictions after a series of absurd situations with his imaginary friend: Adolf Hitler"" can both make you laugh as well as get choked up to the point of tears is just a testament to the brilliant writing as well as the acting. And although the film has some crazy situations it never really pushes the satire on you with a bulldozer, it's really sparingly and intelligently dropped in where it still draws out an ""Ha!"" when you least expect it."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,"This is a great movie. One of the best. Tied for second for me. I think that all the haters didn't go into it with an open mind. It's blatantly obvious that it's a satire. If you can get over the fact that Jojo's imaginary friend is Hitler, then there's a good chance you'll love it."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best and funniest films I've seen in a while, this movie had everything and more. If you haven't seen this movie yet then you are seriously missing out!"
JOJO RABBIT,11 March 2020,8/10,"One of my favourite films from 2019, a rollercoaster of emotions. made with such passion and thought"
JOJO RABBIT,7 April 2020,8/10,"With a playful and relaxed attitude, with the vision of the Scouts before the end of the war to depict the embarrassment before the defeat of Germany and the glory of human nature, behind the comedy in the lens is actually a tragedy iPhone"
JOJO RABBIT,15 August 2020,10/10,Best movie ever!So so so funny. Taika Waititis Work is always so funny.
JOJO RABBIT,1 May 2020,9/10,"Trying to show it in a serious manner, what this film has shown in a satirical way, would have become too depressing and hard hitting. Waititi's satire manages to create a total mockery of the Nazi regime. A ten-year-old, shown to be a Nazi fanatic is actually interesting. It helps us to understand that prejudice is built at a young age. Through various little nuances, Waititi beautifully shows how fanaticism is born and thrives on propaganda, disinformation and character assassination.
There is one really awesome symbolism in the film. In the beginning Jojo doesn't even know how to tie his shoe lace, and in the end he ties Elsa's shoe lace. Which tries shows how fanatics don't have even basic knowledge and yet they seem as if to have an understanding of the world. When Jojo learns to tie the shoe lace in the end, it shows how he has learned much about the world and he gives up on Nazism."
JOJO RABBIT,15 August 2020,10/10,"I have no words to describe this MASTERPIECE, just wanna say that this is the must must must watch."
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I have seen this year. It is hilariously funny and heart wrenching in places and tells a story from a point of a 10 year old boy.Do not give it a miss.
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2021,8/10,Such a great satirical piece. Writing was excellent. So many laughs!
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2021,10/10,"This movie was satisfying and easy to watch. Punctuated with great comedic relief in between serious moments, this movie is well-paced and light hearted despite the subject matter.The visuals of camouflage beiges, browns, and greens are gorgeous and I can't get Rosie's beautiful red shoes out of my head.The Soundtrack was spectacular with songs alternating from music in that time period (perfect and I hate when soundtracks try to modernize their music unsuccessfully) with Beatles songs in German and English.Definitely a favorite for me"
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"What a great movie in all aspects. Great cast, great humour, excellent filming. I'd be surprised if this is not a winner at all the film awards this year."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,5/10,"What's wrong with 2019 Oscar's nominees?? So far only two movies really got my attention: Joker and Little Women.
As for Jojo Rabbit... What can I say? The movie has no soul. It's a mixed bag of comedy, drama and 1% of Historic background. The only thing I really enjoyed was Jojo's imaginary friend. And even that wasn't enough to save the movie. Scarlet Johansson was good but not great. Her time on the screen is so short I can't even make my mind on her performance (and I really like her).
Maybe I was not in a good day, maybe I didn't get the whole satire / comic relief. What I know for sure is that I have no ideia what the director wanted to show the public with this movie. As judging for the other reviews, I am not the only one"
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,This film is heart warming and sweet. There are moments the remind you of the horrors of WWII just like most movies of this time period and also moments that make your heart sing with love. This film is such a joyful experience with a good ending. Worth the ticket price and should be experienced with others in the the theatre.
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,2/10,"Started out with some extremely funny moment. But everyone's accent kept switching from
English to German to Australia to kiwi. It wasn't well done. Then took a turn after the boy discovers the girl and just lacked any substance to the script.
Really confused how this is getting as many awards as it is. Not a horrible film but far from a masterpiece like everyone is describing"
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,1/10,"A comedy or drama or an attempt at both? A cheap rip-off of the great Italian movie, 'Life is Beautiful'."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,10/10,"When I first heard the premise of a little boy with Hitler as his imaginary friend, it sounded like a ludicrous premise. Sounded like the dumbest idea for a movie I'd ever heard of (except for the one where a little kid fish gets lost and he dad fish had to go find him, that did sound pretty boring too, till I saw it).
The ad convinced me it was going to be a great move, a sad movie, a weird movie, with a little bit of romance in it. I was surprised at how often the movie plot surprised me. Many places the story doesn't go where you were expecting.
Beautiful, amazing photography.
Ridiculously funny writing and actors doing an amazing job.It is for Nazi War movies what Amelie is for gritty french romance.
A lot of fun."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,9/10,This movie is phenomenal in every single way possible. It's hilarious but at the same time heartbreaking. The story and acting and lines that are delivered are all incredible. Everyone should watch this movie. Taika Waititi at his best
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2021,9/10,"Finally an original dark Comedy that shows how susceptible people can be to extreme ideas such as the Nazis. I laughed and cried. It is very daring to laugh at such a subject, but he has made something beautiful out of it. Bravo."
JOJO RABBIT,31 March 2020,9/10,"Before watching this, i heard all the great praise it had, being nominated for the oscars and reviews from critiques. I was scared this going to overhype the movie.
However the movie did not disappoint, and i fell in love movie. Taika Waititi is starting to be one of my favourite directors, the way he portrays child characters in such a loving way and true to themselves is astonishing. Whilst the storytelling itself is magnificently told and emotional (much more than expected). Taika depicts one of the most depressing time in history in a way never seen before with great success.
A must see movie!"
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,9/10,"Waititi gives the audience a strong reflection on fascism and war through the innocence of a 10-year-old fanatic German boy living in the final year of World War II. The humor is a mask, under which a strong message accompanied with short but forceful dialogues, tender acting and feeling is hidden. The acting of all characters is amazing, specially Scarlett Johansson as a mother who resembles humanism in the middle of the atrocities of wars and the brainwashed mindset of the German culture of those days, a mother who tries to teach her boy what she can without disturbing the inner path he choose to walk. Even though her acting stands out, she does not opaque the children actors who personificate tender, struggle and suffering. The opening titles were one of the best I've seen in the last year and the final scene was simple and innocent, but yet full of significance. The humor was well managed, yes, Waititi makes fun on the extremism of the time; but is well used, not disrespectful nor overwhelming, it is precise, and does not disturbs the main message of the film. Perhaps, there were some elements that could have been used in a better way, like the German accent so well used in Inglorious Bastards, but overall Waititi presents a piece of art, a risky project that could divide the opinion of both, critic and audience, but which reminds us of the atrocities of the past, the history that should never be forgotten."
JOJO RABBIT,10 August 2021,9/10,"This movie is great fun! It's shot well, directed really well (well done Taika Waititi), has a great balance of history and humour in a fun way.There is two moments in the movie that totally bring you back to what humanity needs to be reminded of. To love people. This is shown through despair and pain but also through hope and belief in a better world."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2021,1/10,The nazi stuff is not ok. We shouldn't ever be putting things like that out in the world and should not be popularizing this kind of stuff it was in the past exactly where it should stay enough already people.
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is unarguably the most unique movie of 2019. It's a Satirical Comedy which gives the clear message that Taika Waititi could become one of this generation's most loved directors. It stands out and stands high. The most amazing thing about Jojo Rabbit is that it hits you hard with sadness and showers you joy, both with surprisingly high intensity all the while being a Satirical Comedy. For the way it reimagines and delivers a subject that is familiar to the masses, Jojo Rabbit is a memorable movie that will stand the test of time."
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,10/10,"Although I think World at War movies are going on a same trailroad like superhero movies (well not in quantity but we have 2 or 3 every year that tells the tragedy of a certain event for some who were not listening on history class).Simply telling a tragedy as it is especially in Hungary where you also have 2 or 3 more movies (not counting the international movies), that tells you about the suffering. It is hard to get any emotion or story from them anymore. Maybe the first 3 that you choose can shock you but then you will always know what to expect.Regarding Jojo Rabbit the director plays with your feels. By using pauses, comicality of situatuions, and helping the audience to emphasize with the actors.In my view we live in ridiculously politically correct world. The sensitiveness and the ""pretending"" of respect for each other race has gone over the line. However the movie tells you the story in a way that helps you connect with the world of the mid 19's and it will make you crack up, laugh when ever you see a symbol of the german reign."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,10/10,"When the hanging bodies were first shown, it was obvious that each actor was in a harness. This softened the horror for the audience, going along with the unusual tone of the movie in general. But it didn't soften the shock when we see it for the second time. I audibly gasped."
JOJO RABBIT,31 August 2020,1/10,The awful German accent of scarlet Johansson is bad enough. The premise is laughable at best. That said the only funny part was Hitler. And not the characterization but the actor himself. And the lack of a script was noticeable. They could have ended it with the hanging scene and at least it would have been dramatic. The dance at the end just trivialized the whole story.
JOJO RABBIT,15 August 2020,1/10,"Hitler as satire, the killing of Jewish people a comedy? Anyone involved with this should be ashamed. Let's satirize 9/11, try to turn that into a comedy, what the hell would happen? It would be an outrage."
JOJO RABBIT,28 March 2020,10/10,This movie is amazing! I was on an emotional roller coaster throughout the entire movie. Watch it!
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,8/10,"I didn't really know what to expect from this film and I didn't really expect it to enjoy it as much as I did. I was expecting the great comedic aspect of this film (because I love Taika Waititi's work) but, what I was shocked by the most was, how this film also pulls on the heartstrings. It's basically all you could ask a film to be. Great story, hilarious humor, excellent acting and most importantly, it has heart. Definitely one of my picks for Best Picture at this oscars this year. Don't count it out !"
JOJO RABBIT,6 September 2020,8/10,"This movie is great, it's unique and interesting. There are bad moments of course but the film is really good with a lot of character throughout, it's a delightful film but it's not what you expect, trust me."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"Very rarely do we find a movie that can make us heartily laugh-out-loud and yet convey a deeply striking message. These kind are hard to make. But not if you are Taika Waititi!
Jojo Rabbit is a war film that is actually about love. Not the cheesy romantic kind, but the love of friendship and the love of a mother. It's about kindness amidst hate!
In short, it's beautifully paradoxical! It's an adult's film with a kid as the protagonist or perhaps a kid's film with adult themes! I'm not sure, but I absolutely loved it!"
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,9/10,"I watched half the trailer and thought ""meh"".I recently saw it in the cinema (Australia got the film a bit late), and wow, it was probably the one of the best films Ive seen all year (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Lighthouse can't be beat in my opinion but it might be third place for me). I normally don't enjoy comedy films on the same level as more serious films, but I did know I loved the comedic style of Thor Ragnarok so I decided to give it a try.
I was expecting a comedy film about Nazis to be widely panned as being grossly offensive but I was pleasantly surprised at the reviews and awards it got nominated for, and I gotta say, it satirised the living crap out of Nazi Germany, while still somehow remaining tasteful, full of heart, sweet and heartbreaking all at the same time.I've seen a bunch of negative reviews on this film, but reading them, they sure sound like a bunch of downers.The entire cinema was laughing so hard and I was laughing through tears of sadness as well as tears of joy. There were a lot of tears and a lot of laughs.Amazing film."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi adapted and plays a minor (major) role in this film. The humor is never forced and the laughs are genuine. The satire is spot on and every actor puts on an amazing performance from beginning to end. You'll love JoJo, his best friend, his second best friend, his mom, his enemies, his Nazi teacher, and so on. Do not hesitate to see this movie and be ready to rave about it to your friends and family. This movie tops my list for the year."
JOJO RABBIT,25 April 2020,10/10,"First brilleant performance by mother and son and all,
Beautiful film, super characters, super dialogs, interesting scenes, emotional scenes best
Really great film"
JOJO RABBIT,2 May 2020,10/10,It was so good every minute of it something awesome happened I loved everything about it it was so funny and the story was perfect
JOJO RABBIT,11 August 2020,8/10,Fun movie with a very unexpected emotional touch. Great acting by Scarlett Johansson and by the kids
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2021,8/10,What a laugh this movie was! It was so ridiculous I couldn't stop laughing haha
JOJO RABBIT,11 March 2021,9/10,"This film is bizarre, hilarious, heart-wrenching and purely amazing. Taika Waititi has created a masterpiece that perfects the art of satirical films. I found myself laughing quite a bit with in the first few minutes as it was that good. My favourite bit of the has to be the german shepherd joke. Massive love for the set, costume and prop design as they all worked so well together and blended nicely from the contrasting locations of woods to the town. I would defiantly watch it again, and it feels like such a bargain for £5 on DVD from my local supermarket."
JOJO RABBIT,5 June 2021,9/10,"Very funny at one moment and incredibly sad the next. Taika Waititi knows what he is doing, and he did it well. I believe the movie sheds light on the situation during World War 2, but in a comedic way, which does not sound very good, but he proved the opposite, without sugar coating it too much. All in all, everything is well done and it only shows how wicked it was in WW2. I recommend everyone watches this, both for the performances, and the sheer emotion."
JOJO RABBIT,21 July 2021,10/10,"Described on paper, this film seems unlikely to entertain, or even exist. Yet I found it to be an odd and humorous fantasy that arrives at the right message, but just from a very different direction. Great cast, great music. Glad it found an audience."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"Why should I watch this movie? The premise is, odd and where can you go with a film about a boy who's best friend is Hitler? I did watch it. I loved it. The innocence of a young German boy in the Second World War takes you on a journey of laughter and sadness."
JOJO RABBIT,18 December 2019,10/10,"I honestly don't know what I was expecting from this movie. However, I left the cinema with much more than I thought I would.This was the perfect balance of satire, comedy and a message that was loud and clear. We all fear what we don't know and hate is something we are taught.I laughed so hard I felt it in my stomach. I shed a tear and I felt like I needed to dance. This movie is something everyone should see. I cannot recommend this movie enough. The acting was great, the story was original and the humor just on point!"
JOJO RABBIT,31 March 2021,6/10,"I love Taika Watiti and the main characters were cute, but this movie was trying too hard to be bold."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,,"Oh I loved this film. I went in with a head that it was going be be slapstick and silly so appreciated it much more. I thoroughly enjoyed this film it was absurd, it had poignant moments Taika watiti was brilliant, and Roman what a great young actor! My love for Scarlett Johanssen has grown over the years as well she is such a great performer and her character was brilliant.
Oh, the significance of the mums shoes, didn't realise why they kept honing in on them in shots... and then you find out, heartbreaking.
Go see it."
JOJO RABBIT,18 August 2020,10/10,"I understand why there was such hype for this movie, and I am now one that will continue to hype it up. It was so incredibly well done. The imagery, the foreshadowing, the layers, the story - wow!
This is not an easy film to watch, nor should it be. It's meant to make you think and sit with your emotions for a little while.
I think the over the top silliness that others have mentioned before is meant to be just that! Not because it shouldn't be taken seriously, but because it makes you see that it was so much worse in real life.
Then you have such real moments in this film that just breaks your heart & then slowly puts it back together again. Moments that include shoes and black eyeliner (no spoilers here, but once you've seen it you'll understand). Moments of loneliness.
Moments of finally understanding that what you were taught was in fact terribly wrong. Moments of standing up for yourself. Moments of forgiveness. Moments of love.
This is a masterpiece in my books, and I applaud the whole cast & crew for their hard work on this!
Love your neighbours y'all, no matter what. Hate only leads to destruction."
JOJO RABBIT,7 December 2019,10/10,"I am really surprised at the critics who felt this movie crossed a line. If it was even a touch more serious, it wouldn't work at all. Taika Waititi walks the line beautifully. He uses his trademark kiwi humour to lighten the mood in order to be able to talk about these very difficult topics.It is about how we are brainwashed by our society about what is acceptable and what isn't, it is about cruelty, fear, strength. It is about freedom - physical and intellectual. Of course it is about death and war and pain.Amazing performances by all the actors, casting was immaculate!Thank you Taika!! We are blessed to have you in this world!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 June 2020,9/10,"Definitely in my top satire list... Jojo the kid did an amazing job along with rest of the crew but the story will blow you away. There are moments you will laugh but you will also sense the darkness in the humour shown. I think it's a perfect story described how a kid will see and do things in the war when the leader is someone ""like"" hitler. I loved the end where they ended up dancing because that's the only thing they can do.... dance and be happy...."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,9/10,"As another reviewer said; ""Jojo Rabbit was wierd, funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch.""Exactly my sentiments.Goes without saying that Sam Rockwell hits the mark again. As does Taika Waititi!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 April 2020,6/10,"Good acting, witty dialogue, nice little love story.A writer with real guts would have used Muhammed, Osama bin Laden, the Ayatollah Khomeini, Stalin or Mao as his avatar."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,3/10,"Maybe the high score on imdb made me have high expectations of this movie, but still i can say - nothing special"
JOJO RABBIT,13 June 2020,9/10,So beautiful it makes you cry. Brilliant and intelligent comedy on a drama background. Congratulations for this work of art! This is what cinema is about.
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a wonderfully told story of a 10 year old Nazi boy's experiences as he contemplates and evaluates the important relationships in his life during the turbulent end of Adolf Hitler's reign in Germany. This film is fascinating, and it showcases an exceptionally broad array of emotions while never being maudlin. I will be watching this again, and soon."
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,9/10,I went to see this film on my own on the 21st of January. It is a great film done from a child's point of view and really well acted by all concerned in particular by the child actor who plays JoJo and the girl who plays his friend. It has received 6 Oscar nominations and I hope that it wins all of them.
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"Comedy is one of the hardest but best ways to show the pain, drama, problem. It is extremely hard for me to watch movies about war, violence, superiorism, etc.I LAUGHED A LOT, CRIED A LOT, left the hall sobbing and thinking, that Taika is the one.Every performance is gold, every word said is meaningful and powerful.Loved it, thank you!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,5/10,"Watched it with my partner at home on a Sunday evening which is reserved for a good movie. Man...
The first 20min we were on a verge of switching to something else but resisted and ended up stone-faced for the remainder of the film.As pointed out by more critiquing voters: it's humor is quite bland and infantile, thus satire doesn't even stand a chance as its overshadowed by cringe;
The führer overacts, tone change is abrupt, scenes which should be very short are very long, making the movie a boring dragster. Of course its beautifully set and shot but it doesn't matter when the rest is annoying.Normally i dislike it when my partner starts yawning during the movies, but with this one i beat her by at least twice as many"
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2021,9/10,... But wasn't one of top 3 movies of Tarantino. Ooops. Wasn't Tarantino. I Wanted to say Wes Anderson. Oops. Wrong again. Why I thought that? Boys are you sure that two guys wasn't involved? Anyway i liked it.
JOJO RABBIT,19 June 2020,10/10,"I loved it. It really makes me sad to see people deem it boring or, worse, inappropriate. Yes WWII was one of humanity's worst moments. But it's so important that we allow ourselves to look at even the most dire situation through the eyes of humor, if it's done tastefully. Jojo rabbit does just that. There are so many tragic, serious movies that explore almost every aspect of WWII. I thought this was a very fresh take on a (mostly neglected) part of history. The story of how the Nazi party brainwashed their youth. But it's more than just a WWII story. It's a story about how everybody is corruptible, even the gentlest of souls, but also that no one is beyond redemption. That good people can be found I bad situations. It's a coming of age film about friendship, love, loss, about making your own decisions and about the absurdity and surrealism of growing up in the midst of a war. A movie about overcoming mental and physical challenges (neatly metaphored with shoe lace tying). I loved it. I loved the actors. I loved Waititi's interpretation of what young Germans boy's ideas about Hitler might have been during the war. I thought Alfie Allen smashed his minor role. Scarlet was wonderful, as always. It's a good, funny, sincere and genuine movie."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,10/10,"Cannot believe this film, funniest thing I have seen in years, every actor does a great job, fat kid has the best lines. Black humour, some very dark moments, best film I have seen in five years."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,10/10,"This is an amazing movie and please let me tell you why:Awesome satire with criticism towards fir example: war, antisemitism and people who just go with the flow without questioning leaders or politics.Awesome actors, beautiful scenarios.Mixes laugh with tears in an important way.I genuinely loved this movie and really liked that it was told from a child's perspective."
JOJO RABBIT,12 August 2020,8/10,"I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this film. All I had heard about it was that it was about a young German boy whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. Oh, and Scarlett Johanssen was in it.I was surprised at how funny the majority of this movie was, and how sad and touching it is in others. It was an unexpectedly great film."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,"JoJo Rabbit is simply an excellent movie. This film is incredibly funny, and also very charming, and emotional. The performances from all of the actors in this film were great as well. The young boy gives one of the better child performances I have ever seen from a young actor. He is really great, and portrays the character in a complex way, and still has the young innocence you need from a child actor. The movie also deals with very touchy subjects incredibly well. You may think a movie poking fun at Nazi Germany may come off as offensive, or disrespectful, but I never felt that once while watching this film. I also felt the movie doing a wonderful job, at bringing the character together, and you understand why the characters in the film thought how they did. This is a truly great movie, and Taika Wattiti continues to prove he's one of the best filmmakers working today."
JOJO RABBIT,18 September 2020,3/10,"I just could not relate to the characters. I understood where they were coming from, I understood their positions, but this movie just didn't speak to me. I found it dull and slow moving, and frankly, I thought the boy was a bit old for an invisible friend. If the point of the movie was to make me uncomfortable, it failed even in that. To make one uncomfortable, one must at least believe in the characters, and I couldn't. I thought the performance by the central character, the boy, was outstanding given the script with which he had to work. Beyond that, I wish I could get that time back.Other movies I hated this much: Manchester by the Sea, which I found to be a prolonged bout of navel contemplation."
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,10/10,This movie is more than a comedy based on ww2 . It felt like more like a story a boy and her mother. It felt like how war changes our life for a boy. It is beautiful
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,1/10,"Don't waste your time on this. Rarely will you see so much money spent on such a bad movie. I lasted about 15 minutes, right up to the rabbit being offed. Yep that's right. This is a comedy where nothing is funny. Ignore the big budget sock puppet 10* reviews, this film is truly terrible."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,7/10,Good movie with great cast and nice little story with some very funny bits. And also Sam Rockwell is a legend.
JOJO RABBIT,26 October 2019,10/10,"Absolutely the best movie I've seen this year.
Superb acting from a stellar cast made this movie something special. It has everything from Hilarity to outright tragedy. A funny yet at the same time totally chilling performance from Stephen Merchant as a Gestapo agent and an incredible performance from Scarlett Johannson as Jojo's mother make this one of my all time faves.
Do yourself a favour and watch this one."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,10/10,That scene where Jojo picked up the drawing of he and his mother riding bikes together breaks me completely
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,9/10,Wow I really wasn't expecting that. Very rarely does a film have the ability to make you laugh with its quirky humour and then bring you to tears. A brilliant anti war film with a couple of the saddest and poignant scenes I can remember. A must watch.
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,9/10,"I didn't know what to expect from this film, it has no specific genre, it's funny, satiric, dramatic, ironic and generally unique. Outstanding performance of Roman Griffin Davis which takes you into he's world. Filming locations and style are also great."
JOJO RABBIT,5 December 2020,1/10,Hopefully this movie will be interesting for a 10 year old. So much banality and where's the comedy? I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,9/10,"Beautifully shot, surprisingly moving story, and incredible performances"
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,8/10,"Original, very funny, and deep when it needs to be. Well worthy of its Academy Award."
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2019,10/10,"My takeaway from this movie (which I saw with my husband on Thursday and our 16 year old son on Friday) is that we have to watch what garbage our kids consume. If they are exposed to poisonous ideologies, they will be conflicted. In Jojo's case, he had a parent(s) with a healthy moral compass, so he had an anchor at home to guide his better angels. His mother repeated the mantra for the insane time of Nazi rule...""They did what they could."" This referred to people persecuted and killed for thwarting the dictatorship.
I completely took this as satire, and it's still a movie that made me cry for joy and sorrow. I will watch anything Taika Waititi creates, and I hope that he makes more thought-provoking cinema like this. Also, I loved the actor performances in this movie. Nothing was precious, just heartbreaking sometimes."
JOJO RABBIT,14 September 2019,3/10,"It wasnt a terrible movie, but I understand why it will offend many people. I felt guilty watching it and finding parts amusing. It was really hard to enjoy because of these reasons. Im surprised that it was greenlit by a major studio. Would I recommend it? It was good enough to worth the guilt of sitting there watching a Hitler movie. You could at times feel the discomfort of the audience"
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,10/10,"Great movie, was a surprise to me... has great comedy and drama, brilliant performances... must watch"
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,9/10,"The movie, although a tragedy ultimately, having seen some good, honourable people like Rosie and the Captain die, is a great one. It was moving and emotionally incredible. Made me laugh and almost cry (I am a tough cookie to break). There was also love. Imagery was incredible. Jojo seeing the butterfly before his terrible discovery was so good I have no words to describe it. Loved it!!!"
JOJO RABBIT,21 July 2021,10/10,"Comedic but knows when to be serious. Beautiful imagery portrays the young protagonist's naïveté about Naziism which makes for a visually stunning and profound film that takes hold of your heart.I think this film is important. It's both a wonderful essay as well as simply a highly enjoyable piece of cinema. Would definitely recommend to all casual moviegoers, history buffs, artists, and cinema snobs.Taika Waititi has taken the age-old question ""can there be good without evil?"" and flipped the script. His film focuses on slightly different question: Is it always worth searching for the good?"
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a really solid film. Great Performances by the actors, they all feel genuine. Great Comedy, Taika Waititi running around as Adolf Hitler and acting like a moron to mock the real life Adolf Hitler can be hysterical. Nice Motifs that you see show up here and there. And to top it all off, a funny, heartwarming yet tragic story. I definitely recommend this to anyone into film."
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"This movie captures the tragic reality trough comedy.
Its weird but in a beautiful way. loved it."
JOJO RABBIT,10 May 2020,10/10,"For goodness sake, this film is the best!!! At least the Oscars listened. It's called humour, stupid. This film fills you with joy, however also letting you in on the true horrors of the war. Nevertheless, me and my dad had such a good time at the cinema. So to be honest this film is Comedy and only Comedy. In summary 11/10 😂"
JOJO RABBIT,15 June 2020,9/10,"Jojo rabbit is one of the best movies i have seen this year. It is an exceptional world war II movie about a young nazi played by roman griffin davis, directed and screenplay by taika waititi. Taika waititi also won the oscar for this movie in the category of the best adapted screenplay. It is from the novel 'caging skies' written by christine leunens.Jojo is 10 years old and a member of hitler youth, he was bullied many times but he did not gave up. Jojo was friends with adolf hitler and considered him as best friend no.1as no.2 was yorki. In a scene when jojo and adolf are having a conversation and adolf takes off saying he is having unicorn for dinner shows that adolf being best friend is just an imagination of a 10 year old, in the same scene adolf jumps off the window and there was no thud sound added to the scene which indeed meant that it is just an imagination jojo only talked to adolf when he was alone.Taika waititi did great job as adolf hitler and as a director, he mentioned in an interview that he use put himself in the character then direct the scene and i must say roman griffin davis's and thomasin McKenzie's performance is amazing especially the german english accent.
Jojo's dad was fighting in the war and his mother rosie is hiding a jewish girl elsa in the attic when jojo finds out that there is a jewish girl living in attic he made a deal with her that she will never tell jojo's mother that jojo knows about her(elsa) and also she will have to help jojo writing his book which was an exposé on jewish people jojo named it as 'yoohoo jew' since it is not possible to tell the difference between jewish and non- jewish klezendorf suggested that someone should write a book on that subject.Once rosie and jojo went to the town and saw few people hanged for helping jewish people which was considered anti- nazi and was a big deal jojo looked for a second and then turned his head while rosie turns jojo's head back and says 'look' as an acknowledgement of the fact that she might be in same position someday as she was also hiding a jew in her house.I remember a scene where hanging legs of a dead person was shown wearing footwear, later on sadly jojo's mother rosie was discovered as anti- nazi and was hanged in the same way and she could be identified by the footwear she was wearing that scene was poignant.
Talking about cinemetography of the movie,it was amazing and editing is just perfect i personally loved the colours of the movie. Unlike other Hollywood movies most frames were evenly exposed and only intense scenes had darkness, symmetry was also followed in many scenes for example when gestapo officer deertz who is long legged Comes for the inspection at jojo's house with his companions later on captain klezendorf also joins them and in order to have conversation with klezendorf deertz has to look down for the eye contact with klezendorf which was all symmetrical.When gestapo officers and captian klezendorf were inspecting jojo's house elsa pretends to be jojo's late sister and despite getting her date of birth wrong klezendorf lied along and told jojo to look after his family, which proves that klezendorf also felt that war is point less should end soon, after that scene it seems like no one can tell the difference between Jewish or non-jewish.Ending is the best part of the movie, it's a war scene when americans, russians and Indians attacked on nazis, final scene of the movie is about 26 minutes which is so captivating that i didn't blink my eye for once. Nazis loses the war and americans wins, it was Now safe for jews to come out. Elsa asked jojo who won? he lied and said that nazis won but also tells her that she can come out he has figured out a way for her to escape, as soon as elsa step outside of the house she notices a troop riding along with american flag and realises that jojo lied about nazis winning the war and slaps him and both starts dancing as elsa once told jojo that the first thing she would do as soon as war ends is dancing. Movie ends with david bowie's song."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,9/10,"When I tried to describe the plot of Jojo Rabbit my wife, I couldn't quite find the words. Suffice it to say, and same goes for everyone: you should just watch it for yourself.Exemplary acting and an earnest story with a light touch really brings this film to life! It mixes genuine humor with tragedy, violence, commentary... all delivered in an original way. I was moved by it and found myself broadly smiling at the end, but the final minutes may leave you with tears at the same time.Set against the backdrop of the last days of world war II in Germany, a fanatical youth, Jojo idolizes the Nazis. His behavior and ideology is guided by an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (as conceived by a 10 year old boy). Through various interactions, his underlying humanity takes over, and his myopic worldview is put to the test.
That's all I'll say, and reiterate - just go watch.Go see it in a theater if you have a chance."
JOJO RABBIT,13 April 2020,7/10,"Davis and McKenzie as Jojo and Elsa are amazing and absolute standouts. Waititi is borderline unrecognisable as Hitler, I didn't realise it was him until the credits started to roll.Laughs are peppered throughout, as well as sharp moments of reality that jarringly leave the audience feeling empty inside.Despite the bleak subject matter, the film is both delicate and graceful - and whilst I didn't particularly like the pacing in the start, I'd have to say that Jojo Rabbit sets the benchmark of how to tackle any difficult subject matter in cinema."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,8/10,"When I attempted to explain the plot of Jojo Rabbit to a friend of mine, they found it difficult to understand how the events of World War II could be framed as a comedy. ""I hate Nazis"" was their response. I was reminded that the use of an ironic tone can divide audiences between those who comprehend the nuances of meaning and those that don't. For that reason, I appreciate that some viewers may confound the historical context of the film with what it's actually about - overcoming hatred and tribalism.Jojo Rabbit combines Taika Waititi's absurdity with the whimsy of Wes Anderson, culminating in a film that is at once strange and familiar. Its ""melancomic"" tone, which offsets irony and affect with sincerity and pathos, is certainly an Andersonian construct, as is the use of anti-realist settings to give the film a contained and artificial quality.However, Waititi differs dramatically from Anderson in the niceness and likeability of characters who, in Anderson's hands, would most certainly have been depicted as precocious and self-centred. Accordingly, sympathy - particularly towards Jojo himself - is more strongly felt here than in any of Anderson's films. This can perhaps be attributed to Waititi's masterful ability to inhabit the head-space of a young boy. A memorable example is the following interaction Jojo has with his mother:Rosie Betzler: Love is the strongest thing in the world.Jojo Betzler: I think you'll find that metal is the strongest thing in the world, followed closely by dynamite and then muscles.The charming script is of course reliant on a wonderful performance by Roman Griffin Davis, who delivers the above line (as well as many others) with the absolute self-assuredness that young children possess.Waititi has said that Fox agreed to distribute Jojo Rabbit on the condition that he portray Hitler, who is Jojo's imaginary friend in this film. Waititi performs this role with commitment and zest. The character is so clearly a child's understanding of who Hitler would be and is an evocative device for demonstrating how Jojo's perception of the figure changes as the movie progresses. It is a window into Jojo's interiority and understanding of the world around him. I particularly enjoyed watching the imagined Hitler become more menacing as Jojo learns more about the world. It reflects how we so often construct a vision of our idols, and how this changes based on our interactions and experiences.Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen gave strong performances as Captain Klenzendorf and Finkel, an eccentric pair who run the Hitler Youth training camp. I was particularly struck by how Captain Klenzendorf's own disillusionment foreshadows the journey that Jojo himself will undertake . Meanwhile, Finkel's character development can be observed in the periphery of many scenes, providing viewers with an enjoyable easter-egg type experience and lending a re-watchable quality to the film.The decision to cast Stephen Merchant as a captain of the Gestapo was masterful. He is at once creepy and hilarious in this film- his very proportions lent his scenes a sense of physical comedy. In the theatre where I saw Jojo Rabbit, the audience began laughing as soon as he appeared on screen.Jojo Rabbit is a success. It is hilarious and warm, and I will always hold a special place in my heart for a film that ends with children dancing awkwardly to Heroes, followed by an intriguing quote:Let everything happen to you
Beauty and terror
Just keep going
No feeling is finalRainer Maria Rilke"
JOJO RABBIT,23 March 2020,4/10,"I didn't find much humor in the movie, but then I'm not into slapstick or sight gags. The acting is good enough. Anyway, life is full of despair and sadness, so why watch a movie dredging up ancient history that ends on a sour note?"
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2021,10/10,"Seeing some funny scenes on youtube, seeing ""comedy"" tag everywhere near this movie and looking at the poster made me delaying the watch of this Masterpiece. Do not make my mistake. It is VERY (I REPEAT: VERY!!!) robust movie with only a pinch of funny scenes that makes great contrast with everything else that is going on, and also portrey 10 years old ""nazi"" reaction and perspective to whats going on. And whats going on is HEAVY FRICKING DRAMA!!!Characters. Main characters are awesome and very thought out, have many layers.... it really is great job done with them.If you are familiar with the historical context it will be even more pleasant to watch this. If not.... welll you missing a lot but still you can enjoy many many scenes that are understandable no matter of knowledge of historical context. (maybe it will even courage you to learn about it which will be great)Overall its a very very great movie."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2021,4/10,Very boring and overrated movie. Good acting. Get the sympathy from the viewers by adding some sad scenes. If you can read between lines you will see the real message of this movie.
JOJO RABBIT,28 June 2020,10/10,"Reality shown in a funny way, but still shows how cruel laughter can hide"
JOJO RABBIT,15 September 2021,10/10,"This film will appeal and make sense to all ages. You do not have to know bucketloads or anything about the war to easily and completely understand the storyline. It had me on an emotional rollercoaster, I was crying my eyes out and then laughing through my tears. The cinematography is amazing and the storyline has a really beautiful message. Easily one of the best films I have ever seen."
JOJO RABBIT,28 May 2021,10/10,"The humour in this movie is just excellent. If you're a fan of Flight of the Conchords, you will love this. If you're not, I'm assuming you've never heard of it, so watch that after this.The acting is superb, the lead kid (forget his name) will go very far; he handled this role with maturity beyond his years, helped I'm sure, by fantastic direction. This movie had me smiling ear to ear. It's heartwarming, hilarious and an definite must watch. First 10 I've given on IMDb.Watch it! It's an absolute gem."
JOJO RABBIT,21 September 2021,10/10,"One of the few films that made me cry. The tale of a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany brainwashed by the environment he lives in. Roman Griffin Davis played an excellent role guided by his director and co-actor Taika Waititi. The direction is so good, humourous through the first half and it takes a very dark turn for its climax. A great film and worth your time."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,8/10,"This film could not have premiered one moment before now, on the 1st of January 2020 when it actually did in the United Kingdom, anyway thanks to its perplexing subject jagged with almost blasphemous jokes, candid characters and vital lessons.
Maori/Jewish director, Taika Waititi continues to amaze us now with at least about 35% (that being Disney) of the industry backing him. Not to take any credit away from him or being jealous at all (well...maybe the latter)
Titular character Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis), aged very young when he joins the Hitlerjugend which seems like a totally fantastic and undoubtedly the most patriotic experience according to any brainwashed ten-year old living in nazi Germany at the time of WWII. Not far off into the movie we are to realize, as well as Jojo's comrades are that he is not the most suitable person to cue in line and become the Fuhrer's best bodyguard thanks to an unfortunate incident involving an innocent little rabbit (hence the name Rabbit) followed by an even more unfortunate incident with a hand grenade. Luckily, Jojo has the best medical experts at hand and his biggest idol available for him drawn straight out of his imagination - loosely based on reality, of course - none other but the almighty Adolf himself (played comedically by Waititi himself) who is never shy to put our little friend's thoughts back on track with whatever means necessary while the actor/director/writer also does not refrain from ridiculing every possible aspect of the late leader of the Aryan nation. When sticking to more realistic people Jojo is being tutored by his wonderful mother (Scarlett Johansson single-handedly) about love and all good things and by war-crazed amicable veteran Cpt. Klenzendorf (always amusing Sam Rockwell) about...well, not so sure how to address that. Things start to ravel when he discovers a teenage Jewish girl, named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) is hiding behind the walls of their very house and a curious relationship starts to form between the kids. As Jojo learns more about the real world and starts suffering from butterflies in his tummy his faith in the greatest nation and its lunatic leader begins to fade away.
You may think it feels a bit like Roberto Benigni's emotional rollercoaster, 'La Vita e Bella' and you are not the only one but even if it does so we certainly can not blame anyone for having an influence on them especially when the end-product is so perfectly orchestrated with freshened up humour and parodic characters in tragic moments seasoned with trivial but gripping facts from the darkest of hours.
Professionally crafted elements decorate the entire 108 minutes of the film. We shall remain stunned by the glorious - well from the eyelevel of a child, anyway - shots ever so vibrant in colours (less so towards the end signifying the troubling times) delivered by Romanian cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr and by tunes like the good old 'Komm, gib mir deine Hand' by ... wait, what? The Beatles?! Yes, they did that, too. Them buggers. The German version of 'I wanna hold your hand' by England's greatest band respectively, complements the archive footages of chaos fittingly along with David Bowie's 'Helden' as well as many others are doing their part and lifting the spirit with much necessity as we try not to choke on tears crashing down our cheeks witnessing all the innocent and the not so innocent bloodshed the craziness claimed during humanities most desperate times. A little reminder from Waititi for the start of the new decade to be a bit nicer to our fellow comrades, withstand oncoming waves together and especially not to fall behind  manifestos so we could perhaps evade the recurring arms of history.Verdict:8/10
Team Marvel assembled their best and most capable with added charm from the newly appointed 11 year-old superhero to pull the Rabbit out of the hat just in time for this year's award gala. Well, they did it f*ing brilliant"
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2020,10/10,"Third generation German American, I was resistant to seeing this film. I remember asking European relatives -- as only a child would -- ""Why did you follow Hitler?"" Their answer: ""He told us we were the most important country in the World, he'd make us great again -- and rich.""With what's going on in our Country now -- I understand those people much better..."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"The movie is definitely up there, at the all time top.
It describes WW2 from the angle of a child and this is something, to my knowledge, that has never attempted before. Taika Waititi, explores the concept from a unique prospective in a very original way. What I love most about this movie, is that it unravels boldly the idea of, how idiotic the entire concept of racism is and how the mass is being manipulated by individuals in doing things that are completely inhuman. It is sad that it still happens today.
I believe it is first movie that has ever been nominated for best Comedy and Drama at the same time. At least Google does not return any result for the key: ""movies that have been nominated for both best drama and comedy"".
In my opinion, it should win at least 10 Oscars, including:
Best actor
Best actress
Best supporting actor
Best director
Best picture
Best supporting actress
Best writing adapted screenplay
Best costume design
Best production design
Best film editing
Best drama
Best comedyBoth Sam Rockwell and Taika Waititi deserve the Oscar for Best supporting actor.
Taika Waititi should get the Oscar for Best writing adapted screenplay and Best director, not to mention that the movie deserves the Oscar for best movie, of course.
Roman Griffin Davis, totally deserves the Oscar for Best actor. His acting is of the scale! Something that you don't see often at this young age.
I don't know if Scarlett Johansson deserves the Oscar for Best supporting actress, however her performance was up there and I believe that if she had a longer role, she would totally deserve it. I am waiting for the special edition Bluray with the extended scenes, to see more of her.
Archie Yates was fantastic and he and Sam Rockwell got the best lines in movie. If his role was longer he would probably be nominated for Best supporting actor too. However, this is what happens when you compress the movie for the theater. I am waiting for the special edition Bluray with the extended scenes, to see more of him.
Bottom line: The movie is exceptional. Does it deserve to be watched? OMG: Absolutely! I have seen it over 10 times so far and I can't stop watching it. It is a shiny ray of hope in the dystopian world we still live in. Don't miss it! :)"
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"WOW what an incredible movie! Sarcasm and humor, that smacks head on into a row of lynched bodies, bringing you face to face with the real horror, heartbreak, and hope of humanity. This is my Best Movie of 2019. 👏"
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,"A very unique concept ... loved it! Great acting, especially the children. Look for this at award-time!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,9/10,This is an excellent movie that reveals the view of war from a child's perspective. It's utter nonsense should make us all pause and realize war is worthless.
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,10/10,"I didn't initially know what to expect from it. It definitely was a good comedy and it delivered the laughs, what was surprising how it can break your heart as well and make you feel a little bit upset that Jojo had to live in a time like that. It was definitely thought provoking and im actually happy that it was a film based on the German's side. I grew up watching WWII Hollywood Films...it's eye opening the see what war was like from the other side as well. Also it helps to have a good knowledge of World War 2, not necessary, but definitely made the punchline funnier."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,1/10,"Belongs in the category ""Movies this world does not need"". I don't know what target audience this movie is meant for. First of all it is ALWAYS silly and stupid watching a US/UK movie about the german side of WWII. No german actors and everyone speaks in their own US/UK accent. That has always been a downer when a movie director doesn't give two cents about authenticity. The mock german accent is simply ruining everything. US/UK actors should never impersonate germans... PERIOD.The movie is just unbearable and hard to watch. Nothing can be taken seriously and the idea of an imaginary Hitler friend is just... welll... bizarre at best. How can this utter piece of crap been nominated for 6 academy awards??? How far has the movie industry come?? I guess they are running out of ideas. Apart from sequels and prequels and remakes they only seem to produce utter crap these days."
JOJO RABBIT,28 May 2020,10/10,This is the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan! If I could rate it 11 I would because it is just a bit better than a 10!
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"Where do I begin? This movie is amazing. And that's an understatement. There are elements that will leave you laughing hysterically, and moments where your heart breaks uncontrollably. I found myself multiple times throughout the film with my mouth wide open, in awe that I was watching this beautiful film. And on top of all that, its message is something that is so helpful for these times.The Germans were practically brainwashed to hate the Jews and a variety of others, and we've all seen countless films showing that. But it's fascinating just watching a 10 year old boy study the life and background of a Jew, slowly realizing they have much more of a common ground. It turns itself from ""The Producers"" to a heartfelt and powerful message.It's a beautiful film. And one that really anyone can enjoy. The message is certainly something for this world today and I hope you love it like I did :)"
JOJO RABBIT,5 June 2020,10/10,"This movie is a absolutely underrated masterpiece.
Stop reading now and watch the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,9/10,"Oh my God. Just that. Laughter, tears, shock. Amazing, a real triumph. Will remember this film for the rest of my life."
JOJO RABBIT,24 May 2021,6/10,"Totally unnecessary and pointless movie, and not funny at all.And funny is the least thing that comes into my mind when it comes to Hitler.You may want to see instead:
The Downfall
Schindler's List
The Boy in the striped Pijamas."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,10/10,"Normally I'd go into excessive detail but this was way more than what I thought it'd be.. I'm actually really glad they took a younger-generations perception of the times in Germany during the war. Made everything more realistic and relatable, because sadly a large part of the fascist movement was lead by ignorant child-like populism and indoctrination was just a part of everyday life where everyone was expected to act a certain way and speak/think through blind-fanaticism.The illustration of war from a childs' perspective and the inclusion of some of the grossest details of war being portrayed in a comedic/satirical sense was just amazing.One of the most capturing moments for me was when it came down to the Nazis strapping grenades to children in a last-ditch effort to kill as many people as possible, and that woman says ""Just shoot anyone that looks different than you.""
That is why the world went to war against this ideology.I enjoyed it more the second time around.. I look forward to this movies' affect of our current generation of childish, selfish, ignorant, racist, nationalistic conspiracy theorists incapable of empathy/awareness/compassion for human life."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,10/10,"Excellent movie! The story of a young boy discovering who he really is during wartime Germany is amazing. The comedy of Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, and the cast nailed a perfectly paced story. The cinematography, lighting design, and costuming was amazingly well done. Though the story gets slow by Act 3, the story kept me involved from start to finish. I highly encourage anyone to see this film!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 December 2019,8/10,"I find this a beautiful, funny and sometimes heartbreaking film. It reminded me somewhat of Brazil by Terry Gilliam, vibey-wise.I was a bit shocked because I didn't see the emotional parts coming and found myself suddenly with a very stuffed nose and teary eyes."
JOJO RABBIT,2 April 2020,9/10,"I watched this movie like I was watching my own childhood and teenagehood!If you wonder why, I must say that I am Iranian.Iran's education system is somehow similar to what we see in this movie. Each student will learn to hate on US and Israel without knowing exactly why and fed up with so many lies about any country identifies as enemy by Islamic republic ideologies.
Most of the Iranians will understand all the lies behind this system as soon as they become old enough to think and read and watch by their own so when they reach their 20s they are all different from what they were in the past.
And I completely understand the feeling of Jojo when he found himself in a situation when all the things you have been learning become a BIG LIE.This movie is a masterpiece in writing and showing people what dictatorship do to little kids.It is also a great movie in technical aspects with absolutely stunning performance of Roman Griffin Davis. This kid's future is so bright!
And I believe Scarlett Johansson is robbed in the Best Supporting Actress category.She deserved it."
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2020,3/10,"This is a bad imitation of life is beautiful in the style of Wes Anderson. The director is a very able person that's obvious. The film is shot well, but the story has simply no idea about the subjects it is touching. And it's really irritating to see it crushing under."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,9/10,"The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.
The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope [...]
No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything [...]
It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.
When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself.
We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.
All art is quite useless.
Oscar Wilde."
JOJO RABBIT,2 August 2020,9/10,"The movie is as good as expected. Its storyline is not that unusual. But I really appreciate how absurdity, humanity, crudeness, warmth are well displayed by each the characters."
JOJO RABBIT,30 March 2020,9/10,"Taika Waititi navigates across the dark and sensitive coast line of arguably the world's biggest tragedy with a compass of heartfelt and humanitarian grace, gently breezed by the wind of palpable yet fallible characters of which turn a treacherous stormy night into an all but too enjoyable voyage.
The feather-weight touches from Scarlett Johansson outstanding performance as the motherly embodiment of a bitter sweet symphony, as she finds the star in the darkest of nights, sail the film steady - whilst Davis fills the screen with his aptly bouncing personality. McKenzie is, as ever, posthumously mature beyond her years and dangerously talented.
As with all of Waititi's masterpieces, the comedy becomes the catalyst for the heartbreak, which throughout all of his cinema, from Hunt for the Wilderpeople to even Ragnarok, drops like a hammer right through the heart it was previously coaxing. Such tragedy, wrapped in the warm layer of such lovable character-driven comedy, is a honey-pot of emotion that makes the film enchanting regardless of the gravity of its context.
Yet, taken into context, it indeed ascends into something timeless.
Although, in my opinion, it is not Waititi's best work and the film is far from perfect - with it's overall aesthetic residing more as a cheese toastie instead of a filet mignon - Waititi prises open the doorway to our darkest demons, endorsing and encouraging us, like we all should from studying history, to anachronistically learn from the past... and learn that, with just enough cheese, even Hitler can be funny."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,9/10,"""I'll let you in on a little secret. The rabbit is no coward. The humble little bunny faces a dangerous world everyday, hunting carrots for his family, for his country. My empire will be full of all animals, lions, giraffes, zebras, rhinoceroses, octopuses, rhinos, octopuses, even the mighty rabbit.""Some might imagine the rabbit to be weak as it doesn't have claws, sharp teeth or wings and scurries around, running and hiding. But the fact that rabbits still exist and haven't gone extinct, they still go out everyday, in the face of the danger that awaits them and risk it all, they are the bravest of all.
This little boy is surrounded by Nazis and is himself brainwashed by the propaganda. But he doesn't fit in, killing and plundering isn't for him. With all the bravery he can muster, he tries to protect his mom and the Jewish girl, Elsa, she is hiding, fighting his own imaginary friend in the process and all his conditioned beliefs."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,1/10,"About 3 minutes into this film I just knew I wouldn't like it. It might be some people's thing but the comedy is just so juvenile. Yea, it's a 12 and marketed around a young boy and his imaginary friend Hitler, so what do you expect? But really it felt like that typical American Will Ferrell/Adam Sandler slapshtick. Hitler was probably the funniest part of this film just for the stupidity of it, but is fat man in funny moustache an original idea? No. I'm sure there's a million and one better portrayals of this idea somewhere in Hollywood.Also, and this was the deal-breaker for me, is the weird directing decision to make the narrative of this story so skittish and nonsensical. All throughout, the story just doesn't feel continuous & always lacking in context, and then about half-way through it becomes largely one-room based. It just didn't feel like a film, but more like a vaguely connected series of skits with mild attempts at bittersweetness in it.These attempts at bittersweetness didn't really work for me either. There are bits in the film where it's nice to see the delusion of German people at the time, the hopelessness of it, the comedy disguising the horrors going on around them, but it's so understated and surrounded by dry attempts at comedy that it becomes hard to take seriously. The tone's all wrong.The acting's alright, but for some reason they make everyone have German accents. Maybe for comedy, but they never make a joke around German mispronunciations or anything like that, so I was just distracted by how bad the accents were most of the time. Everyone just sounded Russian or braindead.If you wanna watch this film with your kid, it might be alright. There's some sensitive ideas expressed but they probably won't notice as they'll be too busy laughing at Hitler (fantastic). Just don't be fooled by the good reviews as I don't think they're reflecting the actual QUALITY of the film, but more just it's 'humour'"
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,7/10,"Movie was directed well, acted well, shot well etc but struggled with being a decisive genre. Went from being a comedy to a romance to an action movie. Had it focused on one genre it would have succeeded."
JOJO RABBIT,22 June 2020,7/10,"I have mixed feelings here, I laughed a few times and Scarlett Johansson was AMAZING. It was educational on how things were back then and it was executed good but thats all."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed the film, but it wasn't too memorable. I liked Scarlett Jo's performance but that's about it. I never found any parts of the movie funny, but the flat jokes weren't terrible I guess. Some parts did had me tearing up. It's a decent movie."
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,10/10,"The cinematography is great, the story is great, the comedy is great, and the characters are great. A combination of humor and a meaningful story. Better than I expected it to be."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,10/10,"JoJo Rabbit is an exceptional film. Not only is the star-studded cast immensely talented, but the script and cinematography are breathtaking.It manages to be a deeply moving and emotional story about one of the most difficult chapters in human history, while still adding the subtle hits of satire.Overall, this is a definite 10/10!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,"I dont get any words on this movie...... at first the little jojo shocked me with his mature expressions. Second the movie shacked me with number of thaughts on war, race, etc.... on the certain period through funny stuffs.. on third it melt me with the story line on certain circumstance......Its a must watch movie to all kind of people"
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2019,10/10,"This is a great movie for all to see. Contains laugh out loud humour, and emotional scenes."
JOJO RABBIT,17 May 2021,1/10,I'm not sure that likening the Hitler youth to beatles mania is the best way to introduce this tragic and unfortunate period in our history. Obviously film is subjective and everyone sees something different in it but I don't think comedy is the right medium to use to tell this story.
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,10/10,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I'm a big fan of Taika Waititi and Jojo Rabbit did not disappoint. The cinematography was stunning and the acting was superb and on point, and a big shoutout to Scarlett Johansson for her amazing work in it! I hope it takes home many awards after award season is over!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 September 2020,8/10,"I can't imagine the elevator pitch for this movie. It must have been wild getting funding and distribution. Somehow they pulled it off and delivered a phenomenal movie. Most movies about Nazis are heavy and grim. Waititi puts a wild spin on the genre. At the end I had what can only be described as a feeling. I can't fully explain it, but it was new for me. Kind of tickled."
JOJO RABBIT,24 June 2020,10/10,"If anyone could make a caricature of Adolf hitler, it must be Taika Waititi. An amazing movie that makes you feel happy and sad, makes laugh and still feel the depth of the pain and suffering that people were forced to endure. The kid was just perfect. You couldn't help but simply adore him for his innocence and ambition. Loved the movie. The best Nazi Germany movie, ever made!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,3/10,"Not much happens in this movie. It's a movie with a unique idea, but that's about it. After the first 10 minutes the charm of the idea wore off and left me waiting for something to happen. Stuff does happen, but very slowly and not much of it. I could probably some up the entire story in a just a few sentences, but I don't want want to spoil it.The best way to enjoy this movie is to go into it thinking, ""what unique idea."" Then reminder yourself that every 5 min. Also, tell yourself the many mildly funny moments are hilarious. Laugh out loud, especially if you don't feel like it. Lastly remember you are supposed to like this movie. If you don't then you aren't smart enough to get it. So you better like it."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,4/10,Boring and when you came to think that could be fun in some parts its just annoying
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"It's amaizing realy amaizing i laught a Lot, one of my favorite Moovie of 2019"
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,2/10,"Well there are now three categories of film Good Films, Bad Films and those that really test your tolerance levels sadly this is the latter!
What I don't understand is why all the hype? What is in the slightest way satirical about Nazism and the Holocaust. Of course, this has all been done before with both Mel Brooks The Producers and To Be or Not to be the difference being that both those productions were done with an element of taste. Personally, I'm convinced that both these productions were thrown in the dryer with a kid and a little bad taste and out popped JoJo Rabbit!...I Gave it 40 minutes and then went into the bedroom with a glass of wine and watched my paint dry.....a lot more fun!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,8/10,"75 years after the end of World War //, we continue to struggle with the unfinished business of lessons learned. For me, it's interesting to see how each new generation chips away at this problem. We are now far enough away from those most directly affected to explore new paths that previous generations found too painful to venture.In some respects, I see the main character JoJo as a metaphor for the German people. They willingly boarded a train they thought would bring them greatness but instead, too late, realized they were on a runaway freight train to hell. The story is told in deeply personal way this time. No sweeping battles or mass executions. Instead, big themes are stripped down to essential elements that leave the viewer with nowhere to retreat or hide. The satire and dark humor, however, gives some reprieve from the shock and horror of Nazi tactics used to maintain control and to force regular people to commit unspeakable acts. Unfortunately, the ending provides no message on how to avoid a similar fate in the future."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,10/10,"I went into this thinking that it would probably be a pretty fun movie, but it ended up hitting like a truck with it's emotional moments. My favorite movie of 2019."
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,9/10,"I've been wanting to watch Jojo Rabbit since a pretty long time now but I was repelling it because I wasn't so sure about the mix between Nazi Germany and comedy, it felt kinda off-putting at first. But oh was I wrong!To put it simply, Jojo Rabbit is an EXCELLENT movie. It's fascinating to see the Nazi propaganda through the eyes of a 10 year old boy (Jojo), a proud Hitler Youth fan, who is trying to find his place in this complex world. The comedy is brilliant and it's overall a pretty original take on a Nazi satire.This movie touched me deeply. Some scenes are jaw-dropping, I wasn't prepared for that. Please give this movie a chance, you will be surprised and you won't regret it."
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2019,10/10,"Taika Waititi has a filmography filled with magic tricks of tone -- whether he's reinventing a shakespearean superhero with improv or layering comedy into the life of an abandoned child, he's got a touch that nobody else has. He brings that expertise to JoJo Rabbit to make the most uplifting, optimistic, hilarious Nazi movie that's ever made me cry. There truly is no way to describe this film that does service to Waititi's ability to walk a tonal edge that makes JoJo Rabbit into a truly singular film; there is no other film quite like it."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2021,9/10,"Just wow. A thrilling and hilarious take on the evils of WWII. The tone was appropriate while at the same time was able to leave me crying both from laughter and sadness. A true example of what it means to be your own person, and not to remain in a cancerous box that only cares for you as a number. Just beautiful"
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,9/10,"Wonderfull actors, good choice of music, and a lovely tragicomedy"
JOJO RABBIT,8 July 2020,2/10,"A movie with sloppy writing and pretentious execution that asks quite a bit from its audience. Seems eager to position itself on the right side of history and playfully joke about nazis, but fails to compel us to really join the ride or provide a reason for its existence, merely scratching the surface on both comedy and melodrama levels.Jojo surfed on some hype, but will prove itself forgettable and cringe-worthy in the future. There isn't even enough for a moral discussion concerning this movie, because unlike The Producers, which at least develops comedy and provokes reflection, this is but cheap opportunistic plastic with decent advertising.I'm giving it two stars for the adorable Yorki, which is fabulous and should have been the main."
JOJO RABBIT,7 May 2020,8/10,"Just watched it again and enjoyed it just as much the 2nd time. Such a unique film that both tears at and warms your heart. Taika Waititi proves once again he really can do it all, and remarkably well! Hope he keeps amazing us with his work. Might also be time to re-watch his movie, ""What We Do in the Shadows"". SO funny!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 May 2020,9/10,"A boy who has been brainwashed since he was a child accidentally finds that the whole world is a lie. The Jews stood in front of the secret police, who could not recognize them. At that moment, he had doubts about everything around him. Perhaps the Nazis he fanatically followed were not the embodiment of justice. Perhaps the evil twisted Jews in people's mouth were no different from others. However, the most difficult thing is not to be kept in the dark, but to choose after knowing the truth. You can drift with the current and pretend nothing has happened, or you can go against the current and fight against the darkness to the end. Just as mother and Capt. christendo kept sober in the current of the times and did not lose themselves. A minute of heat, a minute of light, makes the firefly general, but also a little light in the dark, do not have to wait for the torch. He finally awakened to his self-consciousness, took over the baton of responsibility and responsibility from his predecessors, waved goodbye to his past self and threw himself into the arms of freedom. Dance, no war"
JOJO RABBIT,24 June 2020,9/10,"I dont laugh easily, but this movie made me laugh a lot. But its not just a simple comedy, it also has a great way to show a terrible side of our history. You may even shed a tear or two."
JOJO RABBIT,6 December 2020,10/10,"A genuinely beautiful balance between comedy, love, wit and the earth shattering trauma of war. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 September 2020,9/10,What a tricky tricky sub-subject to tackle. This film is different and clever enough to have Adolf Hitler used as a non offensive imaginary friend of a young boy. It expresses the wild imagination that such a youth can have but so much more than that is what he learns on this moral and social journey. I don't believe there is a film like it.
JOJO RABBIT,14 December 2020,7/10,"Taika Waititi is one of those director's whose personality comes through the screen and Jojo Rabbit is not exception. And here, with him playing one of the main characters, it's almost undeniable. Great performance from all actors and great movie overall!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 September 2019,10/10,"This was another of Taika at his best. Taking him back to his bittersweet indie roots, his storytelling and humanity shows through at every moment. A story of a 10 year old nazi youth in full swing of his country's ideology indoctrination, he starts his journey with his invisible best friend Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi himself) going off to Hitler Youth camp. His mother is a wild and endearing woman with a playful attitude during this horrible time of war. The movie starts off hilariously, but it takes a little bit of time to allow yourself to feel okay laughing at this side of the german war and this little boy who wants nothing more than to do right by his fuhrer. After a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, and the discovery that his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic, his ideals are turned upside down to the thoughts on the war he has grown up with. It's a simple message delivered in a way that tells you what you already know. Facism is bad. It's a story that Taika tells us needs to be told over and over again, because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are a great pair and carry the film with warmth and wonderful comedic scenes, but it's Scarlett Johansson who leaves us with the memory of what it means to be on the right side of humanity, and to take life as it comes and teach your children what you can, when you can. Even surrounded by well-known and substantial actors, these two children stand out and bring the movie's warm embrace. Taika is never afraid to lead with a joke, but he always takes the time to bring his message of humanity home by hanging on the sad moments of life too, not jumping over life's tragedies to get to the next one-liner. He balances the good with the bad perfectly, leaving you walking away with a warm feeling in your belly."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2021,10/10,"This movie came as a bit of a surprise for me. It's very similar to Life is Beautiful, at least on the emotional impact of the film.The movie starts off very silly. As a matter of fact, I was about to turn it off thinking it's a movie that makes Hitler look like a funny man. But as the film went on, I was taken aback. The emotional impact of the movie is significant where you just want to jump in there and save the characters yourself to set things right. I think the movie done a wonderful job at illustrating what Nazi-era Germany must have been like at the start. The main character Jojo very much believes in his country and their mission. So much so, that even his mother helps him out to make sure he keeps this idea going. She tries to make it appear innocent, even getting the local Hitler-youth Captain to play along with Jojo's ideal about Germany. Then, when Jojo realizes his mother is hiding this Jewish girl, Elsa, she even plays along with Jojo realizing that he isn't a bad person and later on Jojo realizes Elsa, the ""evil"" Jewish person isn't so bad despite having to author a book on the evils of someone who is Jewish. In the film, one of the great mysteries is Jojo's father. Jojo's mother obviously really misses her father, and the local youth Captain seem to know Jojo's father. Jojo's mother made Jojo believe his father was a heroic German soldier who died protecting Germany's ideal but as the movie went on, we learn that even Jojo's father is more than just simply what was described to him. Jojo's imaginary friend happened to be Hilter himself and by the end of the film, even his imaginary character falls apart but still shields Jojo from the true evils of this world. At first, it seems like a bad idea, but we learn that everyone is trying to protect Jojo, even when Jojo realizes the evils of this world, he's shielded from it.By the end of the film Jojo realizes everything himself and realizes that it is all a sham. Even Jojo's imaginary Hitler friend ends up defeated and Jojo realizes his one true partner left in this world, Elsa is worth going back to reality of things. Jojo lost everything and everyone who shield him in the end except Elsa and they're both know what is right now.It's really a great film. I really felt a lot of great emotional parts that flows very well. The ""comedy"" aspect of it is so ridiculous that it plays very nicely into the overall film."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2021,1/10,"I didn't like the movie overall, starting from the gae fuhrer to the fake acting of the main character, it's what i hate about letting kids act, sometimes their preformance is so fake and unreal, the main character is a ten year old that talks the way a 20 year old would talk, which makes it look so unconvincing, i wasted my time watching it"
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2021,8/10,"Thoroughly enjoyable dark comedy about an obsessed young boy who has succumbed to the infamous Nazi propaganda. He thinks he is obsessed with Hitler and the third reich but gradually changes his mind on meeting a young Jewish girl his mother is hiding. He is surprised to discover she is just a normal young girl. Their friendship blossoms and is fun to watch, as are the scenes with his friend Yorki. Despite succeeding mostly as a comedy it carries some strong moral messages on friendship & humanity.
Well worth a watch and you can see why it received Oscar recognition."
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,6/10,"I know it's not OK to compare, especially if films were done with such a time distance, in completely different geographies (think local vs. global), for different audiences. Anyway, Eagle vs Shark remains one of the most lovely, original, endlessly funny films for me, and because of that film I was following Taika's career development for more than 10 years. I am sad that with his big career, he's lost his valuable sources that fed his true creativity, quirkiness, weirdness that actually brought him to this place. And probably, that's not all he's lost. I am sure he also misses himself, in his private 1 on 1 moments, and it must be a tough realisation. Hmm, making films as you want them, with smaller crews, a lot of friends and family who keep on inspiring you throughout the process vs. giving yourself into the machine that feeds you fame and money, but gives you tasteless, plastic ingredients for your dish. It can look as your signature project, but the taste... Takes some magic, and this guy's lost it.
I expected more from Thor, too, but I understood that the creative ""influence"" he could have there must have been minimal. So, I was hoping to see more in Jojo. Was so happy he got nominated for Oscars, without even seeing the film. Oh, boy. (Remember Boy? So lovely. ) Can't imagine how awesome this film could have been if it was made by original Taika, unposessed by the living ghost of Hollywood's emptiness. It's sad how many talents sell their soul for immortality within the machine while they need to die as authors as soon as they get inside. But maybe, that's also an easy way out. To remain big for real, it takes more than ego.
Jojo? Nice concept. Cute Hitler. Watching it... Boring and dull. Charmless. Messy. Scarlett... Such a bad casting. No character in any character. Nothing. Even the illustration scrapbook doesn't have character. Music? Must be an awesome novelty for the Hollywood films audience. Sorry but also, addtheprefix-exploitation. Huge luck to get so far with this mediocre film.
Truly hope to see more of what this could have been.
Not a disaster, tho 😉"
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,3/10,"Enjoyed the acting, especially, kids.
However, at its core, the movie is very shallow and, dare I say, dangerous. The danger is for the younger generation that is going to watch it - they do t really know anything about the war in which 50 million people perished and by watching this they will get a completely wrong idea. Yes, I get it, it's not a historical movie, yet it is what our kids are more likely to see, instead of picking up a book or watching documentaries.
And Jojo Rabbit trivialises nazism, making it look rather like a pathetic joke instead of tragic, violent, brutal and extremely dangerous.
It mocks German language, linking Nazis to the German accent, where there is very little need for it.
And, to top it up, Russian army is presented as villains executing prisoners of war, including little kids, American army is presented in an extremely positive light, twisting the history.
No wonder several public officials claimed its allies and not Red Army liberated Auschwitz. That's exactly the issues I've got with this film and other films that choose to turn the most devastating war into a laughing matter."
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,10/10,"At first glance I thought the Jojo Rabbit would be largely a spoof/comedy on the Nazi regime of WWII. This is a very dark comedy.The plot, directors, and actors of Jojo Rabbit forge a diverse range of story and emotions. This movie is far, far better than first glance.One of the best current movies of 2019/2020."
JOJO RABBIT,4 March 2020,9/10,"This belongs in a serious subgenre of dark comedy along with The Great Dictator and Life is Beautiful and its goldmine seldom harvested (understandably) but films like these make me wonder how bad The Clown Who Cried could really be? Jerry Lewis is a comic genius and had a real personal reverence for the seriousness of the matter which is how dark comedies work. Look at Life of Brian. As long as satire isnt treated like a Family Guy cutaway you can make comedy out of anything Dr Strangelove, Blazing Saddles etc"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,1/10,"This is utter garbage movie. Nothing hilarious about it, people that rate this 10 stars are underpaid liars."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,9/10,"This movie..... those kids......
Starts a bit slow, kinda weird-ish. But when you get familiar with it, it just constantly extract feelings off of you. Caught myself smiling while i was almost in tears.
Great work!"
JOJO RABBIT,4 March 2020,10/10,"What a beautiful film. It was moving, funny, artistic, clever, made-you-think - just breathtaking. Wipes the floor with Parasite."
JOJO RABBIT,1 December 2020,9/10,"I was hesitant about seeing Jojo Rabbit, because the commercials made it seem like a Wes Anderson movie, who I am not a fan of. This movie is so much better than any movie Wes Anderson has ever made. It is one of the best movies of the last 10 years.Like a Coen brothers movie, it gets funnier everytime you watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2020,10/10,"Seen all yer mans movies this one is the best so far. Just so off the wall - funny, sad, deep, surreal and historically incorrect - Watched it with my wife one Saturday afternoon and would recommend it for anyone stressed and just wanting a break from reality."
JOJO RABBIT,11 April 2020,9/10,This movie is perfect exception of how well known story can be told from completely different angle. Someone had a guts to make a movie like this and succeeded to make it amazing.
JOJO RABBIT,23 March 2021,1/10,"In my opinion...
The jokes made in the film just aren't smart or deep enough to successfully satirise it's complex subject matter. They are kind of childish and shallow. That may be what Waititi was going for, but I'm not a child so I didn't find them very funny.
Most of the characters are characatures rather than characters. The German accents the actors put on are inauthentic and distracting. Johansen's accent sounds french a lot of the time.
JoJo's scars are invisible in most of the scenes despite being the punchline of many jokes.
The conceit that JoJo can't tell his mother that he knows about Elsa and that Elsa can't tell JoJo's mother that she knows about him is contrived.
The dialogue is meandering.
Many of the scenes with Rosie are boring and corny. I didn't feel anything when she died apart from manipulated. The narrative of the good non racist in a racist time or place is over used and uninteresting at this point.
Tonally, it's all over the place.
It's excessively crowd pleasing and pandering. The film uses pop music to elicit emotions we associate with that music, but it's unearned and lazy.
The message? Love eachother. Dont be like Nazis. Wow! That's really deep. I bet no one has ever thought of that before!
The message is boring, clichéd, overly simplistic. The film says nothing new or interesting. Skip it."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,5/10,"Taika Waititi is no Wes Anderson.I'm not even a huge fan of Anderson's, but he certainly can make a visually stunning (hence entertaining) movie without much of a story, or rather...with a story that can be summarized in a few sentences. But the result is still lovable for it's quirkiness.I guess this is what Waititi was shooting for. He missed by a huge margin. It's not the lack of visually interesting scenes (thought still not in the same league with Anderson). It's the general topic, that makes the lack of story feel very off. It's a setting that shouldn't allow for such a void.Pretty much every of the characters feel unbelievable or at least underdeveloped. I understand this is a comedy, but good comedies required especially good writing.War is depicted as abstract, with little impact on every day life (in terms of conveniences). Everything is pretty much just talk until the last act and everybody seems well off.Apart from the last act, not much happens in terms of a plot.I don't see this movie as potentially offensive in any way, because it doesn't really dare an unpleasant perspective. Nazis are always depicted as idiots or caricatures. Everybody is a victim of the circumstances.The message seemed especially odd to me. Where you would expect it to take either the road to moralize heavily, or point out that good or bad are hardly ever cut clearly, the movie appears to say: ""Good or bad are a part of life anyway. Don't bother.""I beg to differ."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,1/10,"I knew a lady who was at Auschwitz. She and her mother faced Dr. Mengele, she went to the right, her mother to the left. This film trivializes the deaths of the six million Jews who were killed by Hitler and the 70 plus million who died in World War II. It's not funny at all and has no redeeming values."
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,8/10,How does he do it? Taika Waititi is a comedy genius to say the least. There were moments where I laughed my ass off. There were moments where I cried my eyes out. How Taika was able to pull that off giving the premise of the movie is beyond me. If you go in this movie expecting just a comedy with Taika Waititi dressed as Hitler then you're gonna be in for a surprise. Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster.
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2019,10/10,"One of the best written, and funniest satires I've seen since Mel Brooks. . . The characters were engaging, and wonderfully over the top. . . a brilliant film."
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,5/10,"Saw the trailer and was intrigued, but the movie left me somewhat stunned. Not at all what I was expecting. There were funny bits but they never lifted me out of the extraordinary sadness. Found it difficult to stay to the end but glad I did for Sam Rockwell's final scene."
JOJO RABBIT,5 July 2020,9/10,"How can a film about a kid and Adolf Hitler be funny?That is what I asked myself, but this film does it, and so much more.Funny, sensitive, compelling, harrowing and hope giving, wrapped up in beautiful cinematography and supported by a quality soundtrack.A special film."
JOJO RABBIT,15 May 2020,10/10,"I rarely ever give 10 stars, as I reserve it for movies that are essentially perfect, that changing any flaws would make it worse. Jojo Rabbit is one of the 4 movies I consider in this category. Its fun, emotional, deep and action packed at the same time. Scarlet Johanson plays Jojos mother brilliatnly, just as Taika plays imaginary Hitler. It is really hard to say anything negative about the movie, every character is really well scripted, the story is amazing, the only negative I can say that it may seem like it is suitable for kids (under 12) but it is NOT, so do not watch it as a family movie sunday afternoon. Other than that best movie since the Dark Knight."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2021,4/10,"The movie starts as ww2 parody, then continues as a Wes Anderson style film (two young children having an adventure) and then ends up as a ww2 drama. At the end it doesn't deliver any of these 'genres' properly. I think the story was good but missed the chance when trying to combine so many elements in 2 hours."
JOJO RABBIT,22 August 2020,10/10,Jojo Rabbit WILL make you feel. It is one of the finest stories I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
JOJO RABBIT,2 April 2020,1/10,"Well if this is satire than , no I don't get it. But frankly it's simply not funny, certainly a bit deranged. Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time. I lost 45 min of my life that I'll never get back. I couldn't take any more."
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,7/10,"It is surely one of the best films of the year. Although, if you expect something accurate historically, you should lower your expectations. This is a nice film that tells the human side of a german family, in which Jojo (the youngest) is learning the fanatism of the nazi propaganda and his mother ( Scarlett J) tries to convince him there is still kidness in the world.
That idea sounded great, but then it gets mixed with other story plots and it seems like they wanted to be very funny and dramatic at the same time, and the main plot gets lost in it.
Still,its a great movie.
Hope you enjoy it."
JOJO RABBIT,5 August 2020,10/10,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a comedy in its purest form, laying bare the ridiculousness of war, the irrationality of bigotry, the paradoxical simplicity and depth of love. It is, above everything, a film that embraces hope as its highest virtue, as a tool against adversity and chaos."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"Everything about this movie from start to finish is perfect. The acting especially from first timer roman griffen davis, with one of the best child performances I've ever seen, and just the way taika balances all of these tragic things an turns them into a really funny but also hartworming film. Without a doubt my favorite movie of the year, thank you taika waititi"
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2021,9/10,"Brilliant, sweet, heavy. Surprising art house film. Deeply recommended."
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,7/10,"Having seen the trailer, I expeted more humor. It should have been beter in English. These are Americans trying English humor, but they just cannot do that rijgt. Rebel Wilson is super though. Her part should have been bigger. Scarlet is always great, found it odd she suddenly was gone though. It's a funny movie."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,9/10,"Clever writing, wonderful actors, amazing sets and every emotion gets a run. Don't read the story outlines. I was enchanted at TIFF and thrilled this movie has done so well. Ensemble shine together."
JOJO RABBIT,26 July 2020,10/10,"Just when I though that feature films were all formulaic uninspired panderings to the lowest level of expectation and interpretation, this came out. You must have a basic grasp of humor, including self deprecating, and appreciate that laughing at life -including both the ludicrous and the menacing - is one of the most effective methods to survive, move forward, and just frankly enjoy yourself. The best humor dances a fine line on the verge of "" too far"", and in this case it succeeded beyond anything I have seen to date. Wow. I laughed, I cried, and I laughed a whole bunch more. This really blew me away."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,10/10,"There's controversy for those looking for it. Many of the negative reviews I read, I feel, didn't watch the movie. Or, were expecting something else. However, the ending quote sums It up. Its an emotional rollercoaster of ups, downs, uncertainty, uncomfortableness, and clarity. The artistic elements create a surreal, dreamlike quality; reminding the viewer that it's about a child and his perception of the world. It shifts as he grows. There's many Story interpretations, which to me make it brilliant. Along with the theme of balancing tragedy with comedy, it's really a story of the unsung hero's of WWII, and life. The brave cunning rabbits that make it through the dark times and ultimately win."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,"Outstanding acting, casting, and screenplay. Poignant and laugh out loud funny while still showing the horrors of the Nazis. 100% recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,,"Waw just watched jo jo rabbit.absolutely stunning.everthing aboutit was perfection,so difficult to make a film like this without falling into sentamental smaltch ,butit managed it.the scene where jo jo follows the butterfly towards his dead mothers shoes, one of the most powerfull moments in cinema.the use of music was inspired.has togo down as the best film of 2019 for me"
JOJO RABBIT,15 May 2020,10/10,This is confirmation that Taika Waititi is a great writer and film director. It's more than I could have imagined it could be and beautiful made like his last few films. Time will confirm it's greatness.
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,"Wow. I was not prepared to be moved the way I was. I went into it thinking it was just going to be a satire that wouldn't get too serious, but I'm pleased at the direction the movie took. It left me sobbing. Very relevant content, even 75 years later. I think this is a film that can strike a chord in all of us, and should be watched by everyone."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is about a young German boy (Jojo) in the Hitler Youth that finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their house. This proves problematic for young Jojo who not only is an enthusiastic nazi but whose imaginary friend is Hitler...played by Taika Waititi.From the outset this film looked like it was going to hilarious but how would it go in striking that balance of not being offensive?I found that the film was quite well balanced with the right level of seriousness and humor. I was laughing at the often ridiculousness of images through most of the film until I got to that point in the film where I felt like I'd been slapped in the face when things took it's inevitable serious turn.That said Waititi doesn't have you in slumped in sadness for too long. That's not the point of this film but it did need it. There is hope and there are surprises from terrible situations.In terms of the cast, the whole ensemble was very complementary to each other and not a performance let the film down. A couple of standouts (while hard to narrow down) would be Sam Rockwell - he again gives another brilliant performance and Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo was also very impressive.Taika Waititi himself did a great job in what is a difficult role to take on and made me think of Mel Brooks' The Producers several times.Highly recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,10/10,"You need to watch this movie. Absolutely amazing. Best satire I've ever experienced, no question about it.I heard it was good, but I didn't expect to watch one of my favourite movies all time.Even from the first minutes I was hooked. The screenplay is magnificent, I was basically hypnotised.The cast also does a splendid job. Scarlet and Sam are awesome and little boy does a much better job than expected. Basically he carries most of the movie on his little shoulders (I assume he had a lot of help from the director, but this doesn't take anything away from his performance).Waititi was sensational, you can tell that this is a kind of movie that is make or broken by the director and he did close to perfect job as possible."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,9/10,"I've seen some reviews saying this movie makes light of the holocaust & also that people couldn't ""make it past 30 minutes"".. I was nervous when the beginning seemed to showcase an upbeat side to being a Nazi, but as the movie goes on, you'll find it's meant to be ironic.This movie certainly focuses on the heartbreak and struggle that happened during the holocaust as well as the absurd beliefs held by those participating as Nazis.Also, the casting and acting are incredible! A truly heartfelt, ironic, funny and interesting story about keeping your hope during trauma."
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,7/10,"It's like you just know when you're watching a movie, you know that the movie is great and you going through your mind to find the best scenes and everything also discovering some of them at the end."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,10/10,A proof that you don't need a $100 million+ budget to make an amazing film; All it takes is imagination and an amazing cast.
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2021,10/10,"Excellent film.
Tradgic comedy.
Dark humour but very funny.
David Bowie in German is one of the best humour moments.
Watch and enjoy.
Most people hates Nazi's , hopefully."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,10/10,"While not as agonisingly heart breaking as Life is Beautiful, I think Jojo Rabbit runs a stronger line of black comedy, that at any moment in my theatre had half the audience laughing, and the other half holding their breath.
All the performances were excellent, and I think this was Taika Waititi's best. While he mostly played the character of 10 year old Jojo's imaginary best friend (Hitler) for laughs, there were moments when he would channel the nascent violence from the real Fuhrer's newsreel speeches that were truly frightening.
Sam Rockwell plays it perfectly as always, in what I think was a nuanced portrayal of a man who could see the end coming.
I am a fan of Scarlett Johansson. She delivers here.
The story felt embedded in events, within a place, which I don't think I've felt with the Directors previous films.
While I haven't seen all the contenders, I really hope this takes Best Picture at the Oscars."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"Absolutely great film. JoJo rabbit manages to integrate a whole batch of genres. While starting off funny, it then progresses to more deeper and sorrowful parts. There are some scenes that hit you by surprise, making them feel even more emotional. The ending is bitter-sweet, with some sweet jokes cracked. One of the best and unique movies I've watched."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,10/10,"Alright jojo rabit is an incredible film. it's subtly hilarious at times, sad and very real and serious all at the same time.the way it treats themes and concepts such as anti-semitism, discrimination/racism in general, fascism and nationalism in a humorous way all while remaining very serious and reflective of such horrible things speaks lengths to the skill of taika waititi as a filmmaker.the acting is great and perfectly captures the tone of the script and film.his writing and humour is better than ever and holds up to his previous works, thor: ragnarok and hunt for the wilderpeople, which you should definitely watch if you like this.it's one of my new all time favourite films and waititi continues to hold his place as one of my favourite directors and one of the most original and creative today in my opinion."
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,7/10,"The movie was great but i think there is a lot of decisions doesn't make sense.
Last point i think they not deserve the best adapted screenplay , the Joker movie deserve it more than them."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,9/10,Its runs you through every emotion with this film. It's good to see films that are a far cry from cookie cutter variety.
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2020,8/10,"Awesome transitions from laughing to sadness.Jojo role has been played so well, loved it. Loved Jojo's character.Nothing bad to say, awesome comedy-drama."
JOJO RABBIT,15 September 2019,10/10,"Taika Waititi is a genius.
Don't hate this movie because it's on nazis.
Nazis are the worst thing that happend to humanity. But you can still laugh at them."
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,10/10,"What a great satire. This is one of the best movies i've seen in my life so far.
It's crazy, funny, heartwarming and eye opening at the same time.
It's a movie which fits so perfectly well even on todays happenings with it's message.
Taika Waititi and the whole cast did a great job here. Have to rate it 10/10 because this movie tries to send an important message and also delivers that in its own unique way."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,10/10,It is as beautiful and funny as it can be. You'll enjoy this movie. You're welcome
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2020,8/10,"Beautifully movie , makes you laugh and cry. Show the humanity at a time of war. The American flags at the end ... what the hell is that everyone knows the soviets took Berlin. I am European and it's sad how American propaganda machine is still ruining amazing movies."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,9/10,A funny movie where you can see Hitler get kicked in the nuts out of a window
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"Absolutely brilliant film! What an emotional ride of a movie! The actors were on point, the story is great and the cinematography was brilliant. I have reccomended this film to family and friends, once i got out of the movies. I definitely reccomend this movie to anyone that wants to watch a great movie! Cant wait to but the blu ray when it comes out!"
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,10/10,"Entertaining, stimulating, evocative, anti-war this unusual film engages from the start and never flags all the way. A terrific soundtrack combines with a splashy palette and excellent performances all round to ostracise the Third Reich, racism and the folly of war. It manages to mix flashes of humour with some very sad and strong war imagery and a tremendously realistic and movingly tragic snapshot of what the Fall of Berlin would have looked like.
Recommended!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 November 2020,10/10,This movie is one of my most favourite movies of all time. Taika Waititi (Adolf) Is really good in the movie and same with Roman Griffen Davis (Jojo).
JOJO RABBIT,29 August 2020,8/10,"Just... WOW. I know how much I say ""this movie made me laugh and cry"" and I usually don't really cry with movies but I DID cried with this movie. This movie can hit in an emotional level anyone, including adults and children, it's so well done that it transmitted the emotions as just few movies have achieved. This is probably the only movie in 2019 that made me tear up. There was one particular scene (I'm not going to explain the scene) that made me feel exactly the same as the character, I felt my heartbeat getting faster and a tear came out of my eye, and that only could have happened by two particular things: Taika Waitit's directon and Roman Griffin Davis superb acting.
I would like to point one thing in particular: the acting. Every character is loveable at it's own way (maybe except Rebel Wilson's character) you will love and remember every character (maybe including imaginary Adolf) Jojo, Elsa, Klenzendorf, Yorki and Rosie, and it's a shame that now kids can't be nominated to an Oscar, cause Roman Griffin Davis deserves it, ¡how did he didn't won a Golden Globe! (My respects to Taron Egerton though).
One thing I noticed is how the movie starts with so much color but that color slowly starts fading away. That plays with your emotions cause the brain relates bright colors with happiness and grey colors with sadness.
The whole movie feels fresh although it's based on the book ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunens, but the book is dark and quite disturbing (It's actually not much like the movie) but I think it sometimes relays a bit in a kid's innocence humor, although it's more realistic and funny than in other movies.
This movie is great and it shows the already showed potential from Taika Waititi in a whole new level. This movie is almost perfectly balanced, not too much comedy nor too much drama.
Okay, I'l just say this: Probably the best movie 2019 (now JOKER has competition).
I would 10/10 recommend this movie to anyone deciding to watch it. Thanks"
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,8/10,"Detailing some of the most horrendous periods of the twentieth-century might be complicated, especially when the setting is Germany during WWII. As earlier films have demonstrated, it occasionally required some violent shoots with explicit blood as Saving Private Ryan, hostile behaviour towards the Jude population to the point it could affect the audience sensibility as Schindler's List. Nevertheless, for some reason, Jojo Rabbit is an excellent example of how we can change the viewpoint of memorable events in history even in the darkest hours. Indeed, young spectators will understand, have fun and, more important, learn from past errors which affected millions of innocent souls.Jojo Rabbits exceeds the initial expectations you might have before you bought the ticket to the theatre. It serves as a portrayal of children indoctrination through society. The manner they normalise violence, racism towards Judes, blind subordination to the Fuhrer, and so forth. The sense of humour touches these themes, so correctly, it does not impact the audience aggressively. The film introduces rough, gentle and bold characters who are flawlessly performed by a spectacular cast.Honourably, 2019 was the year of Scarlet Johansson owing to her phenomenal roles in Avengers: Endgame, Marriage Story and her sweetest performance I have witnessed so far in Jojo Rabbit. Furthermore, the friendship of Roman Griffin (Jojo Betzler) and Archie Yates (Yorki) without being aware of what was going on during Nazi Germany is an absolute win. In spite of being children, they have demonstrated engaging chemistry and comradeship during the montage. The best part is that aside from the film, for example, at the red carpet of the UK, this twosome interacts as if they were long-time mates which makes their bonds grow even stronger.When it comes to comedy, there is always a compound of experience (actress Rebel Wilson from ""Pitch Perfect"" and Taika Waititi from ""Thor: Ragnarok"") cheering up the atmosphere alongside with refreshed sense of childlike humour provided by German youngsters. Amidst jokes, you can find hidden facts about the Hitlerjugend as it is the case of splitting boys (to military duties and heavy tasks) and girls (to the Bund Deutscher Mädel so that they specialise on how to become exemplary housewives and raise the next generation properly). Charming Rosie Betzler (Scarlet Johansson) is a verdict representation of the national resistance against Hitler. Despite the danger it represented, the personas fight for what each of them believes, this is another reason why I consider this film a chef-d'oeuvre. Don't miss the opportunity to watch it!(83/100)"
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,10/10,"I absolutely love this , I loved everything about it this"
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,10/10,It should have won best picture. An amazing movie and a surprise.
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,9/10,"Little brainwashed boy, future SS soldier and avid fan of Adolf Hitler
discovers humanity, humility.. and in his own little ten year old mind... Love.
Brilliant film. Instead of focusing on the evils of Nazism... it ridicules the
stupidity of it. The idiocy, the mind-numbing ignorance. The subject matter
was such that it made it difficult to actually laugh.. But the joke was on them anyway. Great film"
JOJO RABBIT,21 May 2020,8/10,"By far one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is heartfelt, hilarious, absurd, genuine, moving, ridiculous, honest. The characters are larger than life, and yet absolutely believable. I could go on, but really, the only thing I need to say is ""Watch this movie""."
JOJO RABBIT,23 March 2020,10/10,"I'm extremely critical of movies, and media, and well most things. It's hard for me to really sit down and gawk at movies. That's not to say I'm picky, though I am picky in what I enjoy, I do understand I don't have to love a movie for it to be wonderful. What I'm saying is I like objectivity, but I'm picky on what exactly will make it into my favorites.This movie easily out did so many of my other favorite movies, it wasn't even a contest in my mind. Jojo Rabbit will take you through every conceivable emotion, make you laugh and cry. Oh and you will cry. In fact it seems many people, including myself, were not prepared for the emotional sucker punch they throw your way. Taika Waititi is known for being extremely talented, and it seems he put everything he could into this film. Barring the cussing, and cruel (but tasteful, and sometimes honest) humor, I think most people can enjoy this movie. So if those two things absolutely throw you off, then maybe don't watch it.As for the rest of us, let's make it a point to watch this before we die."
JOJO RABBIT,12 April 2020,6/10,Beautiful colors and costumes. Weird idea that is surprisingly well executed and kept me engaged. Suitable for kids but quick enough for their parents. Kids might get scared or confused however by the concepts...
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,10/10,What a brilliant way to tackle such a difficult historical time. Love the performances especially the kids. It's so absurd it's brilliant. Heartbreaking and funny all at the same time.
JOJO RABBIT,9 July 2020,9/10,"Boy portrayed perfect innocence and gave message with just his comic and innocent ways.
Scarlett Johansson is the loving part of movie never connected to a character who is this good in giving message with few scenes .
Overall a loved the actors in their unique ways of telling the truth which prevailed then."
JOJO RABBIT,17 May 2020,8/10,"I haven't been so excited for a movie for a long time. # JojoRabbit # makes me laugh and cry. When I walked out of the cinema, my steps seemed to be dancing. My friends and I wanted to talk about two stories that I had just finished watching. As a result, we looked at each other and laughed and couldn't speak.I have also watched a lot of good movies this year, and there are definitely very, very good ones, but none of them can make me so excited.This story tells people so true, sinful justice, dark and bright, thorny flat, rounded corners, all of this, the whole world, there is no ""difference"", the former and the latter are one What is fusion is hateful and cute.It also says ""love"", the most is love. It vividly shows you the power of ""love""-love makes people maintain humanity in the desperate situation, love makes people taste sweet in the most tragic moment, and love makes people dance outside the blur of guns and flesh.JoJo's mother said that only free people dance.JoJo's mother said that one day, you will meet that special person-she will teach you love.Then love can teach you the cosmic galaxy and all things.""Find a lover, make him suffer. And trust without fear.""A mother who knows what love is, so that two naive souls will always stand on the side of ""beautiful"".Choice is also power, and she gave them the power to choose to ""become a person"".So in the end Jojo asked the Jewish girl, ""When you are free, what are you doing first thing?"" I knew the answer subconsciously, which was a step faster than the girl on the screen:Dance.Because only free people dance."
JOJO RABBIT,3 June 2020,9/10,"This movie blew me away at its ability to truly make me laugh and cry and feel wildly uncomfortable the whole time. It was an adorable tale of a young nazi realizing the the truth of the world. ScarJo was fantastic, one of her best roles yet!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 September 2020,8/10,"It's strange to say a feel-good movie can be made around a cast of Nazi's, but director Taika Waititi managed to do just that.For a brief moment it felt like Waititi was borrowing a bit out of the Wes Anderson playbook, but it managed to take hold with its own identity.Jojo Rabbit is not meant to be historically accurate, so history buffs be warned.What you are going to get is a pretty lighthearted satire that examines how dumb it is to hate on people with mythical projections to justify such hatred, and how Nazi's didn't have a clue why they're following what they followed beyond being a part of a club, and Nazi's literally were just a bunch of children that didn't really know what the cause was about.Overall I thought Jojo Rabbit was quite great. It might not be for everyone's preferences but it's worth a shot."

I know this makes no sense but this movie is too great everything in this is so perfect. Roman Griffin Davis is a great young actor and hopefully the future I'm exctied to see Silent Night. Taika did a fantastic job, I read the script, it's amazing. In my opinion Taika should've at least got a Oscar nomination for Best Director. Everyone in this kills his performance espacially Thomasin McKenzie, who is also a great talent for the future, I escpect some Oscar nominations in the future ;) but also Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, ARCHIE YATES xD, Rebel Wilson and on...I love this and in my opinion it's a masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,11 September 2020,9/10,Great acting and amazing writing. Funny and sad at one point.
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2021,10/10,"I loved this unique and quirky film, sad and funny. Smashing!"
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,9/10,"Would recommend. Although set in WWII, the satirical social commentary is no less valuable today.Sam Rockwell at his best. Scarlett also brilliant.Great ending.Made my heart sing."
JOJO RABBIT,23 June 2020,10/10,"It is funny and emotional.
So many feels.
Great actors!"
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2020,1/10,This funny Morbus Comitialis reflects nothing but the handicap of the evolution of those who watch.
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,2/10,"As an old Waititi fan, antinazi in the heart I have to say that I am more than disappointed. Not funny at all, nothing new, wannabe Wes Anderson, acting at its worst, specifically young actors. Shame, very bad movie."
JOJO RABBIT,23 July 2020,9/10,Laugh your ass off and shake your head at the same time. Great depiction of how humanity can lose its way. The characters are nothing short of amazing. Somewhat more satirical veesion of government indoctrination than shown in Swing Kids.
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"Congratulations to the reviewer from Slant Magazine, for missing the point more than any film journalist in history, which is quite an achievement.The bad reviews from some critics, it's like they wanted Schindler's List 2.This is a great film, full of laughs and poignant moments.I loved it."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,10/10,"Joy, grace, childhood feelings of unknown, fantasy, the feeling of being helpless and alone and in need of a friend, a parent, a mother, a father.Truly heart-soothing film with great contrast between peace/war, love/hate and in the end the need of all of us to live.Cried to this in two scenes. Have not cried (not to a film but in any occasion) for more than 2 decades. I personally thank the writer mr Waititi for this river of emotions. Sam Rockwell just blows you away in any part and Scarlet Johansson is excellent as always but everyone-everything in this film is magnificent.Thank you for it."
JOJO RABBIT,30 November 2019,10/10,"Funny, sad, pointed. Not too graphic but emotional."
JOJO RABBIT,12 November 2019,10/10,So original. Laugh out loud funny then crying in the ladies room after it ended. And the performances! Everyone was terrific but little Jojo and the defiant Elsa were perfect. Unforgettable!
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2020,9/10,"Great film, Laughed and cried all way through. Definitely worth a watch"
JOJO RABBIT,8 April 2020,5/10,"I don't think every movie about such severe topics needs to be an intense and serious drama, but Jojo Rabbit is as much of a great movie about Nazi Germany and Anti-Semitism as Driving Miss Daisy, The Blind Side or any other ""white guilt"" movie are great movies about racism. It's quite sad and says a lot about society that so many people are blinded by slapstick jokes and a charming cast. As a fan of Waititi's work so far, I was very disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,12 July 2020,1/10,"It's disturbing how this movie shows 2 children brainwashed to believe they are enemies. Repeating bizarre race superiority speachs. They get along, but without leaving this sad fear to their neighbours aside.And then there are children actively fighting, going to the front to NOT die, because the script would never allow it.You may say: ""People know the horrors of war, that profits rich and kills the poor innocent, this is not about that""But this is marketed for children, that don't know that and would start romanticizing with war.Over that, the fact that zionist jewish people is currently opressing people and killing children with the ironic and paper thin excuse of self defense.The most bizarre film of the decade, in a bad, disturbing and unknowingly way"
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2021,1/10,Sorry but from the start of the film the acting is unbelievable and not for one second did I believe I was watching a German. The accents are pathetic. I found the writing to be second class and not humorous. I find Taika's films to be hit or miss and this one is most definitely a miss. His best film is What We Do in the Shadows.
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2021,1/10,"Starts bad and doesn't improve. The actors can't fake a German accent to save their lives. I sadly wasn't close to laughing at any point. Taika's films are hit or miss and this is the epitome
of miss. It's not even the type of bad that's good. This almost puts me off seeing any further Taika's films as I just don't know what humour he has left. It's such repetitive childish humour. See What We Do in the Shadows instead."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2021,1/10,Its rare for me to not finish a film I've started even if I'm not enjoying it I would usually labour until the end but this was lacking humour (and at no point has me near laughter) and too contrived for me that I stopped it at the one hour mark and deleted the file. Regardless of how the final half would transpire nothing would save the impression caused by the disappointing first half or the accents which did not know what they were and resembled a finger painting of something indecipherable. Decidedly unfunny; Taika's worst film.
JOJO RABBIT,26 September 2020,10/10,Me and my 12 yr old son have watched it 5 times in the last 2 weeks and we just love it
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"A jewel. Nothing more to say.
We recommend this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,30 April 2020,10/10,"I saw the trailers and expected to leave the theatre laughing my ass off. Instead, I'm crying like a little baby.You HAVE to watch this movie. It paints the second world war from the perspective of a child, and even though it's EXTREMELY one sided you still get both perspectives.It paints the perspective of how these poor children were treated, on both sides. For once a movie that shows the ""true"" story instead of ""GERMANY BAD!!!!"""
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,10/10,"Never thought that I would ever witness a movie that portrays the horrors of the Nazi Germany era in a satirical way.
Kudos to Taika and team. This movie not only shows the horrors of that era but also includes moments of comic relief effortlessly.
Acting was awesome especially Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie and Scarlett Johansson. Other Supporting casts were amazing too.
Every scene, every shot in this movie is so meaningful. A good message towards the end was cherry on the cake.
Writer- Director Taika Waititi did a great job of adapting this beautiful novel called Caging Skies.
Taika's portrayal of Adolf Hitler was damn hilarious.
He makes sure that the movie puts a lasting impression on the viewers.
I am glad that he won an Oscar for this movie.
Go watch this spectacular movie."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,9/10,A movie which contains both laughter and heart breaking moment at the same time and is very unique. I would recommend you to keep some extra napkins with you when you are watching this movie.
JOJO RABBIT,25 June 2020,6/10,"It's original, I'll give it that. Gets an extra star for that alone. But as I sat watching it, I found myself asking: why? I guess it was the missing father that led Johannes to fixate on the der fuhrer. But why? Why was the mother hiding the Jewish girl? Why exactly was she executed, (and they didn't come for the girl)? Maybe I missed these things, and will come back to it."

JOJO RABBIT,8 December 2019,10/10,This movie was very near perfect. Amazingly weaving a story about nazi youth into a heartfelt and often funny satire. All the performances are great. I loved JoJo's 2nd best friend.
JOJO RABBIT,20 October 2020,7/10,The kid had to be the dumbest SOB on earth. Rest of the film was pretty good although bizarre AF.
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,"A must see movie! Super funny, as well a heartwarming - even though it takes place in WW2."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2021,7/10,Not superb but quite interesting is the condition in which we actually see the psychosynthesis of Nazism through the eyes of a child. i would like to see more moview of Taika Waititi.
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"I saw all Oscar best picture nominees and this is the only one that I wanted to applaud at the end. All the actors were exceptional and the coming of age in WWII German town was beautifully done. I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did, but there are somber moments, too. Just like life, especially during war. If you haven't seen it, you must!"
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,9/10,"I admire all the young cast but especially the ""Jojo"". You may watch the movie in order to understand to both perspectives of nazi war. The movie is heartwarming and at the same time it is groundbreaking. I have experianced and watched for the first time a movie which handles this subject from a verry different angle. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,27 June 2020,10/10,"The 2nd best movie in 2019 after Joker , incredible story , outstanding performance by all crew especially Roman , music is sensational. If you don't watch till now , you are missing a lot . A great movie"
JOJO RABBIT,21 March 2020,9/10,"A mix of comedy with real life situation handled in a very smart way. Grab your popcorn and enjoy it,"
JOJO RABBIT,18 March 2020,10/10,I would recommend this film to anyone who's got a heart. It's so beautiful and quick-witted throughout. Every performer in this is hilarious and the soundtrack is unique. Best comedy of the year!
JOJO RABBIT,16 August 2020,10/10,Really can't understand the controversy around this film. Went into it thinking it was just a comedy based on a sensitive topic but it's so much more than just satire. It's expertly written with an amazingly talented cast. It will make you laugh and cry. A must watch!
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,9/10,"This story is one of few told from the perspective of a child which makes the film really unique. The fact that it's a fanatic child struggling with nationalism, fanaticism, love and humanity while living in a dictatorship makes it especially interesting and thought provoking. Taika Waititi does an excellent job delivering this sad and heartwarming satire peppered with plenty of laughs. The cast nails it! This is a lovely offbeat film that certainly deserves its Oscar nominations and win. I would definitely recommend viewing."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,10/10,"...just that!!! Young Jojo is an apocalypse, really talented!! A great fasma of emotions during the film... I'm really surprised with the low metascore, the movie is a definate must-see!! Enjoy!!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 June 2020,10/10,"Bowie, on this film, at that time in the film??Absolutely shut me down and stopped me short.Stunning technicolour film which grabbed my heart strings.I hope the content doesn't happen again.Stunning story. Thankyou."
JOJO RABBIT,30 October 2019,10/10,"This movie is not for the easily offended. But if you stay strong and just watch it for what it is, it's probably the best movie of 2019. This move has all the feels that you want to feel during watching a film. All the actors and actress are absolutely amazing. This movie is just flat out a classic that will be discussed for ages simply for it's controversial aspect, and how they made this movie work in such a brilliant way in 2019. The score  has given this film is a crime. I highly recommend everyone go watch this film!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 November 2019,9/10,"JoJo Rabbit is Taika Waititi's (What We Do in the Shadows) latest film. It is a magnificent heartfelt drama/comedy. Set durning World War II, the story follows JoJo (Roman Griffin Davis) a ten year old boy who is being raised by his mother (Scarlett Johansson). His dream is to one day become a member of Hitler's personal guard. To help JoJo to fulfill his dream is his imaginary friend, Adolf ""as in Hitler""(Taika Waititi). JoJo is injured in a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, durning his first outing with the Hitler Youth.
Upon his recovery he finds his mother has hidden a teenage Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.
Every actor in this film is perfect in their roles. perfection. Young JoJo and his friend Yorkie (Archie Yates)
are both charming and believable. Sam Rockwell is great as always in the role of Captain Klenzendorf, leader of the ""Hitler Youth"" and Rebel Wilson is at her over the top best as Fraulein Rahm.
The story was thought provoking, heartbreaking and hilarious all at the same time. This was Taika at his best. Taking him back to his indie roots. Go check this out, you won't be disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,10/10,"This is an anti war movie like Dr. Strangelove. It's funny, sad, disturbing, and enlightening, and the acting is outstanding. Nice to see ScarJo playing a real woman and mom, and the kids were all great. Waititi is crazy and amazing!"
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2019,10/10,"The movie really brought out all kinds of emotion out of me. I was expecting only comedy but in the end, it was a well-rounded and wholesome movie. It sends a great message by using humour as a tool. Easily one of the best comedies (or even movies) I've ever seen."
JOJO RABBIT,12 March 2020,7/10,"A little bit ridiculous but it's deserve to watch
It's tell you no winner in war just who lost much."
JOJO RABBIT,27 August 2020,6/10,"This movie teaches bad lessons as it is really more like trying to indoctrinate and teach you that the Nazis behaviour was not a problem by promoting Hitler as a nice person. Would you laugh if the movie was about Stalin or Mussolini or Hirohito? I certainly hope not. This movie just is an excuse to teach you that antisemitism and the invasions of Czechoslovakia, Greece, France, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Austria, Norway, the Baltics and Denmark were okay, and that death camps were no big deal and the Hitler Youth was a fun time. Please be aware this movie's messages are all bad, as it glorifies living in a dictatorship."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,10/10,"JoJo Rabbit is not only one of the most unique film concepts of the year but also one of the best films of the year in general. Taika Waititi's amazing directing and script make this film its own and it wouldn't be the same without him. His comedic flare brightens an otherwise darkly conceptual portrayal of WWII. Roman Griffin Davis' performance as JoJo is easily one of the best performances of the year, making me laugh and cry. He brings the energy and charm to every scene, all the actors in fact have phenomenal chemistry with each other and deliver the zany comedy with perfection. The pacing is well executed and the tone is surprisingly strong for a comedy film about Nazis. This film also couldn't have come at a better time in this political climate, talking about what's right and wrong and what it means to be a human and what value each person can contribute and if that contribution is for better or for worse. The setting immerses you and brings you into Germany. This film is easily the Best of the Year and should win Best Picture at the Oscars; despite its inevitable failure on that spectrum. This film makes you feel and that's what counts..."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"I laughed but more than that I cried. This movie seriously plays with human emotions , feelings and mentality. Music, Screenplay, Dialogues , Cinematic Photography, Sets, Costumes and Acting especially by the lead actor played by Young kid is fantastic."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,10/10,Fantastic. Perfectly hilarious and moving. Complete gold.
JOJO RABBIT,25 November 2019,9/10,I can't recall a movie that portrays the whimsical and growing pains of being a child. It was a movie filled with laughter and tears but in a good way. Not in the pitiful and awful way that would be a terrible waste of time.
JOJO RABBIT,1 June 2020,8/10,"A quirky film that took me a lot longer than I was expecting to get into. Many great performances, with Sam Rockwell as usual being a huge standout, although it did pull me out of it just how unsuccessful a lot of the cast were at maintaining a German accent. This really hit home for me in the last 15 minutes, being an emotional and heart-filled adventure, which landed a lot better with me than a fair bit of the humor. Definitely one I'd watch again, if nothing more than the premise of Watiti playing an imaginary Hitler!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 August 2020,4/10,"It's a sweet and wonderful, funny and poignant HORROR movie. It's a movie where background is death, genocide, extermination, complacency, betrayal. The colors are not bright enough on black and red background, sorry. Watching it hurts, and it does not heal nearly enough. Stay away if you are sensitive kind."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,10/10,"Everybody should give this movie a Chance. I am actually not into tragic-movies, but I have not seen such an good movie for a long time. Go watch it by your self."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,10/10,"This movie achieved something awesome. It managed to fit so many emotions into one film, and did it perfectly. The sad moments really felt sad, and the funny moments were very genuine and funny, then the super tricked up moments did perfectly with making you say ""Oh my god, that's horrible!"". One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.I have nothing negative to say about this movie..."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,9/10,"I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie. There are no spoilers here. Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's a simple message, and it's completely spelled out for you, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.And completely ignore the critics. I don't want to speculate, but they must be terrible people who can find no joy in anything."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,Lots of laughing. Lots of crying. Beautiful film. Not super cinematic but not every movie has to be...VERY ENTERTAINING would watch again and again
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,9/10,An amazing movie. The best of the year so far. The movie is touchung and thought-provoking.
JOJO RABBIT,28 August 2021,10/10,Ik heb gelachen en gehuild. En gelachen. En gehuild. En gelachen en gehuild.
JOJO RABBIT,28 October 2020,10/10,This is a great film people give it bad reviews due to the fact there a bunch a soyboys this is a beautiful funny and sad film and i will recommend to anyone who will here me out
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,I love how this movie achieved to be funny about such a subject without leaving a bad taste and at the same time have such character depth and drama that it had me at the brink of crying. It also manages to show how war is never black and white and there are good and bad actions on both sides.
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,7/10,I think that the movie would be better and more emotional if it wasn't a parody and comedy. It's a good movie but not good as Boy in striped pajama for example. The movie is a little bit overrated so it doesn't diserve the rating it has.
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"A mixture of comedy, drama and sadness. Brilliant film"
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,9/10,I only saw this movie a few hours ago and thought meh I'll write a review so here goesThis movie was so close to perfect. The movie started and I was a little iffy with the comedy but it only took five minutes or so for me to get right into it. The Nazi and jew jokes are handled very well. Some of the jokes didn't always land like the scene where they are talking about kissing but apart from that nothing else. Only lots of tiny things really. The movie prevails in telling an emotionally rich comedy about anti hate and a kid whose imaginary friend is the one balled warlord. Overall a very good movie with rich comedy and a story that on the surface looks funny but is much deeper and better than anything I could've predicted. 9/10
JOJO RABBIT,6 November 2019,10/10,This movie is pure brilliant. the work is impeccable. go see it. you'll love it.
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,9/10,"I don't think being hilarious and serious are contradictory. This movie is actually talking about a serious topic although it tells the story in an easygoing way. I found a mix of real and extremely strong emotions in it, funny and sad. They are well expressed by the characters because they are so real. It is not always the case that people are either good or bad, they are just human beings."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is a film directed, written by, and starring Taika Waititi as an imaginary version of Hitler. It's an incredibly accessible indie comedy and I'd recommend it to pretty much everyone, Especially if you like movies like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The story has a lot of charm and kind of pokes fun at the blind fanaticism that the Nazis had for their country with many of the people in the film including our protagonist being excited to go to war. The film does an impeccable job of comparing this fanaticism to the true horrors of war with many characters being shown having severe injuries or even dying. Aside from the satirical aspect, the story is one of two people from different worlds getting to know one another, which is a timeless concept that can be applied to many different settings.The many technical aspects are done well. The editing is good, the cinematography is good, the music ranges from generic to German versions of iconic songs, the color grading is similar to that of many more serious WWII movies and that's all I really want to say without spoiling
I think one issue that I am a bit split on is the tone of the film. For the most part it stays pretty lighthearted but then all of a sudden it gets really dark quickly. However it still works well and is tonally sound but the sudden tonal whiplash is a bit jarring. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie too heavily though. Plot wise the movie was solid. It didn't really drag in too many places and it had a solid pace. All of the actors do an incredible job as well and help to bring the story to life."
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,8/10,"Funny but sensitive, well made, well acted and great musical score."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,7/10,"Bit different to the way it is portrayed in the ads, and after a shift in tone about 10 minutes in I found it predictable.Well acted, but could have done with more Sam Rockwell."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,8/10,"A movie that thinks it's funnier than it is, but still a funny movie, and carries an Oscar-worthy Sam Rockwell."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,10/10,"A moving, hilarious, thought-provoking movie that successfully navigates the difficult path that is a comedy rooted in difficult topics. Watching this with a full theatre, I could see that everyone else was following the same beats. From shock, to laughter, the movie had it all."
JOJO RABBIT,28 April 2021,9/10,"Not at all the movie I was expecting, but much better. Just watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,6/10,"At 10yrs old, Jojo is a proud member of the Hitler youth, but is unable to even kill a rabbit (hence the nickname). Surrounded by swastikas & hatred for Jews, what happens when he actually meets one? He compromises by conducting research on Jewry"
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,10/10,"Knowing Waititi and seeing the trailer, I expected this movie to be a comedy with some emotion. After seeing this movie, I saw comedy and emotion equally balanced, emotion even a little higher.The acting in this was CRAZY good. The chemistry between JoJo and Elsa was SO good. I believe this is the first time I've seen either actor in a film and boy did I love them! Yorkie was a great source of comic relief and I found myself smiling every time he appeared on screen. All these young actors were SO good! ScarJo and Rockwell were fantastic as well. Waititi's take on Hitler was hilarious and had me dying.My two favorite scenes was the one with the grenade and the one with the shoes. Great examples of balancing emotion and humor. Also as a history nerd, I thought this movie did a good job balancing the small scale war and the wider scale war too.Overall, this movie will make you laugh till you cry and cry cry for real. I loved this movie would 100% recommend it."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,10/10,"Very unique movie, and it was a funny approach for a movie revolving around events of World War II. This is definitely not something you'd see in other war movies. Some might not like it, however I happened to enjoy it quite a lot. It was a refreshing take on a matter as serious as World War II. Bravo!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,2/10,"I struggled to watch about 30 minutes of the movie, but it was just to dull to watch. The jokes that were supposed to be funny were so empty and the ""clumsiness"" into the characters' play was not helping either. The story was not following anything special and I felt that most of the time was meant to be covered with an unnecessary extension of boring moments."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,10/10,This movie is so hilarious but tragic at the same time! We enjoyed it and will see it again.
JOJO RABBIT,6 March 2020,,"Jo jo rabbit deals with some very difficult and not so easy to grasp subjects.
Yet the director handles it in such a tasteful and, brightly humorous manner..
From Jo Jo's encounter with a hidden Jewish girl to the desperate and seemingly hopeless search for his estranged father.Whilst some scenes may be shocking and difficult to understand for younger children
Jo jo rabbit helps us to see the absurdity of war
It also affords children the opportunity to delve further into history and see just what happened during the two world conflicts that affected this planet."
JOJO RABBIT,3 March 2020,9/10,"Man, I really loved this film. At first I felt guilty for laughing because it seemed pro-nazi until you realize what it is and then I was ""IN"". Didn't see the shoes coming. and the little heavy set kid was my favorite. Damn god movie."
JOJO RABBIT,17 March 2020,10/10,"I went to the cinema completely blind as to what this was about or where/when it was set so had no preconceptions when viewing. At first I'll admit I felt a little awkward laughing about what we all know is a dark, tragic situation but slowly I started to see the story as its supposed to be viewed, through the rose-tinted eyes of a young German boy. The story progresses beautifully as we see his character and view of his situation develop through the tail end of WW2. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson bringing a wildly different angle to Nazi portrayal. This to me was a masterclass of how to make a movie based on a story with such outrageous characters - especially 'Hitler' as a wacky/supportive/fun imaginary friend. This could have been a horribly offensive, mess of a movie but its not, its beautiful, its tragic and hilarious, most of all a must for any movie lover. You'll never have seen anything like it."
JOJO RABBIT,22 August 2020,10/10,"As a musician, I'm drawn to the music in a film, especially when it's well utilized. With all due respect, a movie can be well-written, -directed and -performed; but it simply cannot be as emotionally impactful without a deft musical soundtrack.I actually covered ""Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand"" back in the mid-70's, so that was a trip down memory lane. But, the real. deep emotional moment comes at the end of the movie with Bowie's ""Helden"". While some may dismiss the scene as mere fantasy, it's important to remember that within 15 years of the end of WWII, the Beatles were born in Liverpool, the British Invasion was on. Hendrix and Joplin brought awareness to social and wartime issues...In short, the end of WWII and the division of Germany into free Republican and oppressive Socialist states gave birth to modern Rock (and The Scorpions, thank you very much). And rock'n' roll won that conflict.That's my perspective, and from that perspective, the end of the movie is simply joyful and heart-rending: It is the future of the Western world summed up in one powerful image of two kids who should be enemies, dancing into a new dawn. Heroes, forever and ever. Philistines be damned!-zedP.S.
Had no idea Ramones tune was actually a cover of Tom Waits. I take back everything bad I ever said about the man (well, most of it)... but, only because -- accompanied by a pop heard round the world -- they finally put Journey in the hall, only 6 years after Waits. Puh-leeze!"
JOJO RABBIT,21 April 2020,10/10,"EXCELLENT movie...In a world where fascism is on the rise, the movie came out at the ideal moment."
JOJO RABBIT,7 June 2021,10/10,"This movie is so good ,i really enjoyed it so much , it's dark but funny 10/10."
JOJO RABBIT,10 July 2020,7/10,"The movie was very well done the way it depicted the mind of a young Nazi youth camp boy and how the Nazis propaganda has brainwashed the young boy
i think Rosie is by far the best character in this movie and Scarlett johanson gave the most emotionally heartwarming and heartbreaking performance.
over all i love the film and i highly recommend it"
JOJO RABBIT,19 April 2021,10/10,"A masterpiece which pokes fun at evil of nazis, yet has times where it just hits you in the chest with sorrow. It will make you laugh and it will make you hate the evil of Hitler's hatred for the Jews and anyone who aided them."
JOJO RABBIT,30 April 2021,10/10,You will never know when you will start crying after laughing. Wonderful movie! Loved the acting and movie plot.. must watch!
JOJO RABBIT,10 April 2021,10/10,"Emotional rollercoaster, but amazing all the same."
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2020,8/10,"I watched this hoping to see some Taika Waititi style comedy, and that's what I got. Bags of it.It's not trying to be some attempt at hard-hitting satire like some critics seem to have wanted it to be. He saw some innocent humour in the mind of a 10-year old child starting in the then compulsory Hitler Youth, and the juxtaposition of teachers having to appeal to 10-year olds while at the same time preparing them for the army and life in a tolatitarian regime. And he was right, it is funny.At the same time, the movie explores JoJo's realisation that the ideals of the world in which he lives in far from simple, by using the ""Mexican stalemate"" between him, his mother and her Jewish stowaway. This is where the movie is both charming and tragic, and again it works. There is no inappropriate comedy here. It is delivered in a sensitive manner that should lead to some awearness and questions from a younger audience.So what did I, a forty-year old bloke, get out of it apart from some situational comedy? Perhaps, some comfort in knowing others are aware that while life can throw terrifying circumstances your way, most will move on and there isn't a need to treat it like its fragile and sacred."
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2020,9/10,"Taking out all the creativity and beauty this is a hard story to bite into , very emotional but with the director that is at helm i had no doubt of its ...beauty to come , & it CERTAINLY DELIVERED a beautiful story and major props to all the main cast ... great skills guys."
JOJO RABBIT,16 June 2021,9/10,"A must watch. This film is so thought provoking and keeps you on the edge of your seat.I loved the satire, the humour and the heartbreaking elements all the same.Some would shun this film based on its topic but what better way to convey a time in history. I believe it did it justice.. Hats off to the Director."
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2021,9/10,It's a unique story that will make you cry and smile all the time. Warmed my heart
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2021,10/10,"It is quite a brilliant piece of art, I don't want to spoil it with excessive words.
I just let you know that it will definitely amaze you with its colorful moments hidden in a whole grey picture."
JOJO RABBIT,18 August 2021,3/10,"When the movie was out, everyone talked about it. People told me to watch it because the movie was funny, heartwarming, mind-blowing, and worth watching.The story was full of stupidity, it was not humorous. HeartwOrming and mind-off-putting. What's the moral of the story? None.Just because people praise and love a movie, doesn't mean it is a good movie. It only shows that people like different genres or movie types. Or...I just have a better taste :DI wanted to give 1 star, but Sam Rockwell played brilliantly, so I gave 3 stars. You saved the movie from a total disaster, Mr. Rockwell!"
JOJO RABBIT,12 March 2021,9/10,"Taika Waititi's most daring film isn't his most successful. But among the tonal clashes there's real hope, humanity, and no-bones-about-it Nazi-bashing at a time when that's depressingly necessary. Jojo Rabbit isn't simply an anti-hate movie as the ads say. More importantly, it's a pro-love movie."
JOJO RABBIT,21 August 2021,2/10,I got mislead by good reviews but the film wasn't even worth my time whatsoever. The comedy in this film is just stupid and bad.
JOJO RABBIT,3 June 2021,9/10,"This gem of a movie reminds me of the classic movie To Kill a Mockingbird. Just as Mockingbird portrays the evils of racism through the unjudging eyes of six year old Scout, Jojo Rabbit portrays the Hitler Youth through the eyes of an innocent 10 year old who sees the Nazis as a club that holds summer camps and teaches the children the ""skills"" they need to serve Hitler -- the boys to become Aryan warriors and the girls to breed a new generation of Aryans. There is a lot of humor, but the film is far from a ""satire""; there are some apparent exaggerations (such as, the age at which the Youth were put into the real army, but the indoctrination of the Hitler Youth to become mindless fanatics is all too accurate, as accounts of American soldiers who faced the Hitler Youth near the end of the world attest. Scarlett Johansen deservedly got an Oscars nomination for her portrayal of Jojo's anti-Nazi mother, and Sam Rockwell is well cast as the German officer assigned to the Hitler Youth office. But the performance by Thomasin McKenzie as the teenage Jewish girl hiding in the wall of Jojo's dead sister's bedroom is even more exceptional. Her subtle and natural facial expressions are masterful, and her exchanges with Jojo about the false portrayal of the Jews are the heart of the film."
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,9/10,"From Thor Ragnarok to Jojo Rabbit - What a contrast from Taika Waititi. Every main casting in the movie is so well crafted. Jojo, Rosie,Captain Klenzendorf clearly standout among them. Simply loved Yorki and the satire that comes out. Of-course Taika Waititi himself doing the Adolf. Hail Hitler.....:). Germany at the brink of world war 2 defeat - beautifully crafted from a eyes of 10 year old boy.
Jojo Rabbit - Hilarious, Satire and Humanity....."
JOJO RABBIT,22 October 2020,10/10,What can I say about this movie that has not already said. The performances across the board are outstanding. Beautiful cinematography. I can't remember seeing a comedy that made me cry so much. I can't remember a drama that made me laugh so much. This movie is both.
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2020,1/10,"This was absolute garbage to be honest. Not funny, not satire, not entertaining and not interesting.
Can't believe I bought this digitally as it looked like it was going to be great.
What a disappointment."
JOJO RABBIT,24 September 2021,9/10,Movie has everything.. A caring mom.. A lady who understand war is not the real site.. A kid who do anything for being Nazi and the same kid who thinks we win after the loss of Nazi.. For me the Captain K role is the best in movie..
JOJO RABBIT,2 March 2020,6/10,"Jojo is a 10 years old boy fanatic nazi, who's best friend is Adolf Hitler himself. That says a movie description and Jojo's mother. But we didn't see it at all. Jojo is just a kid, who likes swastikas and the idea of being nazi, but he never feels like one. You never ""buy"" it, because Jojo is so cute and fails in his first ""mission"" to kill a rabbit. In fact, all the Deutsches Jungvolk looks more like a scouts to me (maybe because of English language and american maniers). And because of it, we never feel a real fear and atrocities of Nazi ideology and war itself. Maybe the movie's idea was to show us that kids were just a kids even in Nazi Germany, I don't know, but I think the movie would be better if it's tone were more serious.Should we use homour anyway? The themes like WW2 and the Holocaust are extremly serious. The humour could be used to show it's absurdity and insanity. The parody, sarcasm and irony are good tools to show it. But it's very difficult because the topic is so sensitive. Probably the best example of movie that succeed in it is R. Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"". Also I would recommend to read amazing book ""The Forest of the Gods"" by Lithuanian author Balys Sruoga."
JOJO RABBIT,3 July 2020,8/10,"This will attempt to be a spoiler free review.This movie puts forth a powerful moving message, and resonates somewhat with current events. It is quite silly here and there, excusable as it is mostly from the eyes and mind of a young child, but other times it's not as easy to accept.Personally I feel some of the silliness was misplaced, but this didn't happen that often. I think the film would have been far more powerful with a few tweaks, but if you can see past some of these ""over the top"" moments the overall message is very moving. Quite a bit of the silliness is due to the child's perspective and conspiracy minded individuals, so those parts are acceptable.The acting, other than what is mentioned above is superb. I will remember this movie and it's message for quite some time.I recommend you ignore the critics and give this one a watch."
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2020,10/10,"I had no idea what to expect but I like Taika's work. If you're looking for a comedy, you're not going to find it here. There are funny moments but this film is a drama. It's relies solely on the individual performance of a few actors and character development. We don't need another film to relitigate that Nazism is evil or that the holocaust is stain on human history. Those are accepted facts. This film tells the story of people ""doing what they can"". It made me feel empathize with imaginary characters. It reminded me that no amount of hate will ever make things better."
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2020,3/10,"Ironically the only really bad and by all standards unacceptable deed in the script is not what the nazis do, but ... the Russians shooting prisoners of war. A huge blunder that goes against any other message this film is trying to convey"
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,9/10,"I saw a couple of weeks the trailer , a lot of meme online ,a lot of noise but seemed a waste of time , now i regret not seeing it early. :)"
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,1/10,"This is my 1st review in 10 years. It is probably the worse movie to be nominated on oscars.this is unacceptable ,worst movie seen in decades"
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,8/10,"Are movie critics really people that matter? I don't recall ever having cared about what some self-proclaimed know it all thinks about a movie. Generally speaking user scores are more interesting.Anyway, the movie itself, I thought it was both funny and cute. Had it's heart in the right place. If you want to laugh and maybe cry a little bit, you might find yourself happy to have decide to see this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,27 March 2021,9/10,"I haven't felt the need to write a movie review in a while but I will for this movie especially since I've seen some reviews here that are quite negative mildly put. I understand the subject might offend a lot of people and in these 'politically correct' times we live in, this movie might be viewed as 'pushing it'. But if there is someone that can take such a grim - and for some controversial time in man's history- and turn it into a 'just right' satire that brings out all sort of emotions- is Taika Waititi. It just captures the human condition with all its faults with a twist of comedy and bravo for that. Definitely give this masterpiece a shot! 9/10 from me."
JOJO RABBIT,9 June 2020,10/10,"I close my eyes when a trailer comes on for a movie I might want to see -- to prevent spotting each slice of the trailer while experiencing the whole show. But JoJo Rabbit wasn't an automatic sell, so I watched. I saw an exaggerated, zany attempt at turning fascism into comedy. I cringed. Why would I want to normalize Nazis with laughter? I avoided the theatrical run and for months after, refused to stream it. Finally, Trump and the antifa movement, together with a viewing of two versions of The Diary of Anne Frank, made an experimental viewing hard to resist.JoJo Rabbit was a massive surprise, a sensitive (funny) masterpiece. Fascism and its parody is only the context -- the text is the coming of age of a wonderful 10-year-old character. The emotions and dilemmas are complex in the midst of sharp wit and perfect timing. But the trailer is dead wrong and may be blocking others from seeing this incredible work. If you were turned off by the trailer, give the movie a try before you judge. The book is much, much better than the cover."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,8/10,This movie has everything drama emotion n fun. Loved it
JOJO RABBIT,4 November 2019,10/10,I honestly did not enjoy Thor: Ragnarok by the same director so I was skeptical of this at first if I would enjoy the humor or not. It eneded up landing on my list of favorites of the year if not THE best so far!The film does so well at having dramatic and emotional moments in the midst of a satirical portrayal of Nazi Germany. The themes and motifs are strong and enduring.I also enjoyed the use of some contemporary music as well. The movie ends so perfectly. This is storytelling at its finest folks.The only crime here is that I judged Taikia from only one one of his films. Sorry mate!
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,10/10,"This movie made you laugh, made you cry and show the real aspects of war, the brutality, the madness, the heroism, sacrifice...
From my point of you it was perfect!
I have not seen a movie like this for ages!
In Taika Waititi we trust!"
JOJO RABBIT,13 December 2020,9/10,"Despite the surplus of hit-or-miss Nazi portrayals in recent years, Jojo Rabbit's ability to shine brighter has little to do with its depiction of accurate history and everything to do with Taika Waititi's talent for communicating story and character alike in such a genuine manner; it allows for humor and heart-rending pathos to share screen-time without seeming awkward. Scarlett Johansson's ""Rosie"" in particular pulls so many varied emotional responses from what is essentially a supporting role. It just works, beautifully, this film is an absolute gem!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,"I expected to enjoy this movie and I was not disappointed. I did not expect the full range of emotions it brought out. Beautifully made, beautifully performed. Absolutely love. I don't understand the naysayers."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,8/10,"Ignore the critics. This movie is not offensive or slight. I laughed and I cried at this, the story is endearing, wacky in places and ultimately moving. The cast is excellent, even Rebel Wilson's and Stephen Merchant's particular and unique comedy styles being well utilised. Go see this movie if you want something bold, different but also with a heart."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,10/10,It's easy to make people laugh. It's easy to make people cry. It's easy to make people feel suspense. It's easy to make someone hate a character it's easy to make someone love a character .. but to do all these things simultaneously and ask questions of the viewer while doing so..it deserves more than being labeled a controversial satirical comedy..
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,8/10,Powerful and strong enough to knock everyone out. It made me laugh and cry at the same time and the acting is outstanding. This movie is one of a kind. Go watch it.
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,"Wow what an amazing film!! Just watch this film and judge for yourselves, it's an emotional rollercoaster of a film. Taika Waititi the man who made the Thor saga great, hands down a great director."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,10/10,Everyone should see this movie. It makes you feel every possible emotion.
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,8/10,"Funny, engaging, tear-jerking, sweet and silly. The adults clearly relish their roles; Taika revels in his ridiculousness as imaginary Hitler and Sam Rockwell is as joyous to watch as ever. The youngsters are natural and appealing, despite (or maybe because of) some inconsistent accents. Thomasin McKenzie and Roman Griffin Davis bring real emotional weight to the whole thing. The absurdity of the adult characters serves to intensify the sucker punches of the tragic elements for the children. Important, as all Nazi stories are, but quirky, refreshing and very enjoyable."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,8/10,"This movie is worst as the worst commercial!
Do not spend your time!
Watch something else..."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,10/10,I was speechless initially leaving the theatre because I didn't know where to start- I LOVED all of it! It was hilarious and full of heart. I think they did an excellent job transitioning from the funny moments to seriously dark. They didn't put in a punchy joke to lighten the mood back up. The levity or seriousness flowed with the story much better than other films. Loved every second and the two lead boys were SO FREAKIN PERFECT!
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,9/10,"This is a beautifully crafted film that is so multi-dimensional it is difficult to critique. First, We were taken with the superb acting, especially that of Roman Giffen Davis, who captures the complexities of a 10-year old in transition under emotional . pressures. We were appreciative of the nuanced humor to reveal a most difficult story of evil and redemption: Then, we grew to appreciate the artful use of the imaginary friend to demonstrate the shifting emotions. We were also quite taken with the film's facing tragedy in a frank, yet sensitive way. All in all, we were entertained, enlightened and uplifted. A tall order, nicely accomplished."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,9/10,"I don't know what to say but here I am writing this. It was an incredible movie. Experienced joy and sadness at the same time. Laughed a lot and almost cried on few scenes. What an amazing writing and acting. I swear, Taika Waititi's style is amazing! I have no words... The best movie of 2019 without a doubt.
I wish I had watched this on big screen."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,9/10,Such a refreshing movie - I have never seen a Taika Waititi movie before but I will definitely be checking out his back catalogue after this. At first I was a little bothered by the characters not speaking in correct German accents but soon realised it didn't matter as the story just draws you in and is quite amusing. All the actors/actresses were great - even Rebel Wilson who I am not a big fan of. I really thought that the first half of the film reminded me of a Wes Anderson film because of its quirkiness but then it developed a style of its own. Taika as Hitler was the perfect choice and achieved a great balance - both funny and serious at the same time but not too horrible (considering it's Hitler he is portraying). Thomason is brilliant as the Jewish girl and Scarlett Johannsen is always good. Roman was brilliant and I look forward to seeing what he does next. This was a really enjoyable film and felt fresh and new. I particularly enjoyed the modern music in parts. I am now a convert to the films of Taika Waititi.
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,10/10,"Ignore the reviews saying there shouldn't be comedic World war II films, it can be done right, and Taika Waititi did it perfectly.
Sensitive, funny at the right times, serious when need be, perfectly directed.
It is dry comedy similar to Wes Anderson and a lot of British TV, so go in with an open mind, don't force expectations and you will have a wonderful experience."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,10/10,"I've never seen a film quite like this. Incredibly moving yet hilarious. The acting is amazing, the cinematography is great, the story is captivating and emotional and the characters are lovable.
Seriously, you MUST see this film."
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2020,10/10,"Look I'm not gonna claim any movie is perfect. But I would be hard press to find a movie that manages to tackle as many different themes as this film and be able to handle them all well.I defy you to find a movie with more likeable characters. Amazingly you can comfortably root for every meaningful character while still having a ""villain"" / evil force to root against. Even as that evolves during the film. Even Hitler is a fun aside as the movie balances levity with the dark environment it operates in.The reason movie scores so high in my mind is because it executes every level as well as you van expect, and then some. From writing to set design to simply the casting involved, this movie is worth every penny"
JOJO RABBIT,17 April 2020,9/10,"For an anti-war movie, I cannot imagine a more colorful frames as well as the story, could get!
Incredible acting from all of the cast while telling such a tragic history, was never so much fun to watch."
JOJO RABBIT,25 October 2019,,"Saw it at a film festival. This movie is a Disneyificaction of WW2. This sick movie makes some of history's worst characters seem no worse than the bad guys in Disney movies. The story tries to make the Gestapo as funny and cute bumblers. There is nothing comical about the Hitler Youth or old men dying in Germany's last stand. Almost everybody I knew who went through WW2 is gone, and it was the worst experience of their lives and worst human episode in modern times. This movie is outright offensive."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi you beauty, from What we do in shadows to Thor ragnarock to This, you become something I can just imagine. Roman, Scarlett, Thomasin, Sam Rockwell, ""Yorkie"", and Rebel what a cast, what a performers. Just cant wait for Thor : Love and thunder now....hands down the best movie of 2019 no debate."
JOJO RABBIT,7 June 2020,9/10,"I laughed quite a lot during this lovely film which cleverly satirises the pomposity and cruelty of the Nazi creed while at the same time warning us how young minds can be poisoned. We see Nazis and Jews through the eyes of a member of the Hitler Youth, who has Hitler as an imaginary friend, until he finds a real friend in the older (Jewish) girl his mother is hiding behind a wall. The young lead is brilliant, as is director Taika Waititi in the role of Hitler."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,10/10,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this, But they managed to get the humour perfect as well as giving us a nice story coming from nativity of child living in Nazi Germany. Some good performances and nice aesthetics throughout make the movie and very enjoyable watch"
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2020,9/10,"A movie that was really funny, but also so incredible sad. I felt it was put into context brilliantly that while some characters were not evil they were caught in evil propaganda. Also all the characters were subtle and brilliantly done.
Please watch it we need more movies like this.
I almost want to give it higher than 9, but i beleive 9 is a fair rating."
JOJO RABBIT,3 August 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi wrote an incredible story! A new perspective of WW2. You are gonna laugh and cry and laugh again. The costumes, the music, the jokes, the storyline and so much more..."
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2020,10/10,"From the first few scenes I knew this film would be different but it was beyond my expectation.
The acting was amazingly endearing throughout and the story was great.
A 9/10 film but what made it a ten for me was that it's a film like no other. I can imagine so many directors/writers/producers wishing they'd come up with the whole package.
A must watch!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 July 2021,1/10,"Disgusted DISNEY , i find to revive the Swasticker is offensive."
JOJO RABBIT,5 March 2020,9/10,"This is a brilliant, funny and emotional movie that's sometimes tongue-in-cheek, and sometimes not.For me the most outstanding performance was from scarlett johansson who has finally started to fulfil her capabilities. She was mesmerising.Gilby Griffin Davis looks like a future Oscar winner.Go watch."
JOJO RABBIT,26 July 2020,10/10,"Understand the subject your learning is super hard to take in... so mixing in humor allows it to sick in and help you digest the tragedy of it all. If you don't watch a single ad for the movie YOURE DOING YOURSELF JUSTICE. I didn't see where it was going - being Ashkenazi Jew - I was worried about the glorification of nazis but that's all internet stupidity.
The ending quote is perfect. This film is a must watch comedy-tragedy-heartfelt masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,9/10,"Great satire from a director who is increasingly showing a great technique at storytelling. The two young leads excel and the support from Johansson, Wilson, Rockwell and Waititi himself just wrap the entire thing in a neat little bow. Funny, thought provoking and sad. Ignore all the negative reviews and see it for yourself. You wont be disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,9 June 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies of 2019. If you're already familiar with other movies by Taika Waititi, especially Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Boy, you know what to expect: amazing humour, touching moments, a little bit of drama and a lot of charm. All the characters (and actors, obviously) were simply amazing, though my favourite were Jojo (the kid is amazing), Captain K (he was the perfect example of a tired German soldier who didn't believe in nazism; I also loved his story arc and the way he always seemed to help Jojo), and imaginary Adolf Hitler (as much as it pains me to write Hitler and the word ''favourite'' in the same sentence, Taika was amazing and sooo goofy), though my absolute favourite was Yorkie, he simply stole every scene he was in.
I also loved that the story was told through the eyes of little Jojo, we were able to see how the Nazi propaganda poisoned the youth. I am aware of the fact that some people may think the movie was not appropriate, however, I think the Nazi satire is exactly what we need, and it definitely showed how ridiculous the Nazi ideas were.
All in all, I would definitely recommend getting and watching this movie ASAP, it is really amazing and perfect and everything I needed. I would also recommend watching The Great Dictator (Charlie Chaplin, 1940) and Life is Beautiful (Roberto Benigni, 1997), the former being funnier and an absolute delight, and the letter being more of a drama, with a little bit of comedy."
JOJO RABBIT,24 February 2020,9/10,"This is a difficult subject matter to watch and take enjoyment from, the fact that the director and cast have produced a film that you can enjoy but is still hugely thought provoking is a measure of their talent.Well worth seeing"
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"It was like seeing myself and my son.I only write reviews for movies that to me are perfect and completly move me.
This is the second one.It's a perfect mix of wit, sarcasm, kindness, laughter and reality... but SO much more and anything I say is an understatement.He is a genius."
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,1/10,"I tried so many times to watch this, given the director's track record
utter garbage - unfunny
if you want to see this done right - watch The Producers"
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,9/10,"If you believe the old saying that comedy is tragedy plus time, then you can get the first part of the movie. The comedy only lasts for so long and it is not a rollicking romp poking fun at the Hitler Youth throughout. It is an exploration in how easily manipulated, molded, scarred and indoctrinated youth are and the preciousness of life. We are all one race and those that try to divide us with looney tune notions need to be laughed at. The youth look at us for their cues. We hate; they hate. We love; they love. Let us teach children love and acceptance. Obviously Hitler was unredeemably evil. This movie takes Hitler and Nazis and removes the power of the image and makes him and Nazi notions the clownish nonsense they are and that should be laughed at. (Yes millions were killed in factories of death but this is not that movie - It tries to make you laugh at them instead of being overwhelmed by their power and savagery and trail of countless bodies). If you are an adult and look fondly to the Third Reich, you need serious help and deprogramming."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,10/10,"Loved it, well done movie. ....Best of the year so far"
JOJO RABBIT,14 November 2020,4/10,Was really looking forward to this but was actually a bit disappointed. Was geared up to watch a comedy and it started out well but then just went downhill. Feel like it needed to pick a theme. A bit disappointed
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,10/10,"Coming from German heritage, the first 10 minutes of this movie made me squirm uncomfortably as I looked around the theatre too see whether Nazi humour/satire was now OK. The opening shots also showed the fanatic crowds from Hitlers rally's which left the viewer in no doubts about the sway the National Socialists had over much of the German public. In this context, the film displayed the comic genius of the director, as well as the most moving acting by the main child actors and Jo Jos mother beautifully played by Scarlet Johannson. Hilarious and moving. You won't be disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,3/10,"If it's supposed to be a comedy, I didn't laugh once. I found a lot of the humour inane.
I think the younger generations will find this funny as they have had less experience of learning about WW2 at school etc. so will not be so aware of the atrocities that took place, that they are now finding so entertaining in the film.
I found most of the film distasteful although I will admit that some of the more serious parts were quite well acted.
Overall I was disappointed that such a light hearted film could be made from such a serious topic."
JOJO RABBIT,5 July 2020,1/10,"I loved it till the girl in the crawlspace appeared, after that I could see the direction this film was gonna take. The comedy was superb, the story sucked. All WW2 movies are biased and this was no exception"
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is what a film should be. It triggered a whole range of emotions, thanks to an incredibly creative script, superb performances from every actor, and incredible authenticity of the sets and costumes. One of the top five movies I've seen."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,10/10,"Blend of tyranny overcome by love and conviction. This story resembles the past but can be adapted by the present and future. Jojo Rabbit gives us a satirical version of some purity in friendship and true love, hindered by assimilation but broken apart by understanding and kindness. Hate can be overcome freedom is a right and love is our connection.A masterpiece!"
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2019,9/10,"One of the best movies of the year. Everything is perfect. Actors, script, director's work.And yes it's not a comedy."
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,3/10,"Considering it's meant to be a comedy, Jojo Rabbit lacks enough jokes to sustain the entertainment for nearly two hours. Perhaps that's just a sign of these dreary repressive age we are living in, where jokes are considered so potentially offensive, that writers fear to employ them. They did invoke irony though, for example the film opens with a Beatles song then later there is a scene reminiscent of one of those Beatles bonfires they would hold twenty years later in the Great Satan. And then Adolf didn't have strikingly blue eyes, whereas Elsa did. This was about as amusing as SNL, but unlike SNL it was ""so white"". I didn't notice any GIs of color or oriental Soviets and who is mandating stormtroopers and Gestapo officers have to be played by white men? If you really want to watch humorous drama with an Aotearoan touch, you'd be better off watching the Brokenwood Mysteries."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,1/10,"This movie is nothing more than a war propaganda. The script shouldnt even be considered for production and i think that movies like this shouldnt be allowed in theaters for spreading disinformation, propaganda and false belief!"
JOJO RABBIT,3 March 2020,9/10,This movie revealed the exact picture of the instances during the Hitlers era. The movie is a complete satire of the incidents in hitlers era. The boys born are swallowed by the thoughts of nazisam. The various life styles picked up by the jews those days are portrayed. It shows the emotions of the jews.
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,9/10,"This movie made my heart melt and made burst into laughter at the same time...this movie will be a timeless classic, there is no way in hell that any other movie wins best picture for 2019. Taika Waititi has proven himself once again as one of the most unique directors of our time with this distinct vision of his."
JOJO RABBIT,7 March 2020,8/10,"And Jojo Rabbit left me feeling a bizzare mixture of feelings. Which leads me to thinking deeply about Waititi's intent - more importantly Christine Leunens's intent. To me, this signals a great film.
Some fantastic comedy, a rich and authentic setting, characters that feel at home in their roles, watch it and enjoy the ride!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"My personal best movie of 2019. Taika Waititi some how managed to make a comedy/drama movie about such sensitive subject, in 2019, midst all the cancel/woke culture pitchforks, yet somehow delivers a brilliant heart-felt movie, that is quite entertaining at the some time, it is just that good. Acting was superb from everybody involved but especially Roman Griffin Davis & Thomasin McKenzie who carry the movie on their shoulders for 80% of the run time. But this is a directer-movie, the artistic choices that Waititi makes really delvers quite gut-punch in a good way, This was the only original movie that I saw in 2019, in the sense that there isn't really anything like out there, its a movie that stays with you after it ends challenges your inner thoughts, and for me it was the only movie of 2019, that gave the urge to watch it again after it ended (10/10)."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2021,3/10,"It's not the fact that there's no historical correctness, nor that it's filled with unfunny jokes but how can someone even think this movie has something new, fresh or different to offer than any mediocre cliche filled flick about good and bad.
I really do not see what's it is that makes people not hate or even like this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,26 November 2020,10/10,"One of the best- delicately handling a dark period in human history with touching, humorous and sincere characters and excellent story line. Definitely not your average production- causes you to have multiple simultaneous emotions! Well done!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,"A film that explores the troubles and issues of WWII through the, often humorous and entertaining, eyes of a ten year old member of the Hitler Youth movement.Stunning performances from all actors involved. The relevance of the humour was excellent, and this complemented the serious messages of acceptance and looking for belonging, brilliantly. The naivety of JoJo was very well portrayed and important messages could be taken regarding acceptance of others and the dangers of propaganda and misinformation. Some twists and turns throughout the film keep the viewer engrossed and this complements the on screen relationships excellently."
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,10/10,"Taika Waitit has done something unique and significant with Jojo Rabbit.The casting, writing, photography, screenplay, direction, music, atmosphere and any other criteria you judge important were all taken close watch.10/10.A magnificent film in every aspect.I look forward to rewatching Jojo regularly."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,9/10,"After thoroughly improving in the MCU and resurrecting the character of Thor in Ragnarok (2017) he returns to his humbler roots outside of the superhero conglomerate. While it may not be as strong a film as Hunt for the Wilderpeople or indeed Thor Ragnarok , he still produces an astonishing piece of work that merges a witty and silly comedy Which Waititi is a master of with a truly devastating portrayal of youth and German society during the Second World War. It might not be as good as his other works, yet it it is still a strong and engaging film that is more than worthy of its six Oscar nominations and places its director right at the top of the league of film makers currently working now !"
JOJO RABBIT,11 December 2020,1/10,"This film is an atrocity mocking and belittling the abhorrent of the actions of the Nationalist regime during Hitlers time in power. At no point is this right or justified. As a German, I find it wrong and completely inappropriate for some Kiwi dumb dumb to make a movie about a German war criminal, with a complete disregard for what he did. Though I am not sensoring comedic license. It's not right to create a story in which from my perspective glorifies Hitler in a way that is simply wrong!If you want a comedic take on Hitler, check out Look Who's Back!"
JOJO RABBIT,14 November 2019,10/10,"Was so excited for a new Taika Waititi movie and this did not disappoint! As excited as I am for him with all the big things he's been doing (Marvel, the Mandelorian) I really hope he never stops doing his personal projects. They're just so good!"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,8/10,"I thought it was a cute, little film. It had some funny jokes, good acting, and was well written. It's not the greatest, however. The ending wasn't anything spectacular, but not bad either. I would definitely recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is amazing. I loved it, it has some problems but overall it's just great. I especially loved the script and the filmography."
JOJO RABBIT,21 October 2020,10/10,"An anti-Nazi war comedy sounds absurd, but Taika Waititi created a legendary film. A striking mix of genres, his signature style and great acting, this is how the magic of cinema is created. Indeed, this is the most anti-Nazi film that I have seen. Moreover, this is not a difficult drama, although there are moments that touch to the core.
This is a comedy about young Johannes, who, due to his age, is subject to the propaganda of that time. And his mother, played by Scarlett Johansson, on the contrary advocates the liberation of Germany from the Nazis. She rescues a Jewish girl Elsa by hiding her on the top floor of her house, in her dead daughter's room. Johannes is at first shocked that a Jewish woman lives in his house, but soon realizes that she will not go anywhere. This clash of worlds in the mind of little Johannes raises a number of questions and his black and white world will soon collapse. He stops thinking in stereotypes about Jews and even falls in love with Elsa.
There are no frankly evil characters in this tape, if we exclude the context, even Captain Klenzendorf, played by Sam Rockwell, at first does not betray a Jewess, and later saves Johannes himself.
Let everyone make their own opinion after watching, but mine is this light film that tells a truly difficult story."
JOJO RABBIT,6 December 2019,10/10,"Taika Waititi is best known for Thor Ragnarok but hell be loved forever for Jojo Rabbit. Watching Jojo's trailer and knowing Taika's past movies, you know this movie is gonna be extremely funny and have a heart. However Jojo will surprise audiences on how invested they will become for these characters and see that people are deeper than they think they are. By the end of the film, all the characters will teach the audience that we can be more than what is expected of us and that life is more beautiful when we enjoy the moments and care for each other. This film sends the message to love life, family, friends, and dance whenever you can."
JOJO RABBIT,20 June 2020,10/10,Without a doubt one of the best films I've had the pleasure of watching. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was great. Watiti did an excellent job giving a unique perspective into the horrors of the Third Rich. I would definitely recommend watching it and I'm disappointed that this film never got the recognition it deserves.
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"A very rare bird indeed this film is as it will make you laugh and cry and is totally original. All the actors perform impeccably and the comedic timing is absolutely spot on.
A very poignant film that has a lot to do with the brainwashing of Children that can lead to disgusting prejudices. A heavy hitting subject that's been handled in a way that leaves you with hope and I left the cinema tears eyed but In awe of the genius of this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,1/10,"Literally worst movie ever. 2 hours I'm never getting back. Not funny, not intriguing, nothing at all."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2021,10/10,"This film has it all!!! Very funny, every actor has performed their characters perfectly. The whole family will love this!"
JOJO RABBIT,2 December 2020,7/10,"For me as a German the roles of Captain K and Jojos mom are clearly acting like the cliche American (posture, weapons (beginning), behaviour), which is very unfortunate.The main reason why I still think the movie is still a good one relies on the conversations and the character development of Jojo and Elsa. Part of Jojos development is shown in Jojos conversations with Adolf, which is the only comedic effect in the movie, which Im fond of, because it shows Jojos childish behavior and him growing up.I dont see why the plot would need any comedic effect, other than that (Adolf), specially since most of it is very shallow and some of it not even amusing."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,4/10,"Welp, i didnt like ""what we do in the swadows"" but i wanted to watch this one since i like black comedies and i was expecting something like DoS.I got bored like 30 minutes in , the only scenes that made me laugh were the ones with Sam Rockwell.This is overhyped and overrated just like What we do in the shadows."
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,1/10,"Its been run into the ground no one is going to see these movies besides the ""woke cult"" of self hating white people. No one cares you're all wasting your time and money be creative and make movies no one has seen before. I hope all the hollywood hacks fall into the ocean and never return."
JOJO RABBIT,23 May 2020,10/10,"The funniest film i have ever seen, yet also one of the saddest. Perfect mix of humour and seriousness. An absolutely amazing film. I love it, would totally recommend it to anyone."
JOJO RABBIT,29 August 2020,7/10,A Nice and Freshly Served. Melodrama Journey of Sweet Emotions and Careness.
JOJO RABBIT,3 November 2019,9/10,"Based on the trailers I saw on television, I was expecting some sort-of Monty-Python-eqsue send-up. It was not that at all. Don't get me wrong, it has it funny moments, and the absurdity is part of what allows it to have Hitler in it (sort-of) and still be a proverbial ""endearing"" film.The cast is great, including (but not limited to!) Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell.I suspect it will get a nod for best screenplay, and possibly more.Don't be scared-off by the subject mater (Hitler Youth, etc.). It is dealt with in a way at least implies (if not accurately represents) the way in which a society can try to brain-wash its youth right at their youngest and most impressionable ages.But, don't expect Monty-Python or South Park either.Not really a spoiler, but pay attention to the mother's shoes, you'll cry when you see them again later."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,9/10,"Hilarious satire that only Taika could walk the line of. Come for the laughs, remember it for the emotion."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,8/10,"Point blank periodt, I believe this movie is on the verge of setting an unhealthy precedent for comedy in regards to what content is on and off limits. That being said this film was brilliantly executed from the gorgeously detailed cinematography and a stunning performance by all actors. Jojo's antihero complex serves his audience in a very raw and specific way. One thing I hate in films is the absence of light and color and this film just shows that movies can be pretty and sad and funny. Would recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"It is somewhat uncomfortable in the beginning to view Hitler as a comic foil, but once you get the pacing this movie unfold beautifully as a comedy and touching drama. Very well done and enjoyable."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,7/10,"This film is kind of odd and it feels like horror and comedy are clumsily combined, but I think that's the point.
It shows the massive contrast of human behaviour, the stupidy of war and takes you from slapstick comedy to tears in the next scene.
It falls down on believability and I think the comedy would work better if more subtle, but I think the slapstick style is what's intended.
Either way you kind of need to see it and had everyone talking about it afterwards."
JOJO RABBIT,13 April 2020,9/10,"This movie is great, it has not only great comedy which will make you laugh and giggle, but when some scenes are of a serious nature it will make you emotional without you seeing it coming, would thourghly recommend."
JOJO RABBIT,7 January 2020,9/10,"I'll be honest, when I saw the previews to this film I thought it was an outright comedy spoof following a little boy and his best friend hitler during WW2. I was wrong! This film caught me by surprise. I laughed, cried, smiled and was left speechless. Honestly a true film that brought so many emotions to the table. Highly recommend to the film enthusiast. Comedy, drama, action. Beautiful movie!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 December 2019,10/10,"This movie was BRILLIANT! Taika Waititi has proven himself as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation. There were two parts that made the movie for me, when he just jumped out the window for no reason, and when he was wearing the Native American head dress. The entire time he was wearing it, there was no reference or explanation to it....COMEDY GOLD! The cast was amazing, Scarlett Johanson and Sam Rockwell deliver Oscar worthy performances. I can not recommend this movie enough!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 December 2019,8/10,I came into this file with low expectations. Trailer didn't excite me and I am not the biggest fan of films on Nazi Germany or Hitler. Bored with nothing much else to do I went to see this movie with hopes of sitting through a mediocre comedy at best just to pass the time. What I got though was far more than I expected. JoJo Rabbit reminds me of films like Shaun of the Dead who promise of pure comedy is bundled with a gift drama. I like nothing better than a comedy that can make you cry without taking itself too seriously. I give this movie a strong 8 as I was a pleasant surprise.
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2021,4/10,"This movie is overall boring. If you have problems with your sleeping schedule, well try to look at this movie and you will fall asleep asap! The Hitler character was nothing like real Hitler! This Hitler made him look like a silly, harmless, little child. When the real Hitler was a harsh and dangerous man. He would never let any of his men fall in love with a jewish girl! The nazi would probably been shot before he where able to blink, even if he was a boy.
The movie tries to be funny but the jokes are very childish! The acting is good but often very cringeworthy and the story is okay.
The movie becomes a lot better during the last half hour. The rest of the movie is actually worth to sleep through. I saw the movie in a group of 20 people and nobody enjoyed it."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,8/10,"To say that all Germans by default were Nazis is an unfair assessment especially when living under a political terror where the mind is predisposed to the propaganda machine. The lie and the idea becomes the truth and reality. The mind of a child is at greater risk; susceptible to the indoctrination of violent politics. The imagination is attacked and exploited for extremism. An adult, unlike a child, is at an age of reason; therefore you may find the former abhorrent, but what of the latter? This is the question Jojo Rabbit attempts to explore with caustic examination.An exploration of how the imagination is hijacked makes for an ambitious topic. Waititi adopts a fitting satire and drama for this purpose, though at times can feel misguided. When balancing two approaches he treads a fine path between the sublime and the ridiculous. If you have ever been around children growing up you know they go through a phase of pretend. They are at play: whether it be with a Buzz Light Year costume or playing with Star War toys a child projects their imagination and identity into the role-play. Would a child in Nazi Germany be any different? The films denotes Nazism as hijacking this stage of growing up, represented in the make-believe Hitler character. This idea is aptly expressed in the imagery of the fuhrer eating a unicorn, a metaphor for the destruction of the imagination. The film's motif is littered with an array of both dramatic and satirical symbolism in the same manner as the unicorn. Mise en scène provides butterflies, knifes, mirrors, shoes and cigarettes representative for Jojo's internal conflict. For example: knifes and cigarettes are objects of assimilation. Mirrors stand in for character duality and shoes for repressed love."
JOJO RABBIT,13 June 2020,10/10,"Nothing about the war is beautiful, but Taika Waititi's this film about war is. Jojo Rabbit makes us experience the war like never before. Through the eyes of a Hitler youth, this story will slowly build its way to your heart and just when you are the most vulnerable or when you will be least expecting, it will shred your heart into tiny little pieces, such little pieces that even a simple shot of a shoe will make you cry like a baby.
War is tragic, add a little comedy to it and you can never be the same."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,9/10,"Taika Waititi's latest satirical take on the Nazi youth is heart wrenching, hilarious and beautiful.Despite my fears that the film was going to go down the route of using the shocking subject matter to compensate for poor writing or to get a cheap laugh through dark comedy, This film once again showed the world that Taika Watiti is one of the most talented and comical directors of the modern day. In the plot we follow our 10yr old main character JoJo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) as he aspires towards becoming one of Adolf Hitler's Elite Guards, however his progress towards his goal was quickly Hampered by a devastating injury and the discovery of what his mother (Scarlet Johanson) has been hiding right under his nose...Roman Griffin Davis gave stellar performance as the title character, helping convey that the young manipulated boy has a heart of gold outside of the diabolical brainwashing he has endured. Scarlet Johanson gave it her all as JoJo's rebellious mother, portraying a kind and resilient parent. However, it is undeniable that Taika Watiti as a 10 yr old's perception of Hitler steals the show from start to finish, as he makes arguably the worst man to walk the earth seem likeable. Other notable performances would have to go to Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa Korr, a jewish girl being housed in secret by JoJo's mother and Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, a disgraced Nazi higher up put in charge of the training of the Nazi youth.The writing of the film is simply sublime, with funny quotable's left and right, Watiti's dark comedic style really shines through every inch of the film. A great example of this is when JoJo unwittingly blows himself up with a grenade after being inspired by imaginary Hitler to be more courageous. Yet the film is also great at showing that it has heart, mainly seem through Jojo and his mother's heartwarming relationship and the sibling like love between Jojo and Elsa. The film portrays its subject manner graciously, as it holds nothing back when poking fun at the Nazis, yet it never shied away from showing how wretched they areThe streets of 1940s Germany are portrayed in a very colourful fashion mostly due to amazing set design and beautiful cinematography. Extra care seemed to be given to make every set lit perfectly for the scene and time period, as well as having every uniform as realistic as possible to add to this believable setting. The film looks very crisp and refreshing, most likely because of the lack of terrible CGI and great use of angles.Overall JoJo Rabbit is a great satire that doesn't rely on cheap laughs and shock value to deliver its anti hate message in an amusing fashion, with terrific performances and great writing JoJo Rabbit may be one of the best satires of the decade

9/10"
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is great. A perfect example that Comedy can be spiced with history. Of course there are things that are 100% imagined by the director like Roman-like suit or a gatling gun or a bunch of aryan clones in the hitlerjugend Headquarters. And there is historical innacuracy, like the Panzershrek rockets exploding with a rather big radius (until it hit a ammo storage) , kids using REAL M24 grenades for TRAINING , and surviving a blast from one thats half a meter in front of you (im not kidding, it only resulted in a minor leg injury and a bunch of scars on your face, even it the grenade has barely any fragmentation effects). Other than that, the movie has only a few sad parts. The boy talks with imaginary hitler, they burn books and stuff. This movie wont make you laugh very loudly but rather make you smile more than usual. Great representation of volkssturm and Hitlerjugend or Jungvolk as in the movie. Female hitlerjugend having problems with using a MP3008. Ms bertha strapping grenades to kids and telling them to hug enemy soldiers (xD) or telling Yorki he got ""promoted"" and gives him a pistol. I got a little bit triggered with the MG42 carried by Bertha. The firerate is waaaay to slow and she just doesnt give a crap and hip-fires it. Of course, No recoil. Good to watch with your family.
9/10

JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,10/10,This movie brought out every emotions in me. One of the best films in a long time. I cried I laughed at the same time. Its amazing
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,8/10,"What do you want in a movie? Fun, Satire, Dark, Sad, Relationships, World war. These things make up a story that we have never experienced in the past. This is truly a masterpiece from Waititi. This film clearly portrays how blind faith towards nationality can backstab you, how dreams are shattered and you begin to see your real self only when you go through the utmost pain, while losing something you only had."
JOJO RABBIT,18 February 2020,10/10,"What a movie, maybe never laughed so hard at a movie. Nice made with a lot of humor and sorrow in one."
JOJO RABBIT,10 March 2020,9/10,"This is a great movie it was funny enough to be lighthearted at times when also being sad and serious at others the end result was a nice ""WW2 Comedy"" that didn't treat the entire war as a joke or make fun of people suffering during those dark times.Great Work"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit achievement impress a lot of people, that in first moment they thought that would a mediocre comedy more.
The surprise it was big
in the face of a very great film,
becoming an example of what comedy cinema should be in the future.This film has to a touch new and
gives us a focus different about the Second World War.
A focus more live and interesting. Waititi achieves put on the impact of the war in one Child,
in him life, playing with the laughs and tears of the spectators in one history
quite entertaiment, changing, very funny and very good structured,
with an excellent script, so much that he was awarded at the Oscars, and a talented cast, with a Scarlett Johansson who finished a wonderful year for her.
A great sample of good cinema, and
above all, one of the best movies of the year.
Fantastic"
JOJO RABBIT,22 March 2020,8/10,"This film was probably the 2nd best movie i have ever seen in the year of 2019. Taika Waititi did a bang up job creating this comedy action movie. Something about Jojo's personality always intrigued me because i remembered myself when i was a kid. But I really enjoyed the storyline and the actors and actresses. something i wish Taika did was portrait Johansson even more in the movie. If you are a person who hasn't watched Jojo Rabbit yet, i will not include what happens to her but it really did bring me to tears when he found out in the one scene with his mom. A mother's love and sacrifice is always important for a child.
Beautifully made, lots of laughs, lots of tears, but all in all, beautiful movie."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,1/10,Doesn't deserve all the buzz. Comedy is super hard to do right and the movie is by all means not universally funny.
JOJO RABBIT,6 August 2020,10/10,Feel sad about the kids in the war. Hope no war will happen on this world anymore.
JOJO RABBIT,9 March 2020,10/10,THIS ONE deserves the Oscars more than Parasite! it make you laugh with guilt hahahah deserves attention
JOJO RABBIT,17 May 2020,9/10,"They never get it right do they and the lower down the pecking order the more spectacular their pompous self aggrandisement becomes.
Jojo Rabbit is not a deep, clever or especially edgy film, GOOD! I don't suppose it was meant to be.
Simple will trump everything in my opinion when it comes to getting a message across, it's called the art of storytelling. It will do so, shock horror, because most people have more than enough complexity in their life without adding to it. They go to films or watch TV to be entertained, when oh when will these egotists work that out.
Jojo rabbit does that and yet still manages quite well enough to get its core message across. It shows the absurdity of totalitarian regimes through the eyes of children, who are nature's finest critics.
There is nothing wrong with deep, edgy and meaningful, it has its place. However being so doesn't make it superior, unless of course feeling superior is your aim!
I loved this film, wasn't what I expected. The performances of the two young boys alone should make it worth two hours of anyone's time. Despite a few unpleasant scenes it was also family friendly, not bad for a film about the horrors of Nazism.
Cheer up though lads, I'm sure some incomprehensible Euro dirge will be along soon enough and then you can feel all intellectually masterful again."
JOJO RABBIT,4 September 2020,10/10,"I was a young child when the war in Yugoslavia happened so I experienced war first hand. It's a very a serious matter that is the worst of humanity BUT the thing that keeps you going and gives you hope is humor, friendship, love...the best of humanity.Some might be angry that this movie makes light of the war, but I believe it's the opposite. It balances the best of humanity with the worst. It makes you laugh one second and cry the next. Doing this requires brilliance, which I believe this movie is."
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2020,6/10,"Kinda cringe, watch Fire Emblem Three Houses
Not enough deep storytelling
The graphics aren't as good as Fire Emblem Three Houses"
JOJO RABBIT,14 May 2020,10/10,"Watch this movie with zero expectations.I, for one, expected it to be a dark comedy, which is by far the reason to watch this genre, and guess what-- it is, and the tables turned. I thought of this as a feel-good movie to add to my collection but nah, it pulls your heart out. It gives us the full realization:war is a really bad thing. No one needs it, no one wants it. Scarlett Johansson takes the role as the sweet and romantic mother who gives Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis) the optimism and values a child could get in a fanatic world of Nazism. Supporting casts are great. Taika Waititi's best film to date.That butterfly scene with the beautiful score will get you."
JOJO RABBIT,7 September 2020,10/10,I panned this from the clips I saw. Yet it was so much more than I thought. Profoundly Poignant and overwhelming touching. Bravo!!!
JOJO RABBIT,17 July 2020,10/10,"My second favorite movie.
This is one of the films which could make me cry"
JOJO RABBIT,21 June 2020,10/10,"It made me and my family crack up, and taught us a bit about WWII"
JOJO RABBIT,16 June 2020,10/10,My husband and I bought this movie and have watched it nearly every date night since the quarantine has started! It's delightfully hilarious but incredibly heartbreaking all wrapped into one! The acting is wonderful and we'll continue to enjoy this little treasure for years.
JOJO RABBIT,2 July 2020,9/10,"A very well done movie, with an awkward, hilarious, and moving plot. Revealing some of the tragic realities of WWII, while developing a strong character base, and showing the change in Jojo as he realized which side he was really on.Definitely worth the watch. I'll do it again sometime."
JOJO RABBIT,1 August 2020,6/10,"I love Taika, and I love the acting in this movie... the story just didn't quite cut the custard for me. No deadline, no winding up of the clock for a big emotional release at the end... A lot of potential, a lot of character, but ultimately I wouldn't give it the gold star."
JOJO RABBIT,14 August 2020,7/10,"This film will leave a strong sense of bittersweet left in your mouth when you're done with it. The trailer portrays what you will be getting into; a funny, cute take on some familiar and loving faces in the WW2 era. However we quickly learn early on and throughout the film that the darkness of WW2 is prevelant in this story and will leave you with a heavy heart. This is another absolutely colourful film."
JOJO RABBIT,2 September 2020,7/10,"Despite the laughter that the film brought us, there are some details that must be emphasized and it is the cruel reality that existed in the war"
JOJO RABBIT,3 September 2020,8/10,"A comedy like many but with its black and serious touch that gives the twist that you do not expect in a comic movie, which makes it more than deserving of its OSCAR"
JOJO RABBIT,14 September 2020,9/10,There was a delicate balance between the seriousness of the war and perfectly timed comedic relief. It was done well.
JOJO RABBIT,26 November 2020,10/10,That excuse didn't work on this one.....Jesus christ I cried.
JOJO RABBIT,18 October 2020,10/10,"Everyone should watch this great movie, whether you are an old or young person , it doesn't matter. This is a Master piece.."
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2021,8/10,"Nazis, racism and war from the perspective of children."
JOJO RABBIT,23 October 2021,3/10,"I didn't laugh at a single one of the jokes, maybe that was just personal taste. But the rapidly shifting tone and confused messages was very off-putting."
JOJO RABBIT,24 July 2021,6/10,Story is good but there is a big problem. I like collor pallette on this film. Colors is really live and fresh. The beginnig of the movie is good. Then movie is getting boried. Acts was really impressive but this isn't enough for the good movie. Sorry.
JOJO RABBIT,28 August 2021,9/10,"This film was fantastic. It took extremely weird turns from sadness to happiness, but that's what makes this movie so... Weird, and unlike any. It's a fun comedic film about a young boy who is took to a training during the times of World War II, and while returning, realises that his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic. The film is hilarious, but it also explores how brutal World War II truly was. Highly recommend!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 September 2021,9/10,Making Northland proud. Directed to perfection. Acting was outstanding. Story line is as funny AF. Well done.

JOJO RABBIT,6 August 2020,8/10,"Heartwarming, good actings, interesting unexpected storyline."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"There are so many movies out there these days, but so few films. This was a film and brilliant one at that. Whereas films like Once Upon A Time in Hollywood seem so smug and self congratulatory, this film is made with pure unaffected passion and heart. Brilliant performances from the cast, great sets, cinematography, costumes, direction, soundtrack and creative writing. The audience is not spoon fed information like in Marvel movies, but instead brought on a ride and free to go where imagination takes us...
This movie knows exactly what satire should be and if you don't, you might want to look up the definition before you see this. Or just go watch a formulaic marvel or self righteous movie like OUATinHollywood, instead."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,10/10,"A cinematic triumph in every way: the comedy, humanity, drama, and triumph. But whoever was hired to make the trailers for the film, and whoever greenlighted them, should never be permitted to work in Hollywood again. They really undercut the power and intelligence of the film with their slapstick comedy approach. Now granted, there were many absurdist comedic elements (and they were hilarious... I also must note that Sam Rockwell gives an understated classic performance), but the film was so much more rich than I had ever imagined. Excellent film by any measure."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,10/10,"A good time at the movies, that's all I need. The boy was such a good actor and the comedy was spot on, a little sad too at times. Go see it :)"
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,Great script - beautiful filmmaking. I love Wes Anderson's work - and I hope this doesn't anger anyone - but I get this kind of humor - so I like Taika Waititi and this film as well. Excellent!!!!
JOJO RABBIT,16 July 2020,7/10,An innovative comedy movie that make jokes with real world. You can watch it with every mood you have. The end of the movie is very highlighted.
JOJO RABBIT,30 October 2019,10/10,Don't miss this movie!!! Incredible writing and directing by Taika Waititi. Amazing balancing act of using humor to tell a serious and heavy story. Incredible performances all around. Should get lots of awards. .
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,10/10,"What we have? Bit of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, a bit of The Book Thief, a bit of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, a bit of Roberto Benigni's La vita e bella and you will get the Best movie of 2019 so far.Short review, but it is enough to understand that this movie is Mustwatch.Especially the scene with the butterfly in the square. That thrilling moment.p.s. Yeah, I know that the Joker and Irishman exists."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2020,6/10,"I was expecting a movie that was an accurate representation of the time but instead it felt sanitised, nearly Disney-esque. Not showing Jojo's mother face when hanging felt a bit of a cop out. Thought the young actors performances were good, though there German accents wavered at times and the acting sometimes felt corny. Overall a very watchable, but quickly forgettable, movie."
JOJO RABBIT,14 June 2020,10/10,"How to split up the one star ratings......hmmm......Jewish individuals, neo nazi individuals (cant really call them individuals though, can you?) or moronic individuals. Don't like the film, fine....but that one star DEFINATELY carries with it a whole lot of agenda.....oh, and the director? HE'S got four balls!Am.a.zing movie with amazing actors."
JOJO RABBIT,24 May 2020,8/10,"I went into the movie expecting a comedy, but what I got felt like a mix between Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom and Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful.
It seems like a weird mix but it manages to work quite well backed up with stellar performances and charming characters."
JOJO RABBIT,29 October 2019,10/10,"As a German, I loved everything about this movie. Absurdity from these times is captured amazingly, and now, almost a century afterwards, we can take it with some humor. Well done, I hope this movie goes on to win some awards."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,9/10,"Well written and balanced. Reminds us how stupid humans act sometimes, but change can happen."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,10/10,"In the age of outrage culture in a America and the stupification/pussification of the West, this film, for some, will be extremely offensive. For others, it will be a dark satirical introspection of the soul of a youth, especially one thrust into a situation they did not choose. Mark Twain once said:There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty: ""When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend.""We find common ground...even in the darkest of places."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,7/10,"One thing that bothers me about this film, and that I have a hard time getting over, is the casting of Thomasin McKenzie as the sole Jewish character. Yes, the Nazis are portrayed as stupid, ignorant, and buffoons, but their ugly caricatures of Jews (rats, horns, scales, evil, etc.) are relentless. Yes, of course, the Jewish character in the film is the complete opposite of the caricatures; she's beautiful, strong, sensitive, loving.But my issue is this: Thomasin is not Jewish! She's a New Zealander of Anglo-Celtic origin. She doesn't even look remotely Jewish, outside of her brown hair. Couldn't they have cast a Jewish actress for the role of the ONLY Jewish character in the film? People still make fun of old westerns where they cast white guys as Native Americans. It just feels insensitive, dismissive, disrespectful, wrong."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,10/10,"Utterlly mesmerizing an emotional rollercoaster of life and psychology, beautifully portrayed to show how life can be just awful but beautiful when all seems lost...."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,8/10,"Laughed and cried then laughed and cried again
Good film. Highly recommend"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,4/10,"I never review a movie but I had to that this time.
The acting is good and its the only good thing in this film,
Not funny at all. I don't understand how people can find this humor funny.
Waste of a 30 min of my life, didn't even got further then that."
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,9/10,"This is the best funny sad movie... or sad funny movie I've seen in a long time. It's such a funny movie and at the start you don't even realise it's about the war. But then the sad scenes happen, wrapped in between funny scenes so you don't realise at first its a sad scene... and then it hits you extra hard. The movie made me laugh out loud and cry. Well done."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,10/10,"There are few movies that are in the next stratosphere. Shawshank redemption, Lars and the real girl, The secret life of Walter Mitty, And now Jojo rabbit. The redemption of the characters is so addicting that I might just need to rewatch it immediately."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,10/10,"Although it felt weird in the beginning to laugh at something so serious as WWII, this movie just made it happen really easily. Such great acting, and such a great story. Loved it!"
JOJO RABBIT,24 March 2021,4/10,"I didn't laugh once and the film didn't hold my attention. I was surprised given the people involved. Can't put my finger on why, just didn't find it compelling in any way."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,2/10,"I know its suppose to be a story seen by ten years old boy but this movie is such a shortcut, such a flat, predictable narration. No point to touch the topic, mixing comedy and drama. Maybe for Americans this how the II WW did look like but for Europeans, it was a horror."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was incredible!To put it briefly amazing,hilarious,compassionate, and award worthy!"
JOJO RABBIT,9 May 2020,3/10,Terrible film completely stupid not funny at all would have been a better movie if it was more serious hitler is a clown in this movie .
JOJO RABBIT,9 May 2020,10/10,I am a typical movie junkie. I like all kinds of movies. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,3/10,"Legitimately dumbfounded as to how this film got such high ratings and award nominations. It just wasn't good. Without Rockwell or Scarlett, no one would care about it"
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2021,10/10,"I saw this twice in theaters, paid to watch it more than once at home, and finally bought it. Can't wait to watch it again."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,2/10,"I found it boring and uninteresting, only 30 minutes into the movie I lost complete interest. This kind of comedy is childish and forced... I couldn't connect with any of the characters and really couldn't stomach the infantile tone of the comedy of this kind. Maybe is just not my type, watch it for yourself, maybe I'm in the minority"
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2020,9/10,Definitely one for the library ! A must have movie in your WWII collection.
JOJO RABBIT,16 March 2020,10/10,What a fabulous movie. Funny yet touching. Hard hitting and so heartwarming.
JOJO RABBIT,23 August 2020,9/10,Man. Phewww. i laughed and cried. I am sure the words will fall short to describe this movie. I really dont understand how come it is only 7.9 on IMDb. it should be at least 9.KUdos
JOJO RABBIT,14 November 2020,10/10,"Just watched this movie for the 2nd time. The blend of comedic excellence with harrowing reality really impacted on me again. Stunning performances by the young leads and Sam Rockwell is becoming my favourite actor ever. It is a difficult subject matter to ever 'make light' of but in this case I don't think it actually does do that. The bits we feel comfortable laughing at are there to set us up for the shocking truth of this period. It isn't a comedy, it isn't a war movie, it is just a film. A film about humanity and how important it is to find yourself before being yourself."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,A powerful film that blends humour and hope with historical accuracy.It has some memorable lines and shows the dreadful consequences of a police state and war.
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,But this was a perfect coming-of-age story that delivered in every way possible.
JOJO RABBIT,22 June 2020,9/10,"Very subtle performances with a subtle fore-shadowing of a lot of moments to come in the film.
The writing is so brilliant that you actually get transported to the world of Nazi era.
The role of Hitler is nicely portrayed by the director himself which gives a nice flavour to the film."
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,10/10,"You know how every movie has some part of it that you can criticise later, maybe mindless action, too long, maybe some part boring, too many super heroes,
BUT THIS MOVIE WAS SPOTLES!! no spoilers here, just watch and enjoy...."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,9/10,"A film full of heart and detail, Taika has created an undulating film that makes your heart soar, laugh and break.Taiki's Hitler, full of comedy and satire is as fickle and fluctuating as young Jojo's view of his Fuhrer.
Young JoJo played by Roman Griffin Davis is honest and grounded despite the nature of the narrative and his innocent view of the world. Scarlett Johansson, plays her role creatively an beautifully and gives real heart and depth to the story.
Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen give outrageous and joyous performances and light up the screen time they have."
JOJO RABBIT,10 May 2020,9/10,"There's no such thing as a perfect 10, but this movie comes close. The movie lures you in with its comedy, but gradually overtakes you with its tragedy, yet still maintains a sense of optimism. (I know that sounds nonsensical , but if you watch the movie you'll see what I mean.) Captain Klenzendorf's final scene is one of the most moving scenes in cinema ever, yet it happens so quickly that you don't even appreciate its significance immediately. The beginning and ending musical selections are stunningly perfect."
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,10/10,"You should see this... modern humor, good actors, deep messages.."
JOJO RABBIT,1 August 2020,10/10,"I was amazed by the ability of this movie to evoke such polarised emotions. Just watched it again (4th time) and was still riveted to the screen. A tick in every box and a modern masterpiece. I want to single out a performance, but which one. We all know Sam Rockwell is brilliant in everything he does, but we need more of Scarlet in roles that display her awesome talent and screen presence. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie shone as the lead characters and we will see much more of them I'm sure. But when a movie is this good, it comes down to writing, script, screenplay and direction. The word Masterpiece shouldn't be used lightly, but I use it here."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,9/10,"Just brilliant. Enjoy it. Laugh, cry and cringe. It's a wonderful film"
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,10/10,"A rare mix of emotions with this movie. A bit long, but keeps you captivated and wanting for more, even during the credits."
JOJO RABBIT,14 January 2020,10/10,"Watching this movie has brought so many amazing emotions. Wonderfully moving and hilarious at the same time. God, this is a wonderful film!"
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,1/10,"Great photography, costume on point; however humor got stuck somewhere between WWII and 2020. If you are looking for a history fiction twist taken out of 5 year old kid brainstorm, this movie might be for you."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,10/10,Tearful comedy.It made to my top 20 movie list of all time.
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,5/10,"To me it's not funny at all. Great message though, but the story is just inappropriate."
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,An amazing film a must see And a great reminder of how the world is could be and will be If you dance.
JOJO RABBIT,28 January 2021,9/10,A film that's beautifully written and beautifully shot. So well balanced with humour and emotion that doesn't hide the damage caused by Nazi Germany but manages to present it from multiple unique viewpoints through fantastic performances from all of the actors.
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2021,6/10,"Seriously, the trailer only shows the 10 funny scenes from the movie and makes it seems like it is a hilarious comedy film. However, the movie is 90% drama.Jojo rabbit in well made, theatrical movie. Holocaust is such a serious topic and making these things seem funny can be difficult. Perhaps that is why the movie was not that much of a comedy after all. I felt like it was somewhat too weird."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,7/10,The was this too in Germany... Good people and kids.
JOJO RABBIT,5 November 2019,10/10,"I laughed. I cried.. Thank you, Taika Waititi, for this amazing film!Hands-down the best I've seen in 2019!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,9/10,"Walked in wanting to see a comedy, but this film was such a beautiful surprise, constantly shifting from really deep and dark to bananas.
Loved the film! It was such an exñerience."
JOJO RABBIT,8 March 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi show us how humor, color, joy, sadness, tears, war, sacrifice and love can be all blended into a masterpiece. You may never see a wwII movie like this again in your entire life.
Both young actor and actress did an outstanding performance bringing their characters to life, making us feel the beauty and pureness of their souls. If you are disappointed by life and wanna gain back some hope/love, watch this movie. It's a detox for your heart."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,9/10,"First of all the satire in the fact that this movie is a comedy coming from the lense of a ""nazi"" little boy was super original and I loved it. Everything works perfect together. The entire movie is bright and fun but there's always this undertone that the war will end soon and this naive town will soon plummet into reality that their icon (Hitler) is one of the most evil men of all time. Sam Rockwell was the standout roll in this movie since he really made the audience care about his outrageous character and I loved every minute he was on screen. This movie is packed full of heart."
JOJO RABBIT,19 June 2020,8/10,The story was engaging and hilarious. The innocence of characters was nicely defined. A movie worth watching while spending your weekend and giving off the stress!!
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,10/10,"My grandparents lived in this time. I am from the Netherlands and the ""horrific deeds and thoughts"" they did not know. They saw the Germans, talked to them played next to them. The where in power. Most of them had no idea what happend to the Jews. The knew there was a war, but there perception was so different same as there knowledge.So if this subject interests you go and watch it. It's dramatic, loveable, sad and has some humor in it to tell the story a different way! Well done! It keeps the subject alive, even after 75 years, we cannot forget!"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2021,9/10,"Serious problems of history is told in a comedy way..it's amazing, just watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,7/10,"This wasn't a bad movie, it was a good movie with the potential to be a great movie.PROS
very funny - genuine laugh out loud momentsgreat acting by allgreat first half, good intro and development of characters
CONS
the second half of the movie was too predictable, there was no punchline ending, no deeper meaning, it was cliche. Movies like pans labraynth and life is beautiful had their similar moments of surrealism, but ended up showing the horror of the war that came afterwards. But jojo ends with the dancing of the main characters on a street that should have been teeming with post war destruction and rape that we know was the reality of the war. All I could see when was 'man these kids are in for a world of hurt'. It skipped out on an upbeat level of optimism that I think takes away from portraying an authentic picture of the war. Some may argue that this was childhood innocence maybe for the last time before the reality of pain take a over, but I felt it to be lacking. Other films like inglorious bastards recreated the entire history, which then makes it fine to have a positive ending. But jojo decided to keep to the real world events, but opted for a jarring fantasy ending.hitler was the side of jojo that wanted to feel needed and accepted, and it took the form of hitler who he loved and admired. But, as he is a friend and creation of jojo, I think it would have been more interesting for imaginary hitler to adopt and reflect the changes jojo undergoes as he falls in love. It would have been a powerful symbol if his hitler was sympathizing and supporting of his decisions to help the girl, while the real hitler was out there killing millions of Jews. I think by having him eventually kick his hitler out of a window played into hands of the predictable, where as this could of been a moment of a deeper exploration into good and evil. Imagine a movie that makes you adore hitler.they could of done more with the rabbit part. The film is called jojo rabbit, he identifies himself as the rabbit early on with scenes of great set up - not killing the rabbit and then his talk with his hitler, so I thought that theme could of been fleshed out more. Maybe put him into a situation into the climax of the movie where he consciously has to decide to be the rabbit and use his rabbit brain, and do something that only he can do. Perhaps the antagonist (the guy who killed the rabbit) could have been a part of him proving himself in the same way that PK had to prove himself in the film the power of one against the one German boy.the movie tried to occupy too many scenes. I think the story would of worked better if they kept it mostly within the house. When they started going outside with the battles, it lost a lot of the tension as the film was trying to do too much. It could have indicated the war was intensifying, which was done well when they are at the window looking at the battle, but the movie map was too big. But what was the real point of jojo witnessing the war? There would have been better ways in order to show the effect of the war other than him running around seeing the horror.casting: rebel Wilson plays the same character in every movie I found. Her scenes I felt just took away from the power of the scenes. While I found jojo and hitler to be funny, rebel only made the scenes silly and not in the good way. And scarlett did a good job, but all I could see was black widow. I therefore found her character distracting and drawing attention to the fact that I was watching a movie, and i couldn't get lost in the movie. Scarlett and rebel didn't bring anything unique to the role, and I think any other actress could have done those roles just as well with more benefit to film. This is the downside of being too famous. Had they used ordinary but real German actors I think it would have gone a long way.some of the actors were speaking in a French or british accent when they were meant to be GermanYorki was very cute, but they really could have used him differently. I feel that all his job was to look as cute as possible. He and no character arc or plot drive. If rebel Wilson's character used him to kamakazi himself then that would be powerful. I liked him, I just don't get why he was there."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2020,3/10,"The idea is amazing, the message is amazing ... but very boring and slow, acting is very bad, I couldn't engage with the movie.. even though the idea is fantastic, but, this movie couldn't touch me.. the jokes are not funny, and the sad parts didn't touch me. I appreciate the effort but I don't recommend this as I find this a waste of time"
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,9/10,"Like life itself, this film runs the gamut from gut-wrenching tragedy to the absurdly comedic, asking audience members to view it through both the innocent/playful of eyes of a child and the profound lens of the sage. At times ridiculous, at others acutely insightful and poignant, Jojo Rabbit teaches us that life is unpredictable, weird, meaningful, sad and joyous at once. I highly recommend this 1 hour, 48 minute cinematic melange of events and emotions."
JOJO RABBIT,11 February 2020,10/10,"An absolute masterpiece. Taika Waititi expertly navigates an extremely difficult subject with grace, humour and reverance.
Tell all your friends.
I'll be seeing it again in the theater, and bringing my whole family... you should too."
JOJO RABBIT,9 April 2020,10/10,"I really enjoyed this movie i was there like every second of it, there was a moment which made me cry so much. I really liked it full of life"
JOJO RABBIT,26 April 2020,7/10,In this movie you will be laughing at one moment and crying at another. It shows how much of information German kids have about the Jews at the time from Nazi's schools and how they define it into another meaning. It's a movie that you can watch with your family where there is no too much drama in it. It reminded me of another movie actually the boy in the striped pajamas but in less dramatic way.
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,9/10,"A story about the life of a young aspiring nazi boy and he's struggles when discoving that he's mother is helping a jew... Oh and hes imaginary best friend hitler (played by waititi) is there along the way.I think that sums up what's so brilliant about this movie and Waititi's vision, Hollywood is filled with the same copy and pasted films and remakes and this is just such a breathe of fresh air! The film is paced amazingly throughout and despite the serious and deep nature of what the film is portraying it truly is hilariously funny whilst still managing to pull on your heart stings! I spent the duration of the film with tears from laughter or sadness.This film really is for true film lovers and portrays so much emotion! Waititi's brilliance is matched by some of the best performances by many great actors with one of the best performances I've seen from Scarlett Johansson by far! it's a 10/10 for sure."
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,3/10,"Some absolutely incredible moments in a marathon of awkward overly styled effort...It felt like there was a shortage of time or budget, leading to a great many mediocre segments added as filler to connect the spectacular moments..."
JOJO RABBIT,1 June 2021,1/10,The only movie I disliked more than this was hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
JOJO RABBIT,18 June 2020,10/10,"Brilliant, funny, sad, warm. Waititi shows that humor can belong anywhere if you do it right. People without a sense of humor will probably hate it, but hey, you can't win over everyone."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,8/10,"The film eschews most of the horror of the Nazi regime in favor of a light and goofy atmosphere. That said, I do think the film expects viewers to bring their historical understanding of the Nazis so it can play with those expectations to humorous effect. That might not be a person's cup of tea, which is totally understandable, but it's a common humorous trope to paint horrible things in a coat of frivolity. Making this film less a useful historical probe, and more a probe into the nature of interpersonal relationships in a society with a clearly wacky and racist dogma. Despite what a person is brought up to believe, real, meaningful experience with those who have been othered can bring about internal change. So yeah, the moral reads more like a Disney film set in absurdist Nazi Germany, but, if you're into that, it's quite charming and oddly wholesome if a bit too lighthearted."
JOJO RABBIT,11 January 2020,10/10,"Was shocked by New Yorker and NY Times negative reviews. It was effective at mocking the insanity and the stupidity of the Third Reich, while also touching your heart. Sam Rockwell is the greatest IMO."
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2019,10/10,Loved every minute of it. A blend of lighthearted fun while still feeling all too real in the heavy moments. 10/10
JOJO RABBIT,29 November 2019,10/10,Ludicrously funny and moving and original.One to cherish.
JOJO RABBIT,3 June 2020,9/10,Its funny and emotional and philosophical and cute
JOJO RABBIT,27 March 2021,9/10,"Simply awesome movie. Very good screen play and execution. Even though it's comedy movie, sometimes it can touch your heart. Very good attempt."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't stop thinking about it.True, it is a very funny satire about the Second World War, but there are moments filled with utter sadness.Direction, production and casting is spot on. Soundtrack is awesome."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,This kid will be a megastar in the future & will so deserve it... Great film
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2019,8/10,"That being said, its a cool movie :) If you are a fan of this guys other flicks then you will probably like this as well."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2021,9/10,"This is one of the most unusual films I've seen in a long time, and all the more refreshingly so in this age of Hollywood franchises, remakes and stock formats. At first, you think you are just going to see a childish, slapstick comedy poking fun at the Nazis but, as the film wears on, it begins to depict the death, tragedy and general horrors of war in ever greater detail, yet continuing to mix it in with scenes that make you laugh - a cameo of life really, where no tragedy is ever completely tragic and no comedy without its more serious sides. It won't be everybody's cup of tea in this PC era, but deserves all the accolades it will surely receive for its ability to uplift you, distress you and then uplift you again within the space of a few minutes. Excellent work by the director and all actors involved."
JOJO RABBIT,23 December 2019,10/10,"I haven't written a review for years but had to give props for this one. The director is brilliant and this movie not only walks the line but also dances alongside it too!
Don't miss out."
JOJO RABBIT,7 May 2020,10/10,"German nationalism, sense of racial-superiority, and profound hatred for jews, are the main themes around which the plot of the entire movie revolves. Jojo, a kid of some 7-8 years of age, is seen to be brought up in the German society where all of the above-stated characteristics are deeply inculcated into his mind and personality. He has been taught by the society that it is Adolf Hitler, who is the true saviour, flag-raiser and hero of the Germans. The kid was made to believe that, with Hitler by their side, they could triumph over even the strongest of the enemies. Jojo, being so much enchanted by the fuhrer's majesty and charismatic persona, had made the fuhrer his imaginary pal, who talks to jojo, discusses war with him, infuses in him the love for Germans and Hitler, while at the same time the hatred for the Jews.Jojo's mother, scarlett Johansson, proved her praiseworthy acting-skills yet again. She has perfectly played the role of a genius mother who brings up her kid in a reasonable manner even in the absence of his father. She outwardly pretends to be an ardent proponent of Germany's machinations but, in reality she provides safe haven to a Jewish girl in her very home. She has been portrayed so much kind and humane that she doesn't hesitate to compromise even her own share of food, and gives it to the hapless Jewish girl. She refuses to turn a blind eye to her humanistic responsibilities even if it requires the sacrifice of her own life."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,Go see the movie with an open mind and be prepared to be amazed
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,"This is what we used to call a Dramedy when we had our video store. Taika Watiti is able to take us on a journey that is like life - traveling through an emotional landscape from comedy to tragedy to poignancy and back again. There are scenes that just make you gasp, they are so unexpected and jarring. Then there are others that prompt belly laughs. According to Sam Rockwell, Taika ""has a really good comedy compass.""
In Hitler's Germany toward the end of WWII, the Nazis are so desperate that they recruit and train 10 year old boys and girls to be ready to fight when the Allies invade their towns. This of course sets up any number of comic situations. Jojo is such a gung-ho little Nazi that his imaginary friend is Hitler himself, who is hysterically portrayed by the director. But the hate and brutality of the Third Reich pops up throughout from time to time, creating contrast that keeps us on the edge of our seats.
The boy, Roman Griffin Davis, is extraordinary in his acting. As you can tell from all the award nominations and wins, the entire cast is excellent, as well as the writing, costumes, editing, etc. Everyone involved in the making of this film talks about how much fun they had.
While there are similarities to Life is Beautiful - a young boy is protected by his parent from the horrors and truth of Hitler's reign - one also has to give a nod to The Producers by Mel Brooks where the play Springtime for Hitler has the monster singing and dancing in silly songs.
In the end, the message of the film comes through that even in the face of unspeakable evil and cruelty, the humanity of enough people will manage, through courage, sacrifice, humor and open hearts, to restore a sense of compassionate community."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,10/10,"Vad Yashem timely; yes helping to remember, "" a Life --altering lesson in love and empathy.."""
JOJO RABBIT,2 November 2019,10/10,"So good. Taika makes you experience joy, terror, love, hate all in one minute and then he jumps out and runs around in a Hitler costume.It's historically accurate too showing the polarisation of Germany during war time, indoctrination into the hitler youth and the storming of Berlin.100% would watch again."
JOJO RABBIT,11 September 2020,10/10,"Funny, touching, timely, human, thought-provoking, a BRILLIANT film!"
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,6/10,"So if you make the movie for peace and love, why you should use unfair view to Russian solders? Don't make sense and spoil all good what was in this movie. I don't like when political was used by independent creators."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,9/10,"I went into the cinema thinking this movie would be a fun poke at the horrors of Nazi Germany.
However I came out of the cinema with many thoughts and most of all a big smile on my face.
Taika Waititi's 2019 movie JoJo Rabbit is the one of the most remarkable movie's period I have seen in my whole life, which made me laugh, cry and even squeal with excitement for what's to come next in this movie which reinvents hoe you think about plot twists.
The movie also contains stellar acting from every soul who appears on screen, Headliners include Scarlett Johansson is who plays the loving mother of JoJo who wants to keep everyone safe. A Pathetic Army Captain played by Sam Rockwell A Surprisingly Likeable Leader of the 3rd Reich played the Magnificent Taika Waititi. However the best performance in the film by far is by the young Roman Griffin Davis who sells off his performance of being a young child during Hitlers reign in Germany so believable if you showed a clip of him in this movie to someone out of context they may think it's archived footage from WW2 Nazi Germany (Only if they haven't heard of this movie of course because these performances need to be heard about more!). Not only is the acting incredible the writing is fantastic! The writing is witty and hilarious when it needs to be and sad and miserable when it needs to be. There is also a direction in this movies is as clear as a black sheep. Mind you this movie was also directed by the man himself Taika Waititi.
To conclude JoJo Rabbit is a movie I can see myself watching for decades in the future and Recommending to anyone who likes movies as it truly is a piece of art that can be enjoyed Or appreciated by anyone. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my review, sorry if it is a bit general but just... cmon see the movie you won't regret it! ( By the way I totally haven't had to search up Taika Waititi's name about 10 times while writing this review)"
JOJO RABBIT,16 October 2019,8/10,First thought it was an insulting movie with brutal jokes about history and historical figures but as more of the movie reveals the movie slowly turned into something touching and poetic. I'm impressed.
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"Loved this movie, I laughed, cried, was shocked and even did some chair dancing. Beautifully made. Taika Waititi is gold!!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,"I usually never rated movies with 10, but this one was special. When a movie makes you think, cry and laugh at the same time, you know that it was great.
You fall in love with all the characters, the good ones and the bad ones. You fall in love with the story, and the places.
The direction was great. The acting was great. The movie is great."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,10/10,"I loved this movie, for me it had everything, I would definitely watch it again"
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,10/10,"This film is a fantastic piece of film making. Yes it is very funny, but it is also thought provoking as well. It does touch on sensitive subjects but makes the Nazi's look like a bunch of fools. There is humour, there is sadness and it shows how understanding another person from a cultural and religious background can change your perception through communication. Go watch this and enjoy....if you're one of the people who rated this movie one star, you're a moron in my opinion."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,9/10,"This movie made my laugh, cry, happy, relieved, everything. This may be the best movie I've seen by far and the acting of scarlet johanson is just great."
JOJO RABBIT,10 March 2020,8/10,"As a fan of Taiki Waikiki's work this film follows his usual trend with being hilarious in a way that is a little bit weird; and that's a great thing.Jojo Rabbit I found to be heard warming and enjoyable and with some great acting. And hats of to the man himself, who wrote the screenplay, directed and starred in this film."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,10/10,"I laughed, I cried, and I laughed while I cried. And I cherished every moment."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I have seen lately. Lots of laughs but also a movie that encourages you to think about a dark chapter of our history and to see it from a new perspective.
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is about a young German boy called Jojo who joins the Hitler Youth but after being bullied by people higher up he ran away and talked to his imaginary best friend, Adolf Hitler. Jojo soon returns, taking a hand grenade, throwing it and accidentally blowing himself up which makes him unfit for the German army so he is restored to staying home and getting a job delivering conscription papers and putting up propaganda flyers. However, he soon discovers a jew hiding in his house and discovers what jews are truly like.Jojo Rabbit is a comedic masterpiece. The casting is amazing and full of talent, the script was brilliant, the pacing was almost perfect and the visuals and cinematography were incredible. This movie is truly going to be a classic that people will watch over and over again for many years to come. It is hilarious but serious and shows exactly what it was like to be a Nazi and a Jew during the second World War while also being humours at the right moments. It shows what the Nazi's has perceived Jews to be and how incorrect they were.The movie has many emotional parts that are not in any way overshadowed by the comedy. Roman Davis did an outstanding job as Jojo, especially at such a young age and in such a complex role. The character of Jojo goes through a huge change during this movie.However, no movie can be perfect and this is my only complaint about Jojo Rabbit; at some points during the first act the pacing felt a little weird and it took a while for the movie to fully progress, however it is only a small nitpick and can easily be overlookedFinal Rating: 9/10"
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,10/10,"This movie was an exceptional work of art, it made me both laugh and cry at the same time.
It really gave insight to how the war was seen in the eyes of young boys.
It was a spectacular creation, hats off to the directors, producers and actors for pulling off such an amazing creation."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,10/10,Movie evolves. Illustrâtes How blind allegiance to daffy ideas is destructive and how one must decide for oneself. Very entertaining. Highly recommend.
JOJO RABBIT,19 May 2020,9/10,"First thoughts it was a comedy about jojo Turn up there are more! Great plot. Bringing tear to my eyes especially in the end ,war is not good for most of us :/"
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,9/10,"I can't remember the last time when I've laughed so many times during a movie! Nearly everyone else at the theater was also laughing. This movie is hilarious and the comedy works well. The ending is very heartbreaking and a painful reminder of the horrors of war.I think the only problems with this movie are some pacing issues and some characters could have used a bit more development. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie and it's definitely one of my new favorite movies!"
JOJO RABBIT,16 June 2020,4/10,"Good day.
(I apologize in advance for using Google translator)
No doubt the movie is good.
Satire.
Drama
Children who are not enraged, who know how to play and perform the task in the frame.
Scarlet, as always, I'm glad to see her, albeit in such a peculiar role.
And everything would be fine, there's only one thing, Taika !!! - WHY THE STAFF OF THE STATES I AM YOUR FILM IN HEROES, A VICTORY ACCESS ENTRANCE IN THE CITY, WITH FLAGS WITH MUSIC, WITH SMILE, RELEASED ...
A MILITARY OF COUNCILS OF TOTALS IS ONLY THE PUNISHING Squad, COUGH, MUJLIANS, SHOOTING ON THE LAW AND THE LEFT, WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSION, AND CHILDREN AND MILITARY NAZIS?
As I understand it, this is Goz zakas, such a policy is such propaganda.
It is a pity that you were taught the false history on which your world is built.
With these last shots, a good attitude towards the film was crossed out.
""Thank"""
JOJO RABBIT,8 October 2020,9/10,I love war movies especially anything about WWII but I honestly went into this thinking it would be stupid and a waste of time. BOY WAS I WRONG! It was a thought provoking anti war movie with laugh out loud scenes. Captain Klenzendorf played by Sam Rockwell displayed a courageous and lovable character which goes against everything we know about the Nazis. And Jojo was hysterical and shows the promise of a long career. Highly recommended!
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,10/10,It's Magnificien and Special....Extraordinary way to show the absurdity of war
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,9/10,"Ever since the trailers for JoJo Rabbit came out, I was a bit nervous about the film and whether will it be able to handle such a delicate subject in a satirical manner but Taika Waititi proved me wrong.The movie is basically about a boy (Roman Griffin Davies) imagining him being friends with Hitler (Taika Waititi) who gives him advice on how to be a Nazi. He later finds out that his mother (Scarlett Johannson) is harboring a young Jewish woman upstairs in the wall. The boy being a radical Hitler supporter has to come in terms with his morals.Taika Waititi successfully changed the tone of the film in a second, making it play with your emotions. He was able to maintain a balance between them.The cinematography and production design was spot on. It legit felt like a World War 2 setting. The soundtrack for the film felt a bit offtrack and did not amplify the movie experience in any way.The cast is packed with some fan favorites like Stephen Merchant, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson. The chemistry between Thomasin McKenzie and Roman Griffin Davies was believable and it delivered in some funny and tensed moments.This felt like a timeless movie and the recurring themes seemed relevant in current generation.Rating: 8.6/10"
JOJO RABBIT,31 October 2019,10/10,Completely hilarious. Completely sad. Completely clever. Completely beautiful. Completely into my top 10. Completely looking forward to watching it again. Completely Taika Waititi.
JOJO RABBIT,16 November 2019,10/10,It's been a while since I have watched an amazing film in the theater. I honestly can't remember. I had gotten use to seeing the same crap over and over. This film broke the streak. Intelligently written with a cast that makes this film truly standout. I was enjoying this film so much I didn't want it to be over. It's as if a witty super intelligent writer was reaching deep inside and sharing his childhood experience of a very troubling time while somehow capturing all of this through a child's eye. I'm not sure if this could have been pulled off with any other cast. The Stars aligned for this film and everything works perfectly. I highly recommend this film.
JOJO RABBIT,24 November 2019,2/10,"To think that ""knowing"" people make you like them is wrong and absurd. Jews in Germany were completely integrated into the society in the 30s. If the point of this movie were true why did most survivors choose to go to refugee camps instead of back ""home""? This is why Israel got statehood. Does the writer-creator think Steven Miller and Steve Bannon don't know Jewish people? In fact Breitbart's banker Mercer is ostensibly Jewish, who seems to be okay fanning the flames of hatred to gain whatever they are trying to gain. Do we think that gay-haters never knew gay people? We all have known and seen LGTBQ people all our lives and they are still generally not respected. This movie might be funny if it wasn't so ridiculously wrong. But there are ""good people on both sides"", including the Nazi marchers in the US who chanted about ""Jews"" the night before with their brown shirts. I guess I just need to get to be better friends with some of them."
JOJO RABBIT,26 October 2019,10/10,This movie satirical humor shines through during the first half before focusing more on heart in the second. The most humorous characters like Yorki and Hitler(I know that sounds bad) although everyone gets good comedic moments. The other characters are more developed anyway and really bring more heart than you'd expect from a movie with such a wild premise. The performances were great and i was particularly impressed with the young actors. This movies message is compassionate and I urge you to see this movie.
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"I can't believe this doesn't have higher reviews from the critics it is amazing, one of the best films I've ever seen. It is hilarious, the imaginary Hitler character is comically brilliant as are a multitude of other moments in the film. But there is a serious undertone which isn't ruined by the comedy, there are heartbreaking and heartwarming moments and I cannot encourage anyone enough to see this film!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,"Honesty! Farce and absurdity of any totalitarian regime.
What brainwashing does for kids.
Love it, Just 10 years old kids perspective .....
Adults should be careful ( and kept responsible) for what they are trying instill in kids brain.."
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2020,10/10,I thought the movie was hilarious and I was already satisfied with the comedy aspect of it but it was also very emotional and I really enjoyed it thoroughly
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,1/10,"Comedy? Hell no! It had a some good jokes but the rest of it are simply unfunny.
Drama? Well, if a movie is a drama just because some characters die, then it is a drama.The characters are unlikeable and unfunny.
The movie is so cringy, I felt physical pain."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,9/10,"I love this movie, you can see the perspective of an innocent child who tries to belong to his reality and that is fun ... But the film has the ability to make a deep reflection on the true drama for the children who lived at that time."
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2019,10/10,"I watched this movie a few days after the news that my father was hospitalized and had a severe stroke. This movie was lighthearted yet didn't undermine the atrocities of the Holocaust. It gave me a new perspective on how to view events that inevitably will happen in ones life. I laughed, I cried, I loved."
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,10/10,"Absolutely enjoyed it, lots of laughs and a very heart warming story."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,5/10,"Pathos scenes are previsible, imaginary Hitler jokes get annoying after his 3rd appearance.
I saw this movie in Germany and the local audience seemed to enjoy the humor but this was rarely my case.
Also the execution of prisoners of wars had to be done by Soviets/Russian and no other allied army... well its an American movie...
On second thought, I never found a Hitler parody movie funny except Chaplin great dictator."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,9/10,This movie is VERY well done. Different. Funny. Sad. Engaging.
JOJO RABBIT,9 January 2020,9/10,I was laughing out loud in the cinema. Wonderfully thought provoking.
JOJO RABBIT,6 September 2020,1/10,"If you want to laugh out loud, skip it. If you think Hitler is funny, this may be your flick."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,1/10,"As suggested by other comments, I looked up the definition of satire and watched the trailers. However, I find little humor in Hitler and his youth. I would suggest watching ""Band of Brothers"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or ""Schindler's List"" to search for humor in a dark period of Western culture.Good luck guys, but you might want to visit your local VFW and see how they feel. Today, maybe Hitler is funny and tomorrow maybe Stalin, Mao, or Kim. A lot of people died fighting these regimes.This is why I have mostly abandoned Hollywood. People putting satire ahead of their roots and history. I was named after a Korean War veteran and I didn't understand the war in youth, but as I get older, Alan Alda can stuff it. I was named appropriately.Good luck with your satire."
JOJO RABBIT,9 November 2019,10/10,"'Jojo Rabbit' is a movie that guides you through all the emotions of a fantastic story that leaves an impact on you! Beautifully crafted with Waititi's humour and empathetic nature you will find your self laughing, crying and sometimes both.'Jojo Rabbit' is my top movie of 2019 and highly recommend to watch on your next day off!"
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,9/10,"At first quite an off putting vibe dealing with the Nazi youth camp.
But an ingenious Waititi serves it well, with insatiable appetite for more.
This movie has it all:
A great cast
Some fear
Some anger
A laugh
A Teardrop
Was missing some more interaction between the 2 main characters, specifically in regard to Elsa's Jewish affiliation.
Regards
'Fireplace-fire'"
JOJO RABBIT,28 October 2019,10/10,"From the trailers I saw the movie theater this looks like a cute funny movie. But if I was wrong, it's so much more than that! Yes there are parts that are funny but some parts are poignant and downright heartbreaking. It is a story about all the confusion and heartbreak war can bring. Taika Waititi's best and a must see"
JOJO RABBIT,15 September 2020,10/10,"If i can use just one word to describe this movie, it would be ""unique"". I´ve seen a lot of movies lately, but none of those movies have made me laugh and cry so hard in differents scenes. Also, this movie is capable to touch a very delicate topic, and transform it into an indcredible satire, with its due touch of reflection.It is definitely worth to watch."
JOJO RABBIT,20 November 2019,10/10,"I had to create an account just so I could tell ya'll how great this movie is. Seriously this is one of my favorite movies, I'm trying to get everyone I know to watch it. It had a perfect amount of comedy and drama. Don't listen to the critics, they have no idea what they're talking about. Please go support this movie, it's seriously fantastic. Great acting all around as well!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 June 2021,8/10,"Generally in a movie like jojo rabbit, the elders of the family (Scarlett's character) are responsible for the bad situation and the children seems to be more sincere, compassionate about others.Although in this particular movie, the child is an extremist (obviously because of the environment in which he is born and bought up) while the character of Scarlett Johansson is trying to put some sense in her boy's brain while also giving shed to a Jew at the same time (which was really brave of her).Because of the following reasons, we feel bad for the boy because he doesn't really know what he was saying, and at the same time we also wish good for Scarlett's character as she might be the only sane person in between all these madmen.The dynamic between the jewish girl and the boy was beautiful. How beautifully she managed to keep her calm and also managed to get the young boy to her side was beautiful.The last and the final thing about the movie which I particularly loved were the conversations that were held between the characters.For example-
The conversation where the boy is talking about wars and how he would have love to take part in the same was horrifying, but how beautifully Scarlett's character explained to him about why war is a not good idea was something I really admired.It might seem like that conversation went into vein because the boy didn't agreed with her during the conversation. But the impact of the conversation on the overall development of the boy was immense.Which at last resulted in the boy not wanting to be a part of the war at all."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,7/10,"Adolf: (to Jojo) Let me give you some really good advice. Be the rabbit. The humble bunny can outwit all of his enemies. He's brave, and sneaky, and strong. Be the rabbit.Honestly, I wasn't sure if it would work, but it does. Jojo Rabbit is the quintessential Taika Waititi film, and creates this phenomenal narrative for us. Give this film to any, literally any other director, and it could not work. Jojo Rabbit handles some seriously heavy and touchy topics very well, and actually keeps the usual overkill of politics at bay.Outstanding performances were delivered from Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant (side note, google this guy and note that a carbon copy of a bearded Cillian Murphy), obviously Taika Waititi himself. And seriously, this film brought out 3 unknown actors & actresses, and showed us that you don't need to be a well-known actor to steal the show. Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKensie, and Archie Yates are absolute gems, and truly bring this film to light. You will see those names a hell of a lot more in the future, I promise that.This is such an interesting story, and has such wit and humor, even in a dark time period. Particularly, Jojo Rabbit maintains a surprising sense of respect and honor for the actual historical events that it represents. Jojo Rabbit definitely deserved that Oscar (a first). I believe this film has solidified Taika's status as a director to reckon with, so keep an eye out for this ingenious and witty director's upcoming films.""Pat's Rotten Tomatoes"": 84%
""Watch This?"": Please Do!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 December 2019,8/10,"It's a very heart warming story of a young boy who is struggling with his identity in Nazi Germany. The film itself has a good depth of story. If you're coming into this expecting more comedy than drama, you may be disappointed. I personally feel the acting within the film leaves you admiring the cast, as they portray their characters well enough. This story has a heavy emphasis on love and identity. Almost every character in JoJo Rabbit has some element of trying to understand themselves in their day-to-day life, which adds an element of realism to the film. I feel there are good lessons in the film that warrant watching it. The movie is also a tear-jerker. I recommend recognizing that before going in. If you're watching this movie for a lot of laughs, you may find yourself underwhelmed though there is some comedic parts to it, but the underlying moral principles and self-actualization of each character is profoundly demonstrated. Definitely a movie for those who love a good story with character depth."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is rare alchemy, it turns tragedy and historical horror into a sweet story of humanity, love, acceptance and optimism. Hats off, Taika Waititi."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,4/10,"Started an account just to warn others. Avoid at all costs. My ticket was free and my companion's was $12 and I feel totally, totally robbed. No plot, no point. I'm drinking straight whiskey now to try and get it out of my brain. I noticed some gen y and millennials laughing at some of the mindless slapstick nonsense aspects, but if your IQ is average or above take a comfy pillow. Yawn ... someone told me it was satire ... which begs the question: ""Of what?!"" ... the audience, perhaps. 4 stars is generous."
JOJO RABBIT,2 January 2020,10/10,So much fun with all the family. The first 7mins you are clintching the arm rest not wondering which direction the movie is going in but as soon as young Yorki enters it is barrells of laughs.I love how serious the true meanings of the movie are through out. Especially with Scarlett's character.Sit back and enjoy 😊
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,1/10,"America didnt win the war. USSR did. Otherwise, the movie was great."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,8/10,An interesting take on World War II but missing the warm comedy of Wilderpeople.
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"A tragic (dark) comedy, with un underlying positive message.The movie starts off in a very humorous but slightly silly fashion. The beginning jokes made me experience a feeling of unease. After the main character Johannes practises his German greeting with Adolf himself, I quickly realized that Johannes isn't only adorable but also portraits a completly believable human being. He just lives in a bizarre world. As the movie progresses the story becomes deeper and the complexity of the war unfolds itself. As Johannes finds the hidden girl living in their attic, his own truth about the world slowly starts to crumble. In the private conversations these two kids have, I saw the brilliance of both young actors. They managed to take my breath more than once. Both with laughs and with tears. Any kind of 'cheap' feeling I might have had during the first ten minutes now faded. I am completely captured by the story. The many laughable moments are perfectly balanced with the overall tragedy. In the for me most memorable scene Rosie, Johannes mother, dances her sons anger and pain away as they talk about his father who left home. In this scene Scarlett Johansson demonstrates a variety of acting skills which made me admire her even more. Altough my sadness grew as the movie came closer to its ending. The strength and positive attitude of pretty much all main characters can't stop me from feeling good. It is a movie worth debating. But mostly felt like a little piece of art."
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is not only hysterical, but it also has high emotional impact. The perspective of a brainwashed child in nazi Germany is something we've never seen before and it is genius as a satirical perspective. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time, and I cried for a good 10 minutes when the credits rolled. This movie should not be interpreted as offensive and as if it is making light of nazism. Its purpose is to provoke thought about empathy and independent thinking and doing what's right. Everything Taika Waititi touches is my favorite thing, so enjoy!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 January 2020,10/10,"Having been excited to see this movie since that very first trailer on YouTube, I could not wait to see it. Now most of us know that expectation and reality rarely truly match up. Well on this occasion I can actually say that for me, my expectations were totally surpassed!The casting, script and mood of the movie were just perfect. I honestly could not find any fault with the film other than I wish it had lasted longer! I was taken on a journey of hilarity, more hilarity, action and some tears.If I see no other new film this year I will be satisfied."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,10/10,This movie touches on some sensitive topics in a really comedic way. Though I can't vouch for it's ability to handle the topic of antisemitism carefully (as I myself am not Jewish) but as far as I can tell it does it's best to balance comedy with the reality of Nazi Germany. It's my personal choice for movie of the year among all the films that I saw in 2019.
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,10/10,"Lets start by praising the increible performance by Scarlett Johanson, where she has to play several roles inside the same movie as a mother, absent father and a nazi war criminal.
The movie keeps your attention with a sort of modern comedy while giving you a different perspective of WWII.
The movie has two parts, in which you first see a little nazi boy's perspective and then his little bubble pops showing the awful truth about the war and how it affects his way to see the world.A true work of art"
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,10/10,"This is an incredible comedy, drama and satire. Light film about a big tragedy. Amazing play of children. Incredible dialogues about the Jews and the Nazis. I cried and laughed. In young children, huge and important thoughts were laid. This film is the right and one of the best benefits for pupils. Of course this film deserves an Oscar."
JOJO RABBIT,15 January 2020,8/10,"A satire film about Nazi's and the holocaust is a very difficult thing to do and I can definitely see people hating this film or avoiding it because of the subject matter. However you would be missing out on an incredibly funny and emotional story.
Well acted and well written. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.Please don't be afraid of this film. Believe me. You will be missing out if you do!"
JOJO RABBIT,16 January 2020,1/10,"I fell asleep after 30 minutes of watching this movie in the cinema, ive never fallen asleep in the cinema before, yay."
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,10/10,"A veteran of both desert wars and a professional soldier (retired) I can certify that the critics of this movie know nothing.
This movie capture perfectly war and its real horror. Bood and explosions are just wars currency and frankly, I've had worse paydays.The true cost is measured in lost lives and lost human potential.The architects of the nonsense are always the same clowns - turning people against one another for their own fortune.This movie not only nails this message but gives us a glimpse of something better - a triumph of human nature, of kindness - the only thing which matters after all.Go go rabbit!"
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,2/10,"Contrary to popular opinion, I don't see anything cute, sweet, or funny about Nazism, even spun as a childhood fantasy love story. I'm pretty much aligned with Joe Morgenstern of WSJ on this one."
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,10/10,"As a Jew who grew up hearing stories of murdered relatives by Nazis, and then myself  from my homeland, I can appreciate a little humor about one of the darkest chapters in humanity."
JOJO RABBIT,1 July 2020,10/10,"Best film I've ever watched. It makes you want to cry and them Rebel Wilson comes in and lightens the mood by making you laugh your head off. Incredible, deserves more awards."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2021,9/10,Fantastic film. watching the roughest and a tragic story from the eyes of child with his beautiful sight of view
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,1/10,"I´ve watched it and had to fight with myself that I don´t fall asleep. The movie is not funny nor I can´t take it serious. The acting is bad, the Hitler figure is the worst.
Seriously. This might be US humor or something, but I guess for normal people it´s just boring a.f."
JOJO RABBIT,27 March 2020,2/10,"Not satirical or witty enough to be funny.
Not serious or immersive enough to be emotional."
JOJO RABBIT,7 February 2020,8/10,"With all the current political trends in movie industry. A movie like this becomes such a fresh air. I suppose the easily offended generation will be hating on this movie, and I'd love to see a recording of their reactions."
JOJO RABBIT,5 April 2020,1/10,I don't find it funny or any entertaining .. and also this movie is for kids ..
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,10/10,"There's nothing superflous in this movie. From my perspective, the humanism idea has never been depicted so bright and simple. Of course, it's a kind of a cheat code for producers to cast kids, cuz they always act better than adults, it's easier to sympathize them etc. It's a notorious trick, but here it's absolutely justified: there is no other significant way to depict the whole stupidity of agression, fanatism, misconceptions than to show a child with a grenade running towards death with an idol in his brain. The idea is rigidly placed in your brain with just a few tools: childhood, nazism and really dark satire on all those Trumps, Putins, Thunbergs sitting in our brains and dictating us to hate each other for their benefit.I would also like to highlight Sam Rockwell's captain Klenzendorf (Strainer). He is not just a funny guy, emboding the despair of german military and folk. He is the version of the boy's future: injured, disappointed and dead. Quite symbolic that he is the one who saves the boy and the girl from execution* without trying to save himself. He was sure that Gestapo will reveal his bluff and definitely did not want to be tortured by soviets. Still, he saves the boy who broke his career and a jewish girl. The hell he suffered made him get rid of his inner idols. I hope this movie will affect the audience the same way his war efforts affected him.* By the way, the Red army seldom killed captured germans (both militia and soldiers), we did that only in exceptional cases like a breakthrough. Moreover, the Red army saved civilians in Berlin underground inundated on Hitler's order. Most captives were sent to Syberia after the Nuremberg trials (communists forced the allies to conduct them, btw). I don't want to justify the crimes of soviets (or any other country which allowed this war) conducted during and before this war, but, really, there's no need to demonize russians, especially in this movie. From the one side this movie postulates ""peace, love, understanding"", on the other ""russians kill civilians"". No, we don't. If we want to kill someone, we start with ourselves in Gulags or KGB basements."
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,9/10,"Ok, I thought this would be my style of offbeat humor and it definitely is. I didn't expect, however, the depth, emotion and tenderness along with the humor.
The beginning was the quirky silliness I expected (I love it but also realize not everyone does). Then, well let's avoid spoilers and just say things got complicated.And that's when JoJo went from absurdist comedy (Think Life of Brian only with Hitler) to something more like a Chaplin comedy, the kind that has who laughing one moment and crying the next.
I loved the look and feel of it. Sometimes it has a cartoon feel about it but the characters are three dimensional, full of emotion.This could have been silly, could have been hideously offensive but some how Waititi and cast pulled it all together. I realize it won't work for everyone, the whole idea of anything funny with nazis is may be intolerable for some people, and that's reasonable.
But if your sense of humor is a little unconventional, this is a must see."
JOJO RABBIT,8 March 2020,10/10,This film was well written with good character progression. A fun story of a kid growing up towards the end of world war 2 in Nazi Germany.
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,10/10,"Let me start with saying that this movie is quite historical correct and is filmed completly from the mind of a young 10 year old boy that is very happy with his life so far. This boy is introctinated with Nazi propaganda, Hitler is the man he looks up to, even more, his imaginary friend is Hitler. Not the real one offcoarse, he is imaganary so Hitler his behaviour is a mix between the real one and a child.This gives the movie an intresting start because children were indeed indroctinated, they went into the Hitler Jugend and the movie doesn't alter that from a historical point of view. The other characters behave not like you would expect but also again from how the boy sees it.As the movie progresses he is forced to start to doubt everything he believes and tries to comprehend as he is confronted with al the terrors at the end of a war, sometimes it's a bit funny, sometimes you will be shocked.The movie goes over a lot of topics that are very risky to touch: manipulating children with the Hitlerjugend, using and sacrificing children in a war that was already lost (the defense of Berlin was in fact for the largest part the Hitlerjugend), how the Nazi portrayed Jews and actually believed it next to other more usual topics you would expect.In one scene where bullets are flying trough the sky and the boy is confused as he doesn't comprehend anything he looks at 2 german soldiers that are fighting dressed in funny clothes decorated with pink triangles what confuses him even more.The movie will not tell you what that ment because the boy will never understand it in his life but neither will most viewers do. In case you wonder what the fuss is about the pink triangle, it was given under article 175 that sended you off to a concentration camp where you would die a lot faster then if you were given a star of david. Article 175 stayed in effect, survivors of concentration camps were send of to prison after the war, Germany first reconized this in 2002, in 2018 the German president asked for forgiveniss for this ""suffering and injustice"".But from the perspective of this child, he only sees funny clothes, pink triangles and that it has something to do with the Nazi's. The rest of the story will be somehting for a future generation, that is how deep this movie actualy goes.Yet the movie has it funny moments because the mind of a child under extreme pressure behaves not like you would expect.
Not everyone will see the movie as I do, some will see it as satire and more comedy. Others will find it a very strange movie, that is something you will have to find out for yourself."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,3/10,"Not what i expected after i saw the trailer. To me it seems the trailer had all of the funny bits in it, i lost interest in the movie around the half way mark."
JOJO RABBIT,22 February 2020,10/10,"I was quite sceptical turning this movie on. After first five minutes, I was finding it amusing. Half a way to the movie not only fun to watch, but also masterly execuded, smart and touching. This movie is a comefy/drama masterpiece which deserves an attention."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,3/10,Totally overrated. Nothing more than others dark comedy movie. Made hype .. Total boring.Only kudos to roman griiffin. A very talented kid. Just wonders stuck in boring storyline
JOJO RABBIT,10 May 2021,1/10,"If you go into this expecting revelations of Nazi Germany, you'll be terribly disappointed with a super slow and boring love story of a 10 year old. There's nothing to learn in this movie, you don't achieve anything by watching 2 hours of this. You're better off playing one of the Wolfenstein games which provide a 20x return of fun and gripping story."
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,8/10,"I must say that it was not of my favorites, but it's nice and I really liked it."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,10/10,"I'm sure you look at the title of my review and think - did this guy get the wrong end of the stick while watching this? I say with full confidence that this movie is a masterpiece of satire, romance and drama.So where to begin? The characters crafted by director Taika Waititi, who both directs and stars in this feature, also know for his work with ""what we do in the shadows,"" are truly multidimensional and have many angle to be viewed and interpreted even with some of the more minor roles having a complex background with the exception to some. This is best seen with the character of Jojo, played by Roman Davis, who is our lead and shows development throughout, he moves from avid Hitler fanatic, who imagines Hitler to be his best friend to a sympathiser of Jews who protects his new friend hiding from persecution at all costs. Other noteable examples include: Elsa, played by Thomasin McKenzie, acting perfectly and masterfully as the Jew hiding from persecution showing development as she opens up to the character Jojo and also telling him of her backstory. Scarlett Johansson's Rosie, anti-nazi mother struggling to raise her child without the state's influence, Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf who becomes dis-infatuated with his cause and spoiler: sacrifices himself to save Jojo by the end of the movie, Taika Waititi's portrayal of Cowardly Hitler desperate for the admiration of Jojo. All the characters listed have depth and do show comedic elements throughout.Plot - the plot is simple Jojo is a member of the Hitler youth who has an imaginary friend: Hitler, he injuries himself with a grenade and is sent home. After he returns home he find that his mother is against the war and keeping a Jew in the walls of their home, he befriends the girl, Elsa, and he develops as a character.
-spoilers for remainder of plot -
The Gestapo visit his house and search it, for what we are not completely sure, Elsa comes out of hiding and poses as Jojo's sister Inga, who had died, she barely passes as his sister. Later Jojo goes out and finds that his mother has been hanged for distributing propaganda for the allies against the Germans. Jojo returns home and attempts to kill Elsa but ultimately fails. Soon thereafter the war comes to his town and the Americans and Soviets take the town. Jojo is rounded up with the other Nazis due to him earring the cap and jacket, the Captain, Klenzendorf, saves Jojo by taking the uniform from him and berating him as a Jew. As to get him kicked out of the line up where the Soviets executed Germans. He is promptly shot after this. Jojo returns home shortly after this to lie to Elsa about who won the war and after reviewing his book, ""yoo-hoo Jude,"" he realises that he has to let her go. He confesses his love for her and walks her outside after kicking Hitler out of a window. They proceed to dance in the streets to a German rendition of Bowie's Heroes.So the plot... Surprisingly good, when written down it seems far too complex so I had to simplify a bit but not too simple. With the characters and comedy the plot is nothing short of a masterpiece.I must now admit the title is misleading, the satire is completely true as the nature of the comedy is that of a satire but it is a story not of love in the sense of romance unless you count Jojo's unrequited love with Elsa but rather the brotherly and sisterly love developed throughout as Jojo begins to see Jews as people and not monsters and as Elsa realises that he is not a Nazi but a brainwashed child, infatuated with a cause.The cinematography in the movie is tremendous and the camera shots are magnificent using close-ups, establishing shots and push/pull shots with horror like scenes. The soundtrack is composed with mostly German covers of famous songs.In conclusion, Jojo Rabbit is a masterpiece of a movie that I would recommend to fans of satire and comedy as a whole. 10/10"
JOJO RABBIT,15 March 2020,10/10,"Sports events were cancelled, so just browsing movie titles and thought, why not Jojo Rabbit...nominated for best picture, etc...and from the very first moment, I was hooked. The premise, the acting, the script, the plot, the cinematography...so unexpected, since I really knew nothing about the film, a total surprise. Think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. But, I will say...you would have to like ""quirky"" to really enjoy it!"
JOJO RABBIT,28 March 2020,9/10,"For some strange reason, I still think of this movie. I've known of Taika for at least 2 years, and I was waiting this movie, because the premise was... really interesting and funny. And it was my grand surprise, when it was amazing.
This movie made me laugh, chuckle and in no moment I was bored, I was trapped by the plot and how Jojo grows, as he is a child man. The thoughts of the third reich German people is awful, yet Taika also makes it funny, and humanize them. And now that I talked about how the movie was really funny, let me tell you, how moving, how shocking it was.
How Jojo can see away of his blind fanaticism, and grows to see that the nazi ways is not the right way, and starts connecting with the jew girl, when he was starting to see Hitler as the evil man he is, thanks to his mother, just when hi is starting to see that, everything goes wrong, not gonna say what happens, but, it shocked me, and while the room was filled with tears, I was in absolute shock, nothing afterwards that specific scene, was funny, I got out wanting to go in again, which... I did, and I couldn't think of anything better than, damn, and everytime I watched it, got me astonished, wordless, with a knod in my throat.
All of this movie is awesome, and great."
JOJO RABBIT,28 March 2020,10/10,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it is not a comedy. Do not watch this movie and expect to be busting a gut with laughter. Taiki Watiti as Hitler lightens the seriousness of the subject and brings some well placed balance to the film. There are unexpected turns, it's easy to follow, and the music is well done. I could not believe it was rated PG-13. Language and subject matter seemed to warrant a higher rating, yes it has a child as the main character, but I would suggest parents give it a watch before letting children under 18 watch this. Critically speaking, it's an amazing satire that delivers a compelling message in regards to the blind nationalism."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,9/10,"We all understand how terrifying fascism is. We have already seen so many films in the genre «Good guys win bad Nazis». We have also seen films where residents of Hitler's Germany, include children, looks from the truly worse sides of cults their country. But in my experience, no one had ever seen in fascism and war something...from a game. For something like that, I'll be right to a film «La Vita e bella» (1997). Nazis from the film «Jojo Rabbit» are just grown-up kids, who still play shooters. Adults have no idea how to live in this crazy world, so everyone plays in games and sacrifice part of mind, so they doesn't want all of them in the most brave moments.Unfortunately, kids should back down from their fantasies and grow up because of childish adults around them. But creators claims that if children will free to love and dance, all will be good for them.The director of «Jojo Rabbir» Taika Waititi makes us laugh by showing fascism like an absurd idea, in which Hitler without any problems can be an imaginary friend, which imagine many children as clown or fairy creature. Laughing is a key to stop wars, because it doesn't make yourself hatred against other. This tactful mixing laughing with touchy tragedy let you be so loveful to this world as much as this film.A few words about production. The cast is amazing, kids are sweetie and extremely talented under the carry of genius adults. Also I had never seen so pretty color palette in films about war. I don't think that script is really adaptive, like it was named by Oscar's academics, but award is absolutely deserved. I admire Taika Waititi, who for 7 hardworking years from unknown New Zeeland director had become a popular creator."
JOJO RABBIT,13 April 2020,10/10,"The title, the cover, and the reviews nearly made me stray, but I'm glad I rented this movie! I can see this being a classic! I haven't seen a movie this good in ages! Watch it now! Also, the ending is awesome!"
JOJO RABBIT,1 April 2020,10/10,"Jojo Rabbit is that one rare and a peerless movie that succeeds on almost every emotional level, where each character, scene, costume, and joke firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings. Keeping aside all the technical aspects, what really had an impact was that every scene had something new for me to learn and apply that in my life. There were so many things that I could relate to.The drawing scene in the end particularly, where the camera never leaves their faces, show how much they can convey with just a drawing, nothing but their eyelids, the flashing tension of neck muscles, and a barely cracking voice emphasizing the importance of freedom.One such thing from the movie which moved me apart was: While Jojo's mum was around everything she said didn't make sense and when she dies everything makes sense and he happens to do and believe whatever she says, even things like dancing for freedom which he never liked doing. Which reminds me of things which we all have experienced in our lives is that ""You will realize the value of someone only when that someone is away from you""All in all for me, Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit's every frame felt like a painting worth sitting in."
JOJO RABBIT,4 April 2020,1/10,"Very disappointed to be watching this after seeing some good reviews, it's really not reflective of the movie. If I tunes issued refunds I would want my money back for renting this."
JOJO RABBIT,4 August 2020,10/10,"It's really beautiful you know...the art of laughing,,the art of emotion, everything shown in this flim is a art. It's really a masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,23 April 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies i have to see. This filme have everything; i laughed and cried. The perfect composition, the way that the creator represented a delicate event with an inocent and good humor, is awesome! Also i can say that is a very good cast. The adaptation of a book was profound and creative. This story is very emotive, teaching us in a different way the situation in which it is set."
JOJO RABBIT,26 July 2020,8/10,"Now usually I don't notice acting in films cause usually it's good but when I can tell that acting is good it usually means the acting is phenomenal and that is exactly what I'm talking about in this review. The child actors were amazing every line was delivered smoothly and the dialogue never felt lengthy, stretched out or feel like it did not flow well. The sets were great in this film. From the town to jojos house the sets look great. Costumes are accurate and look authentic. The story line is good and it fairly easy to pick apart what's the beginning of the film the middle and the end which is always good. The comedy was great and the nazi and Jew jokes are kinda offensive but no to offensive that it's just not funny. Now if I'm gonna talk about the reason why this gets 8 stars and the dumb stuff in this movie there are gonna be some spoilers so I will tell when the spoilers will start and they start now. (SPOILER ALERT) So near the end of the movie jojo tells Elsa that the Germans won the war but why would he do that!? At this point in the film jojo is anti nazi because of Elsa and he learns that the Jews are not bad. Now I know this was the way it was in the book but for the film it makes no sense for the story or jojos character. Now onto the stuff I like by the way still spoilers. So the film ends with jojo and Elsa dancing which is a perfect call back to what jojos mother (Scarlett Johansson)was saying how when Germany loses the war they must celebrate and dance (idk man I just thought that was clever! lol) and when jojo meets with imaginary Adolf Hitler after Hitler kills himself he has a bullet hole in his head which is a nice touch (SPOILERS OVER) at the end of the day jojo rabbit is a heartwarming and ultimately wholesome movie with dark source material so I recommend it to any fans of comedies, dramas, or WW2 movies"
JOJO RABBIT,3 May 2020,,"I had high hopes for this movie but maybe that's why the disappointment was so big.
It's not a bad movie.... Bay it's just not funny enough, not surprising enough ... Meaning not worth the time."
JOJO RABBIT,4 May 2020,1/10,IT's not funny just stupid. Don't bother with it go for a walk.
JOJO RABBIT,10 May 2020,9/10,"Synopsis : Looking like 1945, in the last stages of world war II, 'Jojo Betzler' a ten year old kid joins the Deutsches( German) Jungvolk. He is an innocent boy but heavily indoctrinated with the Nazi ideals. Having small age, he is totally childish. We discover that Jojo is very kind hearted person,So, at the first stage of the movie,refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his killer instinct.Also, a stubborn person, he returns to prove his bravery( stealing a stielhandgranate and throwing it without supervision.)
In the middle stage of the movie, we see that Jojo discovers that his single mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic.Aided only by his imaginary friend--Adolf Hitler--Jojo must confront his blind nationalism as world war II continues to rage on. Though, Child Jojo continues to speak that girl, doing his best to uncover her ""Jew secrets"". We see that Jojo's mother character in this movie is totally modern,Independent thinker, a complete motherhood.
Last stage, the war just ended up,with brutal state.Germans are not be outdone.They fought with their lives. There is a big point , writer wants to say that, Peace is very important , Love is very important.
A marvelous comedy-drama film by the master,oscar awarded director, Taika Waititi, based on Christine Leunen's book 'Caging Skies' with his finest team. The film is amazing in all aspects like acting,music,dialogue. If you like historical drama or like anything, you will love this without question."
JOJO RABBIT,5 June 2020,9/10,"I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed every bit of it, This movie is worth your time."
JOJO RABBIT,24 June 2020,10/10,"JoJo Rabbit is probably one of the best films I have had the pleasure of viewing in a while.Taika Waititi has taken a risky subject matter and injected his polished storytelling, satire and slapstick. Merged with beautiful narrative techniques and a truly compelling storyline with unexpected twists. Those shoes!A genuine heartfelt film about growing up indoctrinated in to something and learning to change. Gorgeous film with a tear churning yet brilliant ending.10/10"
JOJO RABBIT,24 June 2020,9/10,"The movie is wonderful in its visuals, story and comedy. The actors are amazing. Jojo Rabbit is extremely clever in its use of suspense, sometimes even coming to Tarantino heights. This combined with a very serious theme approached from the perspective of a child makes for one of the funniest movies I've seen all year."
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,8/10,"I loved it, especially the ending. It was funny, heartfelt and with plenty to say. Massive respect to Taika Waititi"
JOJO RABBIT,24 July 2020,10/10,"A charming story from the point of view of a child in WW2 whose imaginary friend is Hitler. I had high expectations after seeing the trailer and being a fan of the works of many of the people behind the movie, but was still pleasantly surprised. The characters are all played really well; my favourite being Scarlet's character as the mom. She is so endearing and just the kind of mother you'd want to be/have. Very well written characters and story. Made me laugh and cry. Definitely a movie to watch multiple times."
JOJO RABBIT,4 August 2020,10/10,I can't believe this film only received a 7.9 rating. It deserves a 10. It had such feeling and all the actors were perfect in their roles.
JOJO RABBIT,11 August 2020,7/10,"Hollywood had the balls to create a movie about an Aryan-German kid who's volunteering in a Hitler youth group and I gotta say, Taika Watiti pulled it off as the director and also for starring as ""Hitler"" in this movie who's a figment of imagination for our lead character. The boy's relationship with a Jewish girl was displayed beautifully, they both acted well and were the heart of the movie. Another good factor about the movie is Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell, their characters have depth and unfortunately they don't have a happy ending which is the most tragic part of the movie.
Overall it's a good movie, a few flaws but still good."
JOJO RABBIT,14 August 2020,8/10,"Really likeable characters and some great writing. Favourite quote is from Scarlett Johansson's character when she explains what it means to be a women and says learning to ""trust without fear"""
JOJO RABBIT,7 March 2020,10/10,There is no other word for it - just brilliant! Takes you from laughter to brokenheartedness and the whole gamut of emotions.
JOJO RABBIT,12 September 2020,2/10,"I love Sam Rockwell and wanted to love this movie, but it relishes itself in stereotypes. I'm so confused to all the hoopla it recieved, but only slightly as the set this movie was made for its so tone deaf to the realities of the world that it actual celebrates their privilege in itself."
JOJO RABBIT,18 May 2021,10/10,Great humour with a gut wrenching twist. Really well directed.
JOJO RABBIT,1 October 2020,10/10,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I was instantly intrigued. The style appeared to be reminiscent of a Wes Anderson film. Taika Waititi pulled it off beautifully. Bright saturated colors, symmetrical composition, and a quirky comedic expression with a sinister undertone. But despite the beauty of the film making style, what really drew me in was the topic they chose to draw from. Nazi Germany through the perspective of a German child. Many films have been afraid to touch on the topic of Nazi Germany. And for good reason! Not everyone can work with the weight of this topic. But in Jo Jo rabbit, it somehow felt right. And they did it through the art of comedy. The film was a breath of fresh air in a theme that is presented so often in just one perspective."
JOJO RABBIT,26 September 2020,10/10,Got to watch a classy stuff after long time. Great work.
JOJO RABBIT,27 September 2020,10/10,"This is by far one of the best films I have seen in my 55 years on this earth, and it could not have at a better time the cast were terrific, comical and tragical all at once. But more importantly it was a reminder of the tragical mistakes a society can make in desperate times. Because when society begins believing the absurdities its being told by politicians, then they will also commit atrocities as well. History is there for us to learn from. Therefore be diligent and be vigellant of what you are being told by hate groups such as the BLM, they are just flipping the script with their propaganda. Hatred is Hatred and comes in different cokors and ignorance doesn't discriminate."
JOJO RABBIT,27 September 2020,10/10,"I was completely and pleasantly taken aback by this film. Scarlet Johansen at her absolute finest. She has truly matured into a timeless artist. The whole cast together make a fantastic connection with no lulls or even look-away-to-grab-some-popcorn moments. The scenery and cinematography... for lack of an original phrase, but for one that describes it accurately, is HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL! And I don't think it would be overly dramatic to say Jojo Rabbit is a genius's work. Nazi Germany, the tragedy of war, racism and the unlikely friendship that evolves out of survival, the innocence of youth and the notion that love and goodness conquer... Never before have I seen such juxtaposition on screen that not only works all the way through but drives the point home with honesty and so the audience is not left with anything unfelt. I laughed, I wept, I questioned and I learned a bit. What a magnificent way to memorialize a period in history which is becoming semi-extinct to future generations. If this doesn't get the kids asking questions, well then, you've got some density to penetrate. I would even consider it appropriate for the pre-teen albeit there are some parts of strong language and violence (necessary for this picture and done in pure taste). You'll probably wish to watch it again and maybe again to absorb it all, which you'll want to. And then you'll watch it whenever it comes on, like a good classic, because it's not one of those movies of truth that is too difficult to see more than once. Do yourself a service and just watch the darn thing."
JOJO RABBIT,4 October 2020,10/10,Should got the oscar for best movie! amazing screenplay! outstanding cinematography!
JOJO RABBIT,8 October 2020,10/10,The warmest film about the coldes time in history.
JOJO RABBIT,1 December 2020,8/10,"This film is a quirky twist on a hitler fanatic kid. There is some crude humor, loads of violence, but so much of fun and laughter along. Not to forget, some tears to. It really focusses on how the kid's mind works at that time, his friendship with a jewish girl and his endearing relationship with his mumma. It is cute!
I've got nothing else to say, just go watch it!"
JOJO RABBIT,15 November 2020,10/10,"It's one of those movies that, once you finish, you want to experience again. This was kinda surprising to me. I was expecting a comedic satire of WWII, but it ended up being more than that. It's funny, sad, heartwarming and heartbreaking. I totally recommend you watching this film. It's a masterpiece!"
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2020,9/10,"It's a masterpiece to be seen. The movie never bores you and always connects you to your seat. Most jokes are simple but really funny and well thought out. Along with its jokes, the movie teaches us what true love is, making us question our prejudices and how true our ideals actually are. But even though the movie was beautiful, the ending was really simple; I personally would like to see an after-credit scene where they both set up a home together, had a wife, husband and children. But other than that, I think it's a movie that should be watched."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2020,10/10,"Never commented on any movie in my life...but it forced me to....The best movie i have seen in my life, it made me laugh ...made me cry ...i would highly recommend this movie....everything was inch perfect ..."
JOJO RABBIT,13 January 2021,10/10,"This movie has everything a comedy should have, form constant funny one liners to hilarious long running jokes. The story cycles from funny light heart jokes to deep though moment. You should absolutely go watch it for the amazing preformances from actors Roman Griffin Davis, Archie Yates and sam rockwell. Its a great movie and it does not dissapoint"
JOJO RABBIT,16 May 2021,8/10,"It's worth it of watching. You will cry and laugh and have a good time, but at the end after the movie, you're gonna stop to think about what happened. The true story... it makes you reflect and between fall for the life we are able to have today."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2021,9/10,Its great its fantastic it has a very wel made story and some very dark scenes you dont expact but its worth to be watched for me its a 9 becauge i need more captain K
JOJO RABBIT,2 April 2021,10/10,"I think that this film could become a cult comedy...All I can say is that I can consider this film, my favourite film, without doubts!"
JOJO RABBIT,8 May 2021,10/10,I thought this was a children's movie about a rabbit but it wasn't. I have to say I was not disappointed.
JOJO RABBIT,29 May 2021,9/10,"The film Jojo Rabbit is not quite what people expect from a movie about WWII. Jojo is a 10 year old boy whose imaginary friend is none other than Adolf Hitler. Jojo Rabbit may be satirical in nature, but it still doesn't shy away from showing the ugly reality of war. This is where director Taika Waititi shows great balance in the film. There are many comedic parts to the movie, but there is still a seriousness throughout the whole film. Scenes of hanging bodies of those who oppose Hitler allow the audience to realize this isn't just a comedy about a 10 year old with Hitler for an imaginary friend. There is a greater and deeper message to the story; blind obedience leads to destruction of morality. Throughout the movie the audience is able to see the indoctrination of little kids into Hitler's Youth camps. These children are just told to follow the rules because the authority says so. Here, Waititi is able to explain through motion picture the true damage blind obedience to authority can have on an entire race and nation. This very truthful attitude displayed through the movie could very easily be the motivation for it as well. Unfortunately this blind obedience has occurred many times in this world, and continue to occur in socialist and communist countries. So Waititi could be using this movie as a warning to those who do what they're told just because they were told so by an authoritative figure. This motivation and attitude of Taika Waititi allows for Jojo Rabbit to portray truth, an ugly truth though. Many know truth can be beautiful and enlighten us about the joys of humanity, but truth can also be ugly and show the harshness and sinfulness of humanity. This is the truth Jojo Rabbit displays. It may not be a truth people want to know, but the truth about war, violence, Holocaust, and indoctrination is most definitely a truth needing to be shared.In light of the truth about war, Jojo Rabbit also shares an ugly truth about the loss of the dignity of the human person. When Jojo gains Elsa's help in writing his book on how to spot a Jew, the audience is able to see the absolute lack of dignity in the human person. This is something that was lost during the Holocaust as a whole race of humans were deemed subhuman. What is truly inspiring though about this film is how Jojo's attitude starts to shift. At the end of the movie he is seen helping Elsa and seeing her as a human instead of merely an ugly Jew he was taught to see her as. Even before Jojo starts to uphold the dignity of Elsa and other Jews, there is a glimmer of hope seen in Jojo's mother, Rosie. She is a true inspiration during the whole film, risking her life to try and put an end to the war, and even illegally hiding a Jewish girl in her home.Jojo Rabbit's target audience would be young adults and older. Children watching the movie could easily become confused by seeing Hitler as funny and a 'nice guy'. This doesn't make the movie a bad one though. For by portraying Hitler in this way, it gives the audience an idea of what children, and most likely adults, truly believed Hitler to be like. This tool is just one aspect of this very skillfully developed film. The storying telling is no doubt incredible, and the acting is very good as well."
JOJO RABBIT,25 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is almost like if Wes Anderson directed a WW2 movie.It has the sweet cute characters, the wacky zany characters , & outlandish scenarios.A truly sweet, moving film. & a decent action sequence to make it a trueWw2 movie."
JOJO RABBIT,5 March 2020,9/10,I feel like it is a film everybody who loves movies should see.... In my opinion it was almost perfect... my favorite movie of the year
JOJO RABBIT,13 November 2019,10/10,"This kinda reminded me of a Wes Anderson film with the background jokes, blink and you'll miss it. I watched it 2 times and still saw new things that cracked me up. I can't wait to own this so I can watch it many more times."
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,10/10,"Just amazing! Well written, well acted and an overall delight!
I laughed and I cried and I will go see it again!"
JOJO RABBIT,23 May 2020,1/10,"Okay I have to admit, I only managed 30 minutes, which is impressive considering I'm someone who hates when people give up on movies. However, the comedy was way too forced, not funny in the slightest and just really stupid and weird. How this is rated is highly is beyond me."
JOJO RABBIT,22 June 2020,10/10,Possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen so far!
JOJO RABBIT,24 December 2019,10/10,"So much history, so much pain, still such an unimaginable horrific event but all credit to Watiti for handling this story with such grace and thoughtful insight. Funny, heartbreaking, witty, clever, insightful, intelligent, beautifully cast, brilliantly performed and incredible attention to detail."
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2020,8/10,"Powerful. A call for change. A call for truth. The film starts in an uncomfortable place but blossoms into an breath of fresh, much needed air. I feel like I need to watch it a few more times to pick it all apart. Tears shot out of my face at the end..."
JOJO RABBIT,3 October 2019,10/10,"This is an amazing movie, it's not for everyone. It's a dark movie in parts and hilarious in the rest. It forces you to look at humanity at its best , worst and dumbest. A lot of people will not be able to get past the idea of Hitler but Taika does not paint a glorious picture of him, it's probably accurate as a Trump like buffoon spouting oddities and nonsense. The two young boys are amazing and smarter than most of the adults. The cast was wonderful in their roles playing it straight and making it that much more hilarious."
JOJO RABBIT,4 February 2020,10/10,I loved this movie from beginning to the very end. Every minute of it.
JOJO RABBIT,21 January 2020,9/10,"I watched Jojo Rabbit a couple of days ago. It was the last film in my Oscars Marathon (if that's even a thing!), and boy oh boy, was I blown away! It met my, already high, expectations, as I had been anxiously waiting for it since I watched the trailer. A perfectly ensemble cast where everyone shines from Scarlett Johansson to Sam Rockwell, Taiki Waititi and most of all Roman Griffin Davis (Jojo). Beautiful cinematography, shows a beautiful side of a small town of Germany in the darkest of times. It makes you laugh, cry and jump off your seat. A complete package. Go watch it while it's still in the cinemas."
JOJO RABBIT,2 May 2020,10/10,This is a film I was looking forward to but it completely exceeded my expectations. Was expecting a laugh from start to finish but what I got was a darkly funny film that really makes you think. A film that when the credits roll you are left in your own mind feeling both happy and sad and contemplating life. Critics that slate this are really so out of touch or just dead inside as this is a film that is so surprisingly deep and heartwarming that if you dont feel anything then you must be a robot.
JOJO RABBIT,8 September 2020,3/10,"In fact the only personified evil in this movie are Soviet soldiers. The evil is shown abstract, nobody means anything wrong.Yet this one is funny enough, interesting to watch, well made movie"
JOJO RABBIT,26 August 2020,3/10,Though it will be more realistic comedy and not that much parody of the nasizm.. Disrespect for all that suffered nasizm horror.. All in all very over-rated..
JOJO RABBIT,1 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing film. I enjoyed every minute of it. You laugh , have fun and at the same time you leave with a thousand thoughts in your head about serious matters.
Just go and watch it"
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,5/10,I did not like it at all. I do not think that people from all around the world get the movie and find it interesting.
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"You laugh and you cry... And you laugh and cry at the same time.. Even long after you left movie theater..
An amazing masterpiece swiftly taking viewer trough darkest pages of human history.
Dark, savory, funny as hell and oddly very deeply moving movie. A must see art peace...Actors, all as one.. Top act.. Scarlet Johanson with true act, and never would have tought that kids could play so good."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,9/10,"Funny, charming, and sweet. All characters are played brilliantly and is a refreshing take on a dark topic."
JOJO RABBIT,2 May 2021,8/10,"Heartwarming and at times, hilarious. I absolutely adore Yorkie, Jojo's best friend."
JOJO RABBIT,23 January 2020,10/10,"One of my new favourite movies of all time. I laughed, cried and laughed again. Such an original."
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2019,10/10,"I could list a thousand reasons to see this movie, but I'll keep it short and simple.
It's simply the most brilliant and charming movie I've seen in ages."
JOJO RABBIT,26 April 2020,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit is bold and risky: a satire in which a caricatured Adolf Hitler offers us some of the funniest moments; a heartbreaking, tender portrait of a mother's love for her son; a parody of the most destructive ideological forces that still threaten society."
JOJO RABBIT,12 December 2020,9/10,"I was stunned when I saw the whole movie and then i saw the academy win and nominations and now I think the speculations that academy has become a political platform to distinguish and award the movies. I personally think this is a null movie. No story, no such a high caliber acting and direction and still it not only got nominations but also a win too. this movie got purely, purely and totally purely biased nod not only from academy but also from golden globe as well. Seriously guys this movie is not credited on merit. Share your thoughts with me. I am still shocked."
JOJO RABBIT,10 January 2020,9/10,The trailers for this film showed a light zanny film with maybe a touch of heart. However the film pulls at the emotions way more than I anticipated. The slightly jarring feel of comedy Nazis quickly makes sense later in the film.
JOJO RABBIT,21 January 2020,10/10,I'm sure all those who dumped on this movie are singing a different tune now. Deserves the best picture nod. I don't think it will win considering the academy and it's bs politics. This is a movie about humanity in the most unlikely places. Some will like others are just ignorant and wishing it was a Michael Bay film
JOJO RABBIT,17 February 2020,9/10,Among the best poetic anti war films made. Congratulations.
JOJO RABBIT,16 December 2019,8/10,"Having seen the film and trying to weigh it up against the critics reviews they generally seem to be missing the point. Many say the film dances around the atrocities performed by the third reich, but this is a film about war seen through the eyes of a ten year old boy we're even told by the end he's ten and a half. Sure when you're that age you play with ""guns"" and run around with your friends shooting each other pretending to be soldiers and war is a game you play but by the end he realises there are consequences for these actions. Go see this film make up your own mind, I loved it and if you're anything like me you'll love it too.
Cheers."
JOJO RABBIT,9 September 2020,10/10,"One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. I am in love with acting, story, directing, and overall experience... definitelly worth watching over and over again..."
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,6/10,"The general theme of the film is quite touchy, but because of this low quality comedy I couldn't get inside it. For example I didn't like the hitler character, I know the general idea is to show him bad and stupid but I don't think it went well in this film in this way."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"Please watch it, it's hilarious in places, and also tragic and it will leave you an emotional wreck but in a good way. I'll watch it again with my kids, from 9 to 15 years old. The youngest might get scared at some point, but we will talk if over. I feel like it's really important for them to see and for us to talk about. It touched me deeply."
JOJO RABBIT,14 March 2020,1/10,"Not funny, maybe 2-3 times in whole movie... 1-2 times touching and thats it... Fall asleep few times while watching it.. it is really something around 4/10 but I gave one star to downgrade rating"
JOJO RABBIT,27 January 2020,,"I came out of this film and didn't stop thinking/talking about it for the next week. It was funny, moving, and even surprisingly tense. The performances were excellent from all involved. I did think Rosie's accent was kind of weird, but still a beautiful and affecting character.
I also loved how accessible the film was and that I could take my kids (10 & 13) who both enjoyed it and understood the absurdity.
I can't wait to watch it again (and Miss 13 has said the same!)"
JOJO RABBIT,11 May 2020,9/10,"So deeply sad in a comedy. Really it's a drama for Jo Jo.
Beautiful.
What a story."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,A moving movie that brings you from laughs to tears and back again. Wonderful casting and location. A must see.
JOJO RABBIT,1 November 2020,10/10,"The movie is amazingly moving and it does so in a very unique way leaving the viewers to laugh, cry, disgust, amazed all at once. Worth a watch."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"I didn't want to watch it because of some bad critics reviews, thank God I ignored them!It shows the absurd side of racism and how we're not born with those ideas but our nature is to help each other as one humanityThe war scene and the end are the best!Awesome song for the final sceneSure I could watch it a 2nd and 3rd time!"
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2021,10/10,"I rarely write reviews, but this instantly became one of my favorite films of all-time when I saw it in 2019. I will never forget the two times I saw it in theaters, watching it first with friends, and then with my future wife. We have watched it every year since, and we'll never tire of this beautiful and hilarious movie."
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,9/10,Such a sweet yet sad beautiful look into a horrible space in time. It's a reminder how a young heart can be so malleable toward evil with even the purest of intentions. A warning towards the future with reminders from the past. Bravo!
JOJO RABBIT,11 November 2020,9/10,"Ummm, this movie was actually really, REALLY good!... I'm in awe at Taika Waititi's ability to handle such incredibly difficult subject material with both sensitivity AND incredible, ridiculous humor. As our family watched this, we were laughing hysterically one moment and being incredibly moved with compassion and empathy the next. Again, and again, and again. It was pure genius. And beautiful. It reminded me a TON of ""Life is Beautiful"" in the way it effortlessly bounced between comedy and hard truth. Recommended for families with kids ages 13+, as long as they are able to handle a bit of commonplace foul language, and one very appropriate F-word toward the end. Some educational opportunities in there as well as we all learned a few things about the era that we didn't know. I'm rating it 9/10 on IMDB."
JOJO RABBIT,26 May 2020,5/10,"Very well acted and filmed. The score was good. My issue was the whole concept. I just can't find anything about this war and all these tungue in cheek jokes funny.It made me squirm. There was so much death and horror in world war 2, I don't feel it's okay to make jokes about it."
JOJO RABBIT,26 February 2020,10/10,"Funny, inspirational, great actings and photography"
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2020,9/10,"Jojo Rabbit is not a fair movie, it is very funny, but also very sad at times ... which makes it s great movie ! Really not ofren a movie Can be entertaining and make you wonder afterwards like this"
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2021,8/10,"Funny, tragic, beautiful. Waititi is a very talented guy. Great cast. Really enjoyed it."
JOJO RABBIT,21 February 2020,9/10,A subject that's difficult to tackle is given a treatment that makes it watchable . All the characters make this one of the best movies of the year. No spoilers. Just go watch it. You won't regret it !
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,9/10,"Live, hope, silliness, shoes, and tying the knot(not what you think)"
JOJO RABBIT,25 December 2019,9/10,For me this film is a total paradox. I have never laughed so hard in one scene and then cried like a baby in the next. It's unique. Go watch.
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,10/10,"Everything is organised perfectly! The comedy, the serious nature of the topic."
JOJO RABBIT,3 August 2020,6/10,"While yes this was a good movie, great storytelling, this is not the quirky comedy that was advertised. It started out funny but the further along in the movie it got a lot more serious and at times depressing. Don't get me wrong it's a great story but it just wasn't what I was lead to believe. If you haven't seen it and expect it to be a fun movie, change your expectations"
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,10/10,Wow. I can't recommend you get this movie in your eye holes enough.
JOJO RABBIT,22 November 2020,6/10,"Some good moments but not enough engages to hold one's interest to the end. It reminded me more of the Tin Drum ( which is really difficult to see) than other more recent films which have a child as the main character in a Nazi Germany setting but obviously much lighter in tone , not all of which works."
JOJO RABBIT,29 December 2020,10/10,This is one of the best films I've seen this year. I laughed and I cried. It is heart warming and heart breaking. The kids acting is superb
JOJO RABBIT,19 July 2020,1/10,DARK! Depressing. Unfunny. Unentertaining. Depressing.
JOJO RABBIT,1 September 2020,,":gasp: you are a nazi if you love this...oh and, ""Gone with the Wind!"""
JOJO RABBIT,26 November 2020,10/10,It's a fantastic blend of comedy whilst also burning to light some of the very real issues that ravaged Nazi Germany.Easily one of my top ten films of my life.
JOJO RABBIT,23 May 2020,10/10,"One of the best movie I've watched at the last years..
""Let everything happen to you. Beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.
Rilke"""
JOJO RABBIT,17 December 2019,10/10,"Critics who think this went too far are totally wrong, it went just far enough.It successfully lampoons the Nazi ideology and delivers a thought provoking film that delivers on a very emotional level.The whole cinema I saw the preview at appeared to enjoy it just as much my friends and I did."
JOJO RABBIT,4 December 2019,9/10,"If you haven't yet seen this movie, don't read anything that comes even close to spoiling the plot. It's so much more satisfying to be surprised. Cannot reccomend waiting for this to come out for home viewing. If you have the means, go see it in a theater. It's fantastic"
JOJO RABBIT,28 June 2020,10/10,"Why hate so much, when you see that red blooded flag, the svastica and all symbols related to German Nazi Regime? A movie only can just fall on ""drama""? Hell no! Let´s see..
All the movie occurs on the sight of a young boy: all the beauty and colour of ""sugar german"" and then pass in less than 2 hours of movie to the ""brutal and bitter taste of war"". Laught, surely... but mostly, sadness to see in this visionary tale by the mind of Waititi, the truth in many aspects of history. Such a great director, also... Adolf! (tremendous and happy one surprise to me..)
There are so many things in life to see and do, but without any doubt, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE, because has all the teatrical elements than a masterpiece need: color, music, laughts, sad moments, terror, truth and of course.. a surprisely well acted serious chraracter of Mrs. Johansson. Surely will be the trampoline for Jojo and his second best friend... such talent!!!!
Dont be afraid, dark comedy like this one, shows impecable (i.m.h.o.) as a whole panoramic review, the many faces of a german kid: goosebumps to saw historic elements like civilians (and kids) go to face their destiny in front of the Nasty Background of an Open War field. The final, all we knew (hope that can´t change at all)... just come and see what if JoJo fall as a prey of his own feelings: as a boy, or a soldier of a Hitlerjugend?
Chapeau... SEE IT!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 April 2020,10/10,"To the person who might read this.When you see the trailer you don't think it's that of a great movie (or maybe it was just me) and you'll think it's a comedy so you automatically think you're going to be watching a comedy movie but you're wrong. This movie it's very unique that there's no words to describe how good of a movie it is. l can't spoiler the movie but you're going to love it, hate it or like it because it will make you laugh even feel sad so go watch it"
JOJO RABBIT,13 June 2020,10/10,"It's as if Mel Brook, Wes Anderson, Hogan's Heroes, and Calvin & Hobbes and a strange, beautiful love child.The satire is one point and illustrates perfectly how dangerous evil is to enthusiastic children.The acting is spot-perfect.As Mel Brooks showed us so well, the best way to attack evil is to make it absurd with endless mockery."
JOJO RABBIT,12 March 2020,10/10,"The movie had me on every level... I laughed, cried, loved the music and the weird-funny characters. The cast is fantastic and I celebrate Waititis way of Story telling and cinematic shots."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"A brilliant film, excellent acting and script, a far more layered film than the critics suggest. Go see it."
JOJO RABBIT,19 October 2019,9/10,"Movie opinions are subjective by nature and Jojo Rabbit is a prime example of this. Technically it has some problems and it's fair to argue about the cartoonishness of the story, But... I loved it. It had me laughing out loud various times, is extremely entertaining to watch all the way through and left me with an all around great, optimistic feeling. This is especially noteworthy given the heavy topics this movie deals with. It's also impeccable timed, a great anti war, anti hate movie in a time when the world in many ways parallels the 1930s. Go watch, you won't regret it."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,9/10,Wow! Worth a watch! It's an emotional rollercoaster and the cast were unreal!
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,8/10,The atmosphere and the story telling is one of the best...and i didnt bored during the film
JOJO RABBIT,22 December 2019,10/10,All I have to say is this movie is great! 10min in and I'm in tears laughing my  off!
JOJO RABBIT,9 February 2020,10/10,Well wont say much but this movie is a One of a kind masterpiece. I laughed and i cried multiple Times.The cast was spotless and Sam Rockwell shined the brightest (huge fan of him) so that might be biased haha.I just really recommend every One to se it
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,"Upon watching I wasn't really sure what to expect. This is honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Funny, tragic and a punch of young love thrown in. From start to finish I honestly can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film. The young man that plays Jojo is brilliant and Sam Rockwell definitely delivers. Highly recommend this to all audiences."
JOJO RABBIT,9 September 2019,8/10,"Jojo Rabbit will divide critics into ; those who marvel at the latest , comedic , Golden Egg , produced by this goose , Taika Waititi and those that want to tear the goose apart , in an attempt to smear some gold , on their own ability to dissect and criticise . Every kid that walks away from this movie , wanting to be a better person , is a tiny step , to making the world a better place ( the goal of the movie ) Those critics who want to shut that down , before it starts , need to ask themselves "" why was everyone but me laughing ? "" Update 15/Sept Peoples Choice Award TIFF . Lesson... Never try to PAN (fry) a golden egg ! :-)"
JOJO RABBIT,21 December 2020,1/10,"Jojo Rabbit has to be the dumbest movie ever made and it's extremely offensive to Jews and Holocaust survivors. Taika Waititi the screenwriter and director also casts himself as an imaginary Hitler that a German child plays with lol. Who the hell would finacially back a satire about the holocasut with that insane premiss? The Hollywood extreme leftest liberals would, and they give this disrespectful snooze fest an Oscar for it's pathetic screenplay. Typical of liberals who are running the Academy of Arts and Sciences. You now earn Oscars for making an unwatchable film that's disrespectful to holocasut surviviors. My friends also had zero interest in it and turned it off after 20 minutes. Taika Waititi must be connected to some very rich Hollywood liberals to get financing for this stupidty. Waititit is the first director/screenwriter that if I meet him in the street I like to break both his kneecaps with a baseball bat for being so disrespectful to holocaust survivors and their families. What the hell is so funny about the Holocaust?"
JOJO RABBIT,13 July 2021,10/10,Its very emotional present of the war and what really happened there.
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,9/10,"SO GOOD! Charming, funny, satirical. Moonrise Kingdom meets the 3rd Reich. I want to see it again!"
JOJO RABBIT,7 August 2020,9/10,"This film had wonderfully rich sets and costumes, performances that are rich and detailed development. There is a moment that makes one gasp and feel very deeply, masterful story telling"
JOJO RABBIT,30 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best films of the year. Once you get over the fact that it outrageous that it is nazi satire, you get really involved and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster.
Certainly one I'll never forget."
JOJO RABBIT,2 February 2020,1/10,Hittler is a cute imaginary friend. Nazis are goofy and funny. Antisemitism is adorable and volatile as a teenager crush.
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,"Cinematic art at it finest.
A movie to remember, a very well balanced movie with a dark sense of humor and a underlying message that not all is evil.Trivia: modern police siren in the background, halfway the movie."
JOJO RABBIT,28 March 2020,1/10,"Bad and very silly, i didn't like at all.
.....Best regards"
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,10/10,"First of all - Sam Rockwell, we have been blessed, we do not deserve him.
Second of all - I COULD NOT EVEN I WAS SO SHOOK. I didn't cry until the end
Third of all - F off Hitler
Fourth of all - I loved it, one of the most incredible movies I think I have ever seen. It was so profound and beautiful and had such incredible messages. I was so moved, I laughed, I cried. Perfect. Period.
Fifth and final for now - I am so grateful to live in the same time as Taiki Waititi. We do not deserve him, he is a visionary!"
JOJO RABBIT,27 February 2020,10/10,"So often you see a trailer then you see the film and you realise that all the best bits are the ones that you've seen. This was my worry, the trailer was stunning. I'm so pleased that this film surpassed my expectations, it's a triumph! It's hilarious but gets dark and meaningful so subtly that you barely notice. I cannot recommend this film highly enough."
JOJO RABBIT,31 January 2020,2/10,"The only reason we didn't walk out of this was not to light the theater up for the audience. This was unbelievable garbage. How does this get made. Visually it's decent, and the only redeeming part of the movie was the interaction between Jojo and the Jewish girl.Even with that interaction which was occasionally good, that is no excuse for this ""film"". I don't write reviews, but I see it's nominated for a bunch of Academy awards? Is this funny because everybody is afraid to tell jokes anymore?Sigh, not funny, not endearing, unlikable characters. What more can I say about this, it'll get voted down lie every other negative review of this."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,"I was expecting a dark comedy, I wasn't expecting it to be so deep."
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,9/10,One of the most horrific times in modern history through the innocent eyes of a child is pure genius. It takes us on a journey through his naivety and blind devotion from inside the belly of beast to his realization that what he trained to believe was wrong. As he grows the tone of the film changes reflecting that change. Brilliant movie.
JOJO RABBIT,10 November 2019,9/10,"Truly marvelous performances, and a story worthy of your time, expertly spun. Very comedic, but not a comedy. Sort of a 'Hugo' meets 'The Diary of Anne Frank' as directed by Monty Python. (best I could come up with, hardly adequate). The critics just got this one wrong, perhaps because they fear praising a work of art with controversial images. Predicting three or more Oscar nominations."
JOJO RABBIT,24 January 2020,10/10,"Wow! Short but sweet review....just seen Jo jo rabbit...wow! What a brilliant refreshingly different film ,great casting and acting from all.... massive thumbs up for this very humorous original film.... highly recommend from a two monthly film buff ."
JOJO RABBIT,25 November 2020,10/10,Such an emotional rollercoaster. Great film. A good mixture of comedy and drama. A really emotinal ending
JOJO RABBIT,17 January 2020,7/10,"The message of the movie is advising the audience resist all kinds of stereotypes regarding different nations.
But... at the end authors showing unbelievably stupid scene - Russian soldiers a executing German captive solders (even ready to kill children just because of military uniform).
Seriously???
Such an obvious propagation of false judgment against Russian/Soviet people.
This is simply devaluating whole movie."
JOJO RABBIT,8 January 2020,10/10,"A wonderfully drawn film on becoming an adult/human, anti-war and anti-bigotry through reasonably dark humour. It's brave film that deserves a very wide audience."
JOJO RABBIT,19 December 2020,10/10,An achingly beautiful satire of how we view the world as children (and arguably as adults). Just watch it.
JOJO RABBIT,22 March 2020,8/10,"The film is set up during World War II. The concept for the film is simple where a young 10yrs old boy is influenced by a Hitler ruled Germany. He is an innocent boy who grows fond of Hitler because the everyone around him loves Hitler. He doesn't understand about what are Jews, he hates them but this grows into love when he finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. They develop a great relationship and also there is a great bond between jojo & his mum (scarlet Johanson) who is beautiful as always in the movie.All the character are perfect and funny in their roles. The story made laugh at the innocence but also made me cry in it's moments, It tries to hide the WAR but it also perfectly shows that the outbreak is still happening.Its a movie filled with emotions & love that what makes it a beautiful one to watch."
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,9/10,"I will certainly call this one of the best movie of 2019. Excellent adaptation done by Taika.
The movie goes through various emotions from beginning to end. Sometimes very funny especially when a ten year old boy imaginary friend is Hitler, at the some time very emotional. I will not give you any spoiler.
Everyone performance is the movie is brilliant especially by for young actor Roman Griffin Davis. Taika has done great job in writing and directing.The movie is a beautiful piece of art, so just watch it."
JOJO RABBIT,29 January 2020,1/10,"Terrible film. Just don't go.
It's a poor copy of Life is beautiful, just a try of an ironic view of the nazi tragedy.
Bad and exaggerated acting.
Scarlet Johansen terrible."
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2020,10/10,This film is perfect. It was great first time. It was magnificent second time. Faultless.
JOJO RABBIT,25 January 2020,1/10,"The movie is made by an american and you can feel that. Filled with cliches (which aren't objectively funny) and stereotypes.
I wanted to leave the theatre for about half a dozen times."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,9/10,"Great story, great acting and great message.Taika Waititi skirts the edge of such a sensitive topic with a different perspective. JoJo Rabbit is surprisingly palatable, laughable and a poignant reflection on a dark time in human history.A must see for any who want something more out of cinema."
JOJO RABBIT,10 February 2020,9/10,This was a brilliant film. I really recommend you watch this little gem if you haven't already. Not sure why but i had tears in my eyes at two points.
JOJO RABBIT,7 March 2020,10/10,This is a wonderful movie with themes never before expressed. Unfortunately the story arc requires the audience to let go of drama and watch characters play on the human stage.
JOJO RABBIT,22 January 2020,10/10,Don't miss out on this amazing film. Well done to all involved. I hope it wins every Oscar it is up for.
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,10/10,Love this movie. Great performance too.live the poem at the end too
JOJO RABBIT,12 January 2020,10/10,"Taika Waititi at his best.This film is an absolute triumph, it will make you laugh one scene and cry the next. Although at its heart it so satirical, it gives an excellent insight into the thinking within Nazi Germany.This film excellently walks the line between offence and satire, through the medium of comedy it demonstrates the successful use of propaganda in Nazi Germany while also maintains a story of love and redemption.There is never a dull moment in this film, you're either laughing or thinking.On top of this, the acting is superb, Roman Griffin Davis in particular superbly conveys the emotion of a child during this period and is complimented by Archie Yates who, dare I say it, played the funniest character I ever ever witnessed on the big screen.Overall, this film is a must see and will become a future classic."
JOJO RABBIT,20 March 2020,3/10,"It was slightly funny, but the accents were horrible! The only one who was passable was Scarlet. Not worth wasting 2 hours."
JOJO RABBIT,21 October 2019,10/10,"THIS is the movie we need right now. Filled with downright hilarious jokes (who knew German Shepherds could make such a great punchline?), a surprising and poignant screenplay, and three particularly phenomenal performances in Davis, Waititi, and Johansson, this not only met my expectations but further surpassed them on almost every level. The ensemble is filled with superb acting across the board, and each technical element from production design to costuming is unique yet precise. Additionally, there is a certain moment in the film that was absolutely bone-chilling in which one could feel each and every audience member's mood shift. The shift is executed so perfectly, largely as a result of Taika Waititi's brilliant direction and screenplay. Without his specific guidance in multiple aspects of the film, this could so easily have fallen apart. This is not a movie that should work it all... but damn it sure does. Be sure to update your Oscar predictions because this should go far!!"
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,1/10,"Courageous people can certainly find humor and irony in the most desperate situations. The lighthearted treatment of the hate and bigotry that led to the death of millions is not one of these. The attempt to do so in this movie is strained from the start, moves quickly to confusing, then embarrassing, then simply offensive. What's really frightening is the level of distortion and misinformation that serves as a backdrop for the more obvious schtick. Was there an attempt at an underlying message, sure. But it was lost in the trivialization of the Holocaust and catastrophe that was Naziism. As a paying member of the public, I felt not just bamboozled, but victimized, by this movie."
JOJO RABBIT,19 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. It shows the atrocities of the Nazis and war while packaging it for a wider range of viewers. It displays how ignorant the Nazis were and although satirical, accurate just the same."
JOJO RABBIT,4 January 2020,10/10,"Being a fan of anything that taika waititi touches I was looking forward to the release of jojo rabbit expecting a hilarious and stupidly funny movie.... Now this isn't strictly what I got although undoubtedly funny it was not however stupidly so. This film is a masterpiece in modern cinema being able to incorporate comedy, historical aspects, elements of a love story and more shockingly a deep and moving film which at one part hit me like a bowling ball to the stomach (if you see the movie you'll know the part). Applaude the delicate handling of the subject matter and implore any fan of any genre to give it a go there is a bit of something for everyone"
JOJO RABBIT,21 November 2019,10/10,"Amazing movie fills of laughs, tears and heart. Taika Waititi does it again, with humor that shows just how stupid Nazis are."
JOJO RABBIT,28 August 2020,1/10,Sad that someone born in 1975 can be so clueless about history to try to make a dark comedy look light- but it doesn't- sad!
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,I loved this movie. It had everything a great film should.
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,10/10,When I first saw the trailer I was thinking this was a straight comedy. I was surprised on a few occasions when my laughing became uncomfortable. This was a good thing and I was surprised on so many levels. The acting and characterization was brilliant and at the end I wanted more.I loved the soundtrack.
JOJO RABBIT,4 May 2020,10/10,"I found this movie while looking for one of those cheap comedies, one of those in which you don't have to think, kinda like white noise; instead I encountered one of the funniest tragedies. Me tears went from happiness to despair.
Hands down to one of the best films made on the matter."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,10/10,"This film is brilliant in every way! Its got everything, really enjoyed it. Very original take on WW2. Im going to watch it again very soon!"
JOJO RABBIT,3 March 2020,10/10,"So at last, my first review. And boy am I glad about the movie that finally got the thumb out of my backa. I was so utterly impressed by this movie and everything about it; script, story, directing, acting, camera, sound, costumes, scenery etc etc etc. Just everything.
Yes, how absolutely absurdely it might sound, it's true that we now get to watch a movie about Nazis, and enjoy it. Plenty. I have not laughed like this to a movie since my teenage years when I still found Mr. Bean funny AF. Just when you think Waititi can't simply keep on bringing any more hilarious lines, one more comes, and one more. And not just the script and the characters are funny, also the way everything ia portrayed through the kids eyes makes it all so much funnier but at the same time also realistic. And Jojo Rabbit the actor. Wow. How did this kid not become an Oscars winner or at least a nominee? I can't imagine a better casting. Just spot on.Waititi brings us a charming, weird, absurd, hilarious, sad and devastating movie all the same time. You will cry both happy and sad tears, that's for sure! Watch it!!"
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2020,,"The film is mediocre, it is not a drama or a comedy. Kids acting is great, but the writing and plot are just plain boring. If you are going to make a comedy from a very serious subject, at least do it well, but it seemed like they tried a lot of things and did not achieve anything. A movie you will forget in 2 weeks. Time wasted."
JOJO RABBIT,13 February 2020,8/10,"It's all about Jews !
yet really great movie loved the idea and the acting !"
JOJO RABBIT,2 March 2020,1/10,"This movie pretends to be all anti-war and anti-hate and yet it praises in many shots how Americans liberated Germans from the Nazis and made it first to Berlin by showing their flags and not showing any Soviet flags when we all know and it's a fact that Soviets made it first to Berlin. They show ""ruthless"" Soviets executing the Nazis and Americans being all full of joy and freedom. They didn't show the Nazis shoting, executing anyone, showing them silly and not serious at all. They obviously tried to make us feel sorry for the people of the Nazi Germany and yes, obviously by far not all the people were followers of this people-hating ideology, especially young people. I understand that it's a satire but why Soviets are being portayed like this then? Soviet Union lost the most amount of people during the Nazi occupation and war. It was Hitler's official orders of exterminating people, slavs in eastern Europe just like Jews or making slaves of them at best. Americans and people in the Western Europe often tend to forget this or simply ignore this horrible fact Now they dare to blacken Soviet achievments once again of not only liberating a good part of Europe but also defeating the Nazis at their very core while being one of the main targets of genocide without declaration of war and not being ready for war which was the reason of Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, to delay the war. The Nazis didn't plan on exterminating people of USA, Great Brittain, France, Norway and Etc. Americans and Brittish didn't have the Nazis on their land doing atrocities towards their women and children. Soviets had more than enough reasons for revenge and yet Stalin banned lynching and looting and punished own people for such things. So again, this movie is about anti-war and anti-hate, about love and friendship of peoples and yet it hypocritically shows how it doesn't apply to Soviet and Russian people. Double standards as always but I am surprised anyway that they did this again. I can't rate this movie higher than the minimum score for obvious reasons. I'm frustrated."
JOJO RABBIT,18 November 2019,10/10,"Brilliant, poignant, bittersweet and hilarious. I would never have believe all of these could be found in one story. I laughed at the spaciousness and cried at the pathos. Constantly entertained as the story wove together fantasy into the tragedy and sleeplessness of war. Don't watch if you are a literalist, you will be frustrated by the odd turns.
If, however, you like to be surprised and want a modern satire with threads of Springtime for Hitler (The Producers) this would be perfect."
JOJO RABBIT,5 January 2020,9/10,"Pleaseantly surprised about this movie. It was funny and started out as a comedy with heaps of absurdities, but the further the movie progressed the more beautiful and hopeful the story became. Really well acted and well worth a watch."
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,10/10,What a fabulous film Jojo Rabbit is! We laughed ... we cried. Watch out for the clever symbolic use of the shoes! Brilliant.
JOJO RABBIT,28 November 2020,10/10,"One of the funniest movies I've watched in a long time - laughed from start to finish! Beautifully filmed with some touching moments. However I didn't expect it to have such sad moments which really stuck with me... but the laughter came back through the tears! It reminded me of afterlife, if it was set in Nazi Germany.... loved every minute."
JOJO RABBIT,8 March 2020,1/10,"I'm just sorry I shortened my life by labouring through this self-indulgent, tedious and pointless drivel, which unfailingly fails with its extremely flaccid attempts at humour or drama. This was almost as bad as ""the Book of Mormon"". Live a little longer and skip this one."
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,5/10,"On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 384 reviews, with an average rating of The website's critics cons"
JOJO RABBIT,1 April 2020,9/10,"Most negative reviewers don't seem to understand that this is a vision of a complex time from the perspective of a 10 year old, ala, what Salieri's madness brought to Amadeus. An ingenious way to tell a story we've already seen countless times. It's not Hitler, it's a 10 year old's imaginary friend, they aren't Nazis, they are all adults from a 10 year olds perspective ... and the movie adds insight into the world of WWII without kicking us in our Private Ryan."
JOJO RABBIT,30 December 2019,10/10,"Best movie of the year.
Please watch it you will not be disappointed."
JOJO RABBIT,5 October 2020,5/10,"Highpoints are excellent, on-point, funny performances by an ensemble cast. Easy to imagine that everyone had fun on screen. Good soundtrack, good writing. The film is very colorful and stylised which I cant decide if it works or not.However for a film with such a unorthodox concept it is extremely predictable and lacks a lot of emotional weight. The characters are stereotyped so far that the highs and lows, goods and evils come over so heavy-handed I ended up feeling nothing after some chuckles. I am sure someone wilm be offended by this movie because it featured a dancing Adolf Hitler and some wacky Nazi figures. I am more offended personally by the way this movie at times treats its audience.By the way, did anyone notice that in the end the girl ended up manipulating the boy like he was told jews would. Just a thought.Anyway, I recommend watching if you are bored and have access. Make up your own mind, dont believe the hype."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,10/10,This movie has the perfect balance between comedy and drama. The perfect feelgood movie. See it now if you haven't!
JOJO RABBIT,5 February 2020,10/10,It's the best movie with hitler as an imaginary friend ever.
JOJO RABBIT,8 May 2020,10/10,"I don't know that this can be called a comedy.
It has heartwarming moments, it makes you smile, laugh once or twice. It's very clever, it's charming.
And it is heartbreaking - because it is these things - and it is hopeful because it is these things.
I watched it with my ten year old son and fourteen year old daughter, exactly 75 years after the defeat of the Nazis.
And my son lost some of his innocence, but I am glad it was with this film.
It is excellent and I applaud everyone involved with it.
A beautiful, heartbreaking, warm, shattering, hopeful film."
JOJO RABBIT,28 December 2019,10/10,Jojo Rabbit was one the best films I have seen recently. It weaves a poignant message through stellar acting and comical satire while not washing over the incredibly dark subject matter. It brilliantly breaks down how ridiculous the hate (the divisions) we create are...and may make you want to dance through the tears by the end of it.
JOJO RABBIT,16 February 2020,2/10,"I saw this with my step-dad, my 12-yr old son, and his best friend. None of us liked it. The acting is excellent, and I can see where it tried to be funny, or ""heartwarming"" and cute, but I just can't find any of it funny. There is nothing funny about Nazi Germany, and I just can't be cynical enough to accept the whole premise. Especially in the environment here in America right now."
JOJO RABBIT,18 May 2020,1/10,"A distorted movie .. You don't know what its writer wants ! No comedy, no drama ! Sad for the great actors who participated in it .. More sad for the evaluation given to him"
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,10/10,Great movie to watch along the family... Great movie to watch along the family... Great movie to watch along the family...
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,10/10,"I am keeping it short
This movie is brilliant in so many ways. I am looking forward to buying the dvd for the director's commentary."
JOJO RABBIT,15 February 2020,10/10,Boring would never be the right word to describe this film.
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,7/10,"Whilst amusing at times, I was left worried about how this would be viewed by Jewish people and descendants. I felt at times that it made light of a hideous part of history and horror that so many experienced. Maybe I may not have judged it quite as harshly if it was made by a Jewish descendent rather than a New Zealander."
JOJO RABBIT,12 February 2020,10/10,"-THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE-
I can't express it in words. What a performance from every actor,even the young ones (Actually... ESPECIALLY from the young ones).
NOW,that's a GOOD CAST PICK (WATCH AND LEARN HOLLYWOOD (O_O) ).
It's definitely worth to watch it. Go grab some Pop Corn and enjoy."
JOJO RABBIT,19 January 2020,1/10,"Hitler and happy children around it... Only the idea to put those two things together is crazy! First ever Nazi comedy for all family, disgusting by its nature, there is no satire it just as simple as that! THERE IS MOCKERY OF THE VICTIMS OF WORLD WAR 2! All those parasites who call itself actors and directors it's funny to see how low they can go in order to earn a buck! Oscars? Really? What's next?"
JOJO RABBIT,20 January 2020,8/10,"Like many, when I first saw the poster for Jojo Rabbit - I took a sharp intake of breath. The sight of Taika Waititi, a director who I respect greatly, dressed as a whimsical version of Hitler, made me uneasy. Can an individual who caused misery to so many, who scarred and ended so many lives, be the centrepiece for a drama-comedy?Indeed, particularly with the rise of neo-Nazism across the globe, there's a concern that in some way we make light of these atrocities.It's with relief then, that writer and director Taika Waititi has managed to strike a balance between humour and a brutal teardown of the manners in which the Nazi party acted.Set during WW2, Jojo Rabbit follows the story of Jojo Betzler (played astoundingly well by Roman Griffin Davis), a member of the Hitler Youth who iconises the Fuhrer, and strongly believes in the future of Nazi Germany. He quickly demonstrates a frightening level of nationalism, whilst revealing a fundamental lack of understanding of the concepts he is being told.We're introduced to these elements during a Hitler Youth camp - a section heavily inspired by Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom. Indeed, for these first 20 minutes the film does struggle to find its own identity, and the audience I was with was evidence for this. We collectively were unsure about where the humour lay.True, Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job as Captain Klenzendorf, the lackadaisical camp leader, and Rebel Wilson's brings her dry comedic chops to Fraulein Rahm as she feeds the children lies about Jewish people having horns (shockingly, a myth that was conceived in the Middle Ages and is apparently still prevalent today). But not all the jokes landed. I, for one, am also tired of campy homosexual relations being the butt of a joke.A challenge here was that - Jojo Rabbit is clearly from the eyes of a child, demonstrating his innocence in the world. However, in this first section Waititi's needs to make this more obvious. Once we understand this then the perspective of what we are seeing changes - yes, the adults are sometimes incompetent - but do we have an unreliable narrator? This lens in which the film has been made helps make the comedy in it palatable and doesn't undermine the more unsettling and heart-rendering moments.The act ends with Jojo being involved in an accident that leaves him scarred and disfigured. Jojo, feeling dejected, must then run simple errands around his town. Until one day he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in their home.As Elsa is introduced some of the shots could be directly taken out of the The Ring or The Conjuring. They are ridiculous, but they also emphasise the child's eye view that we are being fed. At this stage Jojo truly believes Jews to be devilish and something to fear. It's often said that there is a thin line between horror and comedy, and Waititi seem to have embraced this.It is the relationships of Jojo and Elsa, and Jojo and his mother, that the film focuses on. His internal conflict, and his slow softening of heart to the ""enemy within"".Similarly, Stephen Merchant's SS character, while superficially amicable and inane, manages to underline his character with a sinister tension and an uneasy sense of foreboding. Equally, Waititi's Hitler, loses his playful demeanor when Jojo starts to turn his back on him. The smiling faces slowly start to take on the visage of Stephen King's It.The film also owes a debt to Four Lions - I've seen some criticism that the idiotic nature of many of the adult characters only serves to make light of the horrors of Nazism. However, just like Four Lions used this same inane-ness to steal the dignity away from extremist terrorists, Jojo Rabbit does the same. It mocks the rise in neo-Nazis and reduces their value.Credit must also be given to the symbolism within the film. Some more obvious, like the use of the butterfly to represent Jojo's mother, to more subtle framing (Cinematographer: Mihai Malaimare Jr.) to emphasise the role of shoes within the film - as a symbol of maturity and freedom.I left the cinema feeling at peace with the film that Waititi had set out to make. It tackles many difficult issues - and finds sympathy in a lot of unexpected places. However, it also pulls no punches - at its heart, while not a satire, it pulls apart the foundations of the Nazi party, and the methods used by extremists to indoctrinate the young."
JOJO RABBIT,29 March 2020,2/10,"There is nothing commendable in this movie. The movie trivializes atrocities, stereotypes, horror, personal relationships, and on and on.Is the ""comedy"" in the cute exchanges between 10 year old boys? I suppose. Is the personal insight in the relationships in families? There is some of that. But not more than any other 2 star rated film, and the backdrop of these short scenes is the Nazi system. Is the point to laugh at the Nazis? Do we laugh at hangings of good people?This is a bizarre and utterly useless film. It is certainly not entertainment or a documentary or anything else redeeming that anyone to pay to watch."
JOJO RABBIT,31 December 2019,10/10,"I've been a member of IMDB for years and it's my first time writing a review.
The movie is hilarious, while incredibly heavy.
While you're laughing, you also feel the heartbreaking pain.
While normal war movie makes you hold breath and is hard to bear. JoJo Rabbit portraits the whole madness and darkness in a funny way, highlighting humanity.
Every single actor is superb! Director & screenplay is genius.
In a war, there is no winner.
Remember the pain and be grateful for what we have and living in the moment for a wonderful life."
JOJO RABBIT,14 February 2020,9/10,"Who'd of thought that a film about the Nazis could make you laugh, I also cried ... fantastic film, even down to the subtle nuances in some scenes. Great acting, all with plausible accents and the music just topped it off. Just brilliant!"
JOJO RABBIT,26 December 2019,7/10,Jojo Rabbit is a really good film even if it did feel pretty cliche at times. Taika Waititi made a film that has it comedic moments but knows when to be serious.
JOJO RABBIT,1 March 2020,8/10,"Go to the Limits of Your Longing"":
""Let everything happen to you:
beauty and terror.
Just keep going. No feeling is final.""And if you want to understand this, watch the movie. Almost on lines of the movie that changed my life.. Life is Beautiful."
JOJO RABBIT,8 June 2020,10/10,"Really entertaining and great fun to watch, really great direction too."
JOJO RABBIT,23 February 2020,,"My review is not so much a review, but a commentary on exactly what this movie might be able to comment on. This is not real, their accents are stumbling, and could be quite offensive to actual Germans. However, Nazism is quite offensive to many people as well, and my intuition leads me to think that Germans will tend to sit out of that critique, unless they're desiring to face the Holocaust critique.If you are an enlightened being, open to be challenged and amused, and cry, and laugh, and love a strong headed little boy, whose acting as he thinks he should, because of influences of society and establishment, then don't be afraid, I swear the laughs will absorb the tears.This is us, we are not always right, and sometimes, being wrong is too easily accessible. Sit back, or forward... You too, have been a Jojo Rabbit, at one time, or another."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2020,10/10,"Go watch this masterpiece. Makes you laugh, cry and feel god when it's over. I am still trying to find out why its metascore's rating is 58, which should be a crime."
JOJO RABBIT,4 April 2021,1/10,Very disappointed to be watching this film.Comedy? No.Satire? Ah ... No.For kids? No.
JOJO RABBIT,26 January 2020,,"SS Rise Kingdom.There's way to sweet much of Wes Anderson in this movie.
The director hasn't defected from the great comicity of what we do in the shadows. and he keeps embracing the sweet and delicate balance between good and evil. hope he's gonna spread more original ideas on the celluloid. Jojo It's just two steps beyond the classic nazi narrative. Who's good may not be as good as they think they are, who's bad may be way better than many. I just love the way this movie manages to speak about homosexuality, it's just too great. Happy feelings may not last long, Jews may be way more scaries than everen , because everything it's just pure magic gifted by the actors and the camera."
JOJO RABBIT,9 October 2021,9/10,"I enjoyed the movie alot!This movie is kind of a depiction of what was going in in nazi Germany from a kids perspective. With a missing father figure JoJo joins the Hitlerjugend to be a part of something (or at least is what i think is what happened with why JoJo joined the Jugend). With every shenanigan that happens between JoJo and Elsa, he learns what its like for the people he's oppressing. This is a story about a boy realising consequenses of his actions. It's also a insight of the insane nazi-indoctrination, which is portrayed with hilarious thoughts from Jojo about Jews.All of this combined with the incredible talent of these young actors makes a importent and hartfelt approach to the typical WW2 film, which is more accessible for people who don't typpically like to watch those kind of films.If we stop making reminders for people of what happend in WW2, history will repeat itself."
JOJO RABBIT,23 November 2019,10/10,I will admit that when I first saw the trailer I didn't quite know what to make of the film but I went with an open mind and I'm so glad I did. This is an amazing film that will make you laugh and cry in all the right ways. I have seen it multiple times and every time I get something new out of it. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie!!!!!!!!!
JOJO RABBIT,26 March 2020,10/10,"Quite possibly the funniest, depressing, and saddest uplifting movie I have seen. The entire spectrum at full brightness!Instantly became one of my favourite movies."
JOJO RABBIT,18 March 2020,9/10,"This is a movie everyone should watch, this breathtaking and heartwarming story is much more than just a movie"
JOJO RABBIT,21 July 2021,7/10,I very enjoy wathcing this movie. A child's vision very emotional and war is only for big mans. Child is always child.
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,Although there some funny scenes through the film there our some very serious and sad scenes which JoJo experience. Both Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell put on an outstanding performance.
JOJO RABBIT,28 February 2021,10/10,"I dont do and Reviews normaly, but wow what a movie
Its funny, its well acted, its smart, its sad it shows that people can change for the Vetter and it realy touched my Heart
I wish More people would watch this movie"
JOJO RABBIT,1 January 2020,10/10,"I'll admit the first 30+ mins in I thought "" oh boy the Alt-Right/Snowflakes are going to lose their mind with this one!! Oufff
I saw the satire, thankfully it got so over the top with it that no one with any inkling of history,propaganda and a sense of humour would see, its right up their alley!
Its heart warming, funny, sad, great acting.. did I say funny?
One of the best i've seen!"
JOJO RABBIT,6 February 2020,9/10,"First of all I am really impressed with the screenplay and how beautifully Taika Waititi directed the film. Although the movie is a bit depressing at some times, it still captures the audience through the innocence of the protagonist"
JOJO RABBIT,18 January 2020,9/10,"A unique film that is funny, sad, unexpected and thought provoking. It doesn't allow you to get too comfortable. A fresh look at a difficult phenomenon."
JOJO RABBIT,8 November 2019,10/10,"A satirical Post-American invasion movie set in Germany that's hard to describe without saying ""It's an amazing Nazi movie!"". The main protagonist is a 10yo German boy who's imaginary friend and roll model is Adolf Hitler played by Taika Waititi, whose character along with the child's had the audience audibly laughing at least 10 times or more. The director somehow managed to create a movie with both the light hearted and beautiful naïveté of a child's heart and plant it right in the middle of one of the ugliest warfares in World War history, without managing to diminish the value of either."
JOJO RABBIT,8 February 2021,9/10,"The more times I watch Jo Jo the better it gets.
Strong comic roles in Capt K, and The best friend are a delight."
JOJO RABBIT,17 November 2019,10/10,"Brilliant! I laughed, I cried. Beautifully acted an absolute gem!"
JOJO RABBIT,27 December 2019,10/10,"A great narrative surrounded by the events of WWII. I particular found Scarlet Johansson' s performance stunning as a mother who's ideologies conflict with that of the Third Reich. Taika Waititi also deserves credit for being able to make Hitler a character that meant something to the story. Overall, a masterpiece."
JOJO RABBIT,30 November 2020,8/10,"Taika Watitti is known for comedic humorous plays. Continuing the same habbit comes the sensational motion picture Jojo Rabbit. Watitti has been able to bring the helpless sensation of th WW2.
For most of the people it might be a comedy but for me it was a tragedy."
JOJO RABBIT,3 January 2020,10/10,"Words cannot describe my experience watching this movie. The way it manages to balance tone and such a serious topic is unrivalled. To say this is a masterpiece would to be an understatement. It makes you laugh, cry, cry of laughter and make you feel so much more. I truly can't believe the genius that is Jojo Rabbit. Fantastisch"
JOJO RABBIT,3 February 2020,10/10,"The best movie of 2019. Humor, drama, love fear and joy"
JOJO RABBIT,24 October 2019,3/10,"Three stars, because it did have a few good original jokes and the production was on par for a Hollywood movie.... unfortunately, nothing else about this movie was good.Just another political satire movie for??? Kids maybe?"
JOJO RABBIT,20 February 2020,1/10,"I know they say dark humor but really?Not humerous at all! I was disinterested at the beginning and then it took me about 20 minutes to get over the scene with all the peer pressure and ""kill the rabbit"". Adults getting kids to chant ""kill, kill, kill"" and when the kid couldn't kill the rabbit after adults told him how to break its neck... they took it from him, broke its neck (not really of course) and threw it in the woods!Then the scene with the book drawn about Jews and treatment of Jews and oh how they laughed at the scenes depicted.Not bad enough that he saw people hanging earlier in the movie.. then he had to find his own mother hanging!Not sure who ever thought this was a movie worth producing but I wish I had those 2 hours of my life back!!"
