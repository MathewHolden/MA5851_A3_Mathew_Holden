BROOKLYN,28 February 2018,9/10,"""Brooklyn"" was a frustrating movie to watch. So much of it was perfect...the amazing costuming that really evoked the early 1950s, great direction, the amazingly perfect music and some of the best acting I've seen in years. Yet despite having all this, the film STILL frustrated me because of a problem with the plot. This problem is an easy one to work out...yet inexplicably it became monstrously huge. Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is a young Irish lady who has just learned she's being sponsored to go to America. While she's thrilled with a chance at a new life, it's all so overwhelming and strange and you follow Eilis on her journey. The first half of the film is incredibly sweet and nice. I knew since it was a movie things could not stay this way but I sure was hoping it would. Sadly, Eilis' sister has died and she must go back home...and leave the lovely Italian-American man she's come to love and just married. Inexplicably, when she arrives back in Ireland, she doesn't tell anyone she is married and even leads a wonderful man on by making him think he had a chance with her. And, through all this I felt like screaming ""WHY wouldn't you just tell everyone you are married and be done with it??? That's what any sane person would do!!""....and that is why no matter how much I loved the film it misses out on being a classic."
BROOKLYN,29 September 2017,8/10,"Love drama and with a great cast that includes Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and promising former child actress Saoirse Ronan, talented Nick Horby adapting the lovely gentle read that is the book, 'Brooklyn' seemed my kind of film.My thoughts after seeing 'Brooklyn' was that it was a lovely film. Not quite top 10 of 2015 material but one of the easier to watch and like films of the year, providing that the gentle deliberate pacing does not bother you (it didn't me). 'Brooklyn' has a slight and simple story that doesn't break boundaries, cover new ground and lacks edge, but this does not matter when it is as sweet, charming and touching as it is.Faults are few actually. The final third is a little forced with some of it feeling a bit too neat and a slightly passive indecisiveness, even for her conflicting emotions and difficulties with following her heart, in the lead character that wasn't there for the rest of the film. Despite a natural easy-going chemistry with Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen is a little too laid back in his role that he comes over as dull.Ronan however is terrific, she was a promising child actress as said, here in 'Brooklyn' she comes of age and gives her character nuance and pathos without weakening the character. In support, the standout is the sheer comic delight that is Walters while Broadbent is suitably robust. Domhnall Gleeson is charming.John Crowley keeps things beautifully controlled without slacking. 'Brooklyn' looks beautiful, the 1950s setting is austere yet strikingly evocative and the cinematography positively glows. Michael Brooks' score is subtle but very well suited to the period and the film's tone.Scripting is intelligent, emotion-soaked and has the right amount of charm and sweetness without going sugary or frothy. Some may find that story-wise it's small in scale, being slight and conventional somewhat, but there is no denying that 'Brooklyn' has a big heart and that the love story is beguiling that shows the film making successful efforts at depth and truth.It's as warm as sitting by the fireplace with a pair of slippers on your feet and drinking hot milk and am not the first to admit having tears of joy (there are some understated humorous moments without busting a gut, which was appropriate) and sadness (it's a tear-jerker but doesn't try too hard to be or manipulate people into getting emotional, the emotion is very much genuine). The characters are well written and for what they may lack in depth they more than make up for with heart and charm.Overall, a lovely, beguiling, warm love story that may be small in its scale but when it comes to the heart it couldn't shine any bigger. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
BROOKLYN,2 January 2016,,"Brooklyn (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Saoirse Ronan plays Ellis, an Irish immigrant who leaves her entire world behind to take an offer to start from the ground in Brooklyn, NY during the 1950s. At first the young woman finds herself homesick and unable to get used to her new surroundings but this all changes when she meets a man (Emory Cohen) and falls for him.BROOKLYN is a rather small movie about a small person but it's so brilliantly acted and so well-made that it's easy to see why it's getting so much love. The movie isn't full of special effects or loud explosions but instead it's a rather warm and beautiful character study about the impact of two different cultures and how one must follow their heart and not just what is expected of them. While there's nothing ground-breaking or 100% original here, there's no question that it's a film that one can easily fall in love with.The best thing about the picture is without question the performance of Ronan who really breaks through the screen. I hadn't seen the actress is too many roles before this one but it's easy to see that she has a major presence on the screen and there's no question that she nails the rather difficult role. The role asks her to play all sorts of ranges and the actress nails all of them. This includes the rather shy and depressed girl at the start of the picture and the way Ronan shows the character coming into her own is just a pleasure to watch. It's certainly one of the most detailed performances that you're going to see in the year.The supporting cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses who really do a wonderful job in their roles. Cohen really deserves special mention as he nearly steals every scene he's in with a terrific laid back performance. The screenplay takes its time building up the characters but the entire thing just comes across so authentic. You really do feel as if you're watching real people in a real world. The visual look of the film is quite excellent and the costume design and sets are terrific and really transport you back to the 1950s.BROOKLYN isn't the first movie to deal with a homesick immigrant who finds love but it's just so fresh and warm that it's easy to fall in love with its characters and just go along with the ride."
BROOKLYN,4 May 2016,7/10,"It's the 1950's. Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) is a reserved young woman in Enniscorthy, Ireland, living with her mother and sister Rose. She emigrates to America where Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) has sponsored her. She's staying in Madge Kehoe (Julie Walters)'s girls' boarding house. She struggles with her job and homesickness. Father Flood gets her into accounting school. She is pursued by Italian boy Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen).Saoirse Ronan is a terrific performer. She brings out something powerful. The story has few surprises. The plot is flat and the drama is limited. This is a very simple immigrant story. It does get at some universal truths in that experience. It would help if Emory Cohen is more charismatic. I don't mind that he's not the stereotypical Italian character but he needs more power. There is limited heat and it's all generated by Saoirse's will of personality. She is great. The movie needs to get up to her level."
BROOKLYN,30 January 2016,6/10,"This description implies a positive as well as a negative component. 2015's ""Brooklyn"" is very watchable from start to finish, but has no moments that really exuded brilliance of any kind. It scored a Best Picture nomination with the Oscars this year and famous writer Nick Hornby, who did not write the original, but adapted the material for the screen, got in too. Same goes for talented young actress Saoirse Ronan playing the lead character. It makes totally sense that she does as she is by far the most known Irish actress from her age group and was already an Oscar nominee before this film. Supporting cast includes a couple well-known names too such as Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters.The story is about a young woman (after World War II) who is stuck between her family living in Ireland and her future in the United States. At the same time, she is stuck between two men who have feelings for her and she does have feelings for them as well. It is a very simple plot really and nothing too outstanding or memorable in terms of the story. The only really interesting aspect is which path she will choose in the end and if we even find out. Predictability is certainly not a weakness of this film here. There are no weaknesses altogether, but there are also no outstanding moments. I am okay with Ronan's nomination, even if I myself would not honor her in any way, but as for the Academy picking this film as one of the finest of the year, I cannot agree at all. Oh yeah, director is John Crowley and you may have seen his ""Boy A"" starring Andrew Garfield. Looks like he has a nice touch in terms of getting strong performances out of young actors. All in all, I recommend the watch, but only if you are a great Ronan fan or like films set around 1950. The latter, however, is also a bit of a problem as the film really relied mostly on the relationships between the characters and the inner turmoil of the protagonist. This movie certainly could have needed more historic references. In a perfect scenario, these would have been included instead of some of the not too interesting scenes, so this film could have been kept at 100 minutes and nothing of value would have been lost. Still, overall, a positive verdict from me. Thumbs up."
BROOKLYN,17 September 2016,7/10,"Sometimes you may not feel the love someone else feels for you. Sometimes a city may be the recipient of that love. Or it's just the dream and the coming of age that makes you feel you belong somewhere you just landed. While this has many themes and paints a really big picture (which some may find a bit too much for their liking, depending on their taste), it does hold together pretty well.The acting is really something and the story really takes you on a journey (no pun intended). There is something for everyone to be found here and even though I've never been to Brooklyn (or America for that matter), the romantic idea of it makes it look fantastic. If you really want something, you have to go get it ... no matter what other say or have experienced, you have to make your own way ..."
BROOKLYN,13 February 2016,8/10,"What the picture made me do was reflect on what my grandmother must have felt like when she emigrated to America as a teenager. She too left family behind for a better life and I had never really given much thought to what that experience might have entailed in terms of longing for the past while trying to assimilate into a new environment and culture. For her, that occurred at the turn of the Twentieth Century, much earlier than this picture's setting. In fact the story does seem to take place quite a few decades prior to 1952, at least that's the impression I had while watching until the time frame presented itself.This was my first glimpse of Saoirse Ronan and I thought she gave a thoughtful portrayal of someone challenged to face the unknown with a determination to persevere and succeed. What's interesting about the story is that there are no insurmountable obstacles to overcome, but simply day to day life that needs to be dealt with as opportunities present themselves. Back in Ireland following the death of her sister Rose (Fiona Glascott), Eilis (Ronan) successfully resists the attempts of her mother and former acquaintances to reconsider her life, with a pivotal moment occurring when shopkeeper Mrs. Kelly attempts her blackmail routine on the young woman. In a finely crafted scene Eilis puts the woman in her place with an uncommon strength of character that defined her newly acquired maturity.The picture finds itself in good company for this year's Academy Award nominations. As good as Ronan's performance was though, I don't think it's enough to carry the film to a Best Picture win against some of it's more dramatic competition. However it's a genuinely heartwarming picture, beautifully filmed, with a nostalgic feel for anyone that might have grown up during the era."
BROOKLYN,1 February 2016,7/10,"An Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.There is not much to say about ""Brooklyn"". It has two good things going for it. One, obviously, is a strong lead from actress Saoirse Ronan. As this is more or less one person's story, she carries the film, and her Best Actress nomination is no surprise. She has very little chance of winning when up against Brie Larson, but a nomination is still an achievement. Ronan fans will be quite pleased.The other standout feature is the cinematography. While it was not nominated for such, it is worth pointing out the intense colors used to show the moods and time periods. Being Irish, of course, there are many bright shades of green. If Eilis (Ronan) is not dressed in green, someone next to her will be. It is quite a vibrant film.Many critics put the film in their top ten for 2015, some even giving it a solid first place. What those critics saw and what I saw are two very different films. While this is a good movie, it really amounts to little more than a romantic drama. It has a bit of weight thrown in by making it a period piece and having the trans-Atlantic angle. But underneath that, it is the same old story of falling in love... perhaps too quickly.""Brooklyn"" is the odd-man-out for the Best Picture category. It is a film that is clearly on the lower end of the list and probably never should have made it at all. ""Carol"" would have been the obvious replacement, or even ""The Hateful Eight"". Perhaps ""The Danish Girl"". But whichever, it seems very unlikely that of all the movies released in 2015, ""Brooklyn"" was among the very best."
BROOKLYN,19 July 2019,10/10,"I heard about ""Brooklyn""'s release in 2015-2016, but due to my life situation at the time (it's a long story) I never got around to seeing it. I finally have. What an experience. There have been a lot of movies about immigrants and about Ireland - there could be an entire college course focusing on either of these - but I think that this particular film deserves special recognition. The story and performances are the main strength, but there's also the moral issue that the movie address (loyalty to one's roots vs. one's future).In the lead role of Eilis, Saoirse Ronan has the role of a lifetime. We all loved her performances in ""Hanna"" and ""Lady Bird"", but this will probably go down as her greatest one. Which is not to subtract from her co-stars. Everyone puts in their best efforts here and it shows. Without a doubt, this is a movie for the ages. A true credit to Ireland.As to the issue of whether or not it should've won any of the Oscars for which it got nominated, we can debate that forever. I'd say that every nominee that year had its merits."
BROOKLYN,21 January 2016,8/10,"I saw this reviewed on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, then it got attention when awards season came along, with many positive opinions and the award nominations it received I was definitely going to see this, directed by John Crowley (Boy Z, Is Anybody There?). Basically set in 1952, Eilis (pronounced AY-lish) Lacey (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Saoirse Ronan) is a young woman from the small town of Enniscorthy in southeast Ireland, she works at weekends in a shop run by the spiteful Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan). Eilis's older sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) has arranged for her to go to the United States of America to find a better future, on departure she suffers seasickness and food poisoning, and is locked out of the toilet by the cabin neighbours. Eilis is given advice and support by the women in the bottom bed bunk, she is an experienced traveller, this helps her with entry into the US and starts her new life in a boarding house in Brooklyn, New York. The home is full of many Irish immigrants, Eilis and her fellow residents, all young women, dine every night together with traditionalist Irish landlady Mrs. Madge Keogh (BAFTA nominated Julie Walters). Eilis soon finds work at a department store, but she earns gentle scolding from her superior Miss Fortini (Jessica Paré) because she is shy and quiet when serving customers, and writing letters to sister Rose back in Ireland only causes her homesickness. Eilis has an interest in working in finance and accounting, so she is visited by Irish priest Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) who arranged for her job and accommodation, he tries to enrol her in bookkeeping classes. One evening Eilis attends a dance, there she meets Italian young man Anthony ""Tony"" Fiorello (Emory Cohen), he is most interested in her and becomes her boyfriend, these developments make Eilis feel much more comfortable in New York, but she is slow to return her declaration of love. Father Flood gives Eilis the devastating news that her sister Rose has suddenly died from an unknown illness, speaking with her mother Mary (Jane Brennan), who is struggling to cope following the funeral, Eilis decides to return home to Ireland for a visit. Tony insists that before she leaves they must first secretly marry, they do so without telling either of their family or friends, upon her arrival it seems that everyone is conspiring to stop Eilis from returning to Brooklyn. Eilis does have a scheduled return in a week, but she cancels as her mother has accepted, on her behalf, an invitation to attend the wedding of her best friend. Then it seems that Eilis is being set up on dates, no- one being aware that she is married, with eligible bachelor Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), a young man on the verge of inheriting property, she is also given emergency basis work to replace her sister as a bookkeeper, she starts to feel that now she has a future in Ireland that did not exist before, and she stops opening letters from Tony. Her former employer Miss Kelly however discovers that she is already married, Eilis recalls that there are no secrets in her small town, word spreads fast, so she informs her mother of her marriage, and that she will be returning to Brooklyn the next day. On the ship returning to America, Eilis plays the role of an experienced traveller, offering her own words of guidance to a first time young woman immigrant, in the end Eilis and Tony are reunited and happily embrace. Also starring Emily Bett Rickards as Patty McGuire, Michael Zegen as Maurizio, Nora-Jane No one as Sheila, Paulino Nunes as Mr. Fiorello, Eileen O'Higgins as Nancy, Jenn Murray as Dolores, Eve Macklin as Diana Montini and Mary O'Driscoll as Miss McAdam. Ronan is a fabulous choice to play the young Irish woman finding her place, including where she calls home and her romance, there are great supporting performances also from Walters, Broadbent, Cohen and Gleeson. It is a very simple story, an Irish girl goes to America, and then things happen to force her home, and she is torn between her old life and new life, you could argue there is nothing edgy or ground-breaking in the plot, but it doesn't matter, the coming-of- age and romantic elements work well, it is authentic with the time period and is just simply good old-fashioned entertainment, a most enjoyable historical period drama. It was nominated the Oscar the Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Nick Hornby (About a Boy), and it won the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it was nominated, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair. Very good!"
BROOKLYN,15 August 2016,6/10,"It's a quiet and deliberately paced movie by today's standards in that nobody's head gets wrenched off.The plot is simple enough on the surface. Ronan is a plain Irish girl who, finding life stifling, moves to Brooklyn, where she finds a job, lives in a boarding house full of other Irish girls, and attends night class at Brooklyn College with the intention of becoming an accountant some day.The other boarding house girls, some of them more tolerant of peccadilloes than the others, teach her how to dress, use make up, and act. Well -- I mean, after all, she's been shuffling around in these shabby dresses wearing clodhoppers and doesn't smile, let alone laugh.The courtship of a nice quiet Italian guy helps things along. The two are married before circumstances force her to return to Cork, where she must make up her mind about staying or returning to her husband in Brooklyn.What a refreshing movie. If the plot, with a few changes, could have been lifted from a Harlequin romance, the film is anything but shallow. It depends to a great extent on the sensitivity of the viewer because not everything is spelled out except in a minimal way by fleeting glances, grins, and gestures.Also there's Saoirse Ronan. She's grown up now and looks a bit like the equally grown up but now deliquesced Dakota Fanning. It's a great face. It's broad and pale and it features two sizable blue eyes; it's the kind of face that could go in any direction, from an action movie (""Hanna"") to absurdist comedy (""The Hotel Budapest"") to a serious romantic drama, as here. The kid can act too.It's worth catching."
BROOKLYN,23 May 2016,,"I found this on DVD at my local public library, my wife and I enjoyed it. To me, one of the better movies in 2015. In fact it was nominated, but did not win, Best Picture.The USA of course was built over the centuries via immigration. The novel this movie is based on focuses on the 1950s which, according to a comment in the extras, saw about 12 Million Irish coming over. Mostly because of limited opportunity in their homeland.This story focuses on the fictional character Eilis (sounds almost like 'Irish') played by Saoirse Ronan, who won some Best Actor awards for her performance, however did not win the Oscar. Still it is an outstanding performance and Ms Ronan again shows us she is one of the better young actresses today.Starting in 1951, Eilis is bright and well-adjusted but all she can get is part time work at a local store in her small town. And almost no chance for a man. A family friend in Brooklyn, a priest (Jim Broadbent), arranges for her to have a place to stay in a boarding house for single working ladies and a job at a large department store. She takes the boat!As she settles into this new life, missing Ireland terribly, she meets a nice young Italian man who adores her. It seems that they might get married. But a tragedy back in Ireland forces her to return for a while and there she meets new people, requiring her to ask herself if she really wanted to go back to Brooklyn. The time-eternal tug between old familiar people and places and the new.The story is very well told, well-acted, and beautifully filmed. It runs just under 1 hour 45 minutes which seems just right.SPOILERS: Right as Eilis is about to return to Ireland her boyfriend asks her to marry him. She is hesitant but does, however she does not tell mom or friends when she arrives back home after her only sister died suddenly. The new guy she meets desperately wants her to stay and she seems to be considering it. But when the mean store owner calls her aside and says she knows Eilis is married, Eilis realizes how petty people are in the small town, it can never feel like home again after her experiences in Brooklyn, she returns ASAP and starts her new life with her new husband."
BROOKLYN,26 February 2016,8/10,"Saoirse Ronan plays a young Irish immigrant coming to the U.S. escaping lack of opportunities of her native country. She manages to find a job, go to school, and meet someone after arriving in Brooklyn. Then something tragic happens to someone close to her back home and...I'll stop there and just say this was quite a touching story of this woman who gets caught in what kind of life she wants to live as well as what she considers her identity in which environment. There's also some nice humorous scenes especially concerning various dinners at a boardinghouse she shares with other young woman as well as the elderly border host played by Julie Walters. Nice use of music and scenery throughout. So on that note, I highly recommend Brooklyn."
BROOKLYN,14 August 2016,10/10,"The processes of identification and assimilation are beautifully treated in this 2015 film with Saiorse Ronan giving an Oscar nominated performance.What were the real reasons that the priest sponsored this young lady to begin with. Did Brooklyn College really look like that in the 1950s? Methinks not, but the film is beautifully realized through its simplification.Alone, quiet but with a desire to succeed, Ronan makes the long trip to America to work in a department store. She is terribly withdrawn and immediately captures the eye of the floor supervisor. That all changes at an Irish dance, when she meets an Italian plumber and the two hit it off with a city hall wedding following.With the death of her sister, she returns to Ireland where she plans to attend a friend's wedding. Keeping her marriage a secret, she is romanced by another good man and finally through coincidence, she reveals her marriage to a still-grieving mother.The film offers light regarding the opportunities, experiences and ways of living for the immigrants in America."
BROOKLYN,23 December 2015,,"This film tells the story of a young Irish woman who goes to Brooklyn on search of a new life. There she finds a job, gets an education and falls in love with an Italian man. She is faced with a tough decision when she finds out tragedy had struck her home in Ireland.""Brooklyn"" tells how Eilis settles into the American life, fighting various hardships. The beginning of the film is quite memorable, as a horribly wicked character called Miss Kelly terrorises the small town. Then a helpful woman on the ship brings balance to the plot. Then, the story slowly enfolds, telling what happens to the daily life of an ordinary girl. I find the story interesting but not particularly captivating or engaging. Ronan is a good actress as usual, but she is not enough to make the rather plain film breathtaking. ""Brooklyn"" is a love story back in those days when life was simpler and tougher, but it is not particularly memorable."
BROOKLYN,13 May 2016,4/10,"Brooklyn was one of those films during the last awards season that came from seemingly nowhere and clinched lots of big prizes.And this seems quite correct because it's a decent film, full of heart and good performances. Nick Hornby manages to both add and celebrate the work of Colm Tobin, the original novelist as well.It's a classic love story at its centre. Full of choices and missed opportunities, this film could have come from any era.I enjoyed the film, I found myself caught up in the story, but it won't go down as one of my favourite films of all time purely because I found it a bit slow in places and contrived in others."
BROOKLYN,28 October 2016,10/10,"Brooklyn stars Saoirse Ronan,who portrays the main character Eilis Lacey,a young woman from Ireland who heads towards Ellis Island to pursue the American Dream. It was based on the Colm Tóibín's novel of the same title.Emory Cohen,Domhnall Gleeson,Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters completes the cast.The story was set from 1951 to 1952.A young Irish immigrant woman goes to New York City particularly Brooklyn.She tries to look for a job and then falls in love with someone.In the end,her past comes through her and she must make a choice between her former country and that of the United States.This is a wonderful bittersweet movie.Ronan does a wonderful portrayal of Lacey that we see her character mature and develop as the story progress.Added to that,we also find the events of her life truly affirming and amazing particularly for the joy and pain the she experiences despite how simple her life is in America.Her emotional life journey is definitely a must-see."
BROOKLYN,23 December 2020,7/10,"Saoirse Ronan is a young Irish girl who emigrates to America in the 1950s. She arrives knowing nobody, but fortunately finds work in an upmarket department store whilst lodging with a reputable lady (Julie Walters). She meets the gorgeous Emory Cohen (""Tony"") who has dreams of starting his own construction company, his idealism empowers her own personality and their life seems set fair. Suddenly, however, she must return to Ireland to deal with some family matters and her character faces a myriad of choices as she must try to reconcile the old with the new - and Domhnall Gleeson (""Jim"" ) only further complicates an already intricately balanced scenario. That scenario, in itself, is nothing new or complex - it's the stunningly delicate, charming and powerful performance from Ronan that shines brightly, here. She - as does Cohen - acts with the eye; the expression - both deliver nuanced performances that depict the best of human nature despite plenty of pressures - distance, family, gossiping neighbours etc. that could easily compromise the integrity of their personalities. Gleeson is also good, as is Walters who provides a gentle, but crucial anchor for the young stranger in Brooklyn. The overall look of the film is engagingly authentic and Michael Brook's score provides a delightful accompaniment to this stylish and captivating adaptation of Colm Tóibín's story of optimism, determination and love."
BROOKLYN,7 November 2015,9/10,"Ofthe nine reviews below not one is out-and-out negative so that we are left with a mixture of raves and qualified raves. For me a subtle touch was the namechecking of Jack Ford's The Quiet Man, actually released around the time Brroklyn is set so that theoretically The Quiet Man should have set the bar - especially as it was shot largely on location in Ireland - but as it stands it is Brooklyn that offers a more realistic portrayal of the auld country. As virtually everyone remarked the story/plot is laid out on Poundstore tissue paper but as I've had occasion to note before, it's all in the wrist, and here cast and crew combine to oxygenate a fairly run-of-the-mill love story just as Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard did in Brief Encounter. In my case the screenplay carried me right through the first two thirds, as we made the journey with Eilish from her melancholy farewell to her roots, her homesickness, gradual settling down, both falling and finding love, to the moment we feel the rug being pulled from under our feet by what can only be described as a group of evil conspirators, uniting to coerce-cum- blackmail Eilish into remaining in Ireland and erasing all memory of her husband who is head and shoulders above the would-be husband back home. At this point I would cheerfully have lined the entire community against a wall and machine-gunned them, which is not exactly the reaction one wants in what is essentially a feel good movie. Thankfully Eilish has acquired backbone and makes the overwhelmingly right decision. A fine film with an outstanding lead performance."
BROOKLYN,19 November 2016,6/10,"Ireland, early-1950s. Eilis Lacey is a young woman working in a grocery shop. She has greater ambitions and moves to Brooklyn, New York, leaving her mother and sister, Rose, behind. She is terribly homesick but eventually settles down, finding a job, studying to be a bookkeeper and meeting a nice young man, Tony. Things are going well but then she learns that Rose has died, and decides to return to Ireland, temporarily. She and Tony hastily get married and then she sets off back to Ireland, alone. Life is about to complicated...Sweet film, but not anywhere near as profound as it takes itself. The set up was good and Eilis's finding happiness in New York was quite heart-warming.The warmness and sweetness of the first half of the movie was enhanced by a wonderful performance by Saoirse Ronan. She imbues Eilis with great vulnerability, self-reliance, sweetness and likability. However, the warmth and potential of the first half is mostly negated by the second half. Here the plot gets clumsy and contrived. A secret that shouldn't have been a secret and an implausible love triangle become the main plot devices of the second half. Instead of being engaged by Eilis's new-found happiness mixed with tragedy we have a convoluted, implausible soap opera unfolding. Ending was reasonably emotional, but the Ireland sojourn definitely took the shine off the movie."
BROOKLYN,2 December 2015,9/10,""" . . . is worth a pub owner . . . "" you can learn the rest of accountant ""Eilis'"" calculations if you see BROOKLYN. When Eilis leaves her native Ireland for the Golden Shores of our USA in 1952, she's morbidly homesick for awhile. However, once her parish priest and immigration sponsor pays for her to learn the American Art of Double-Entry Bookkeeping, everything comes up Roses for the not-as-fertile-as-one-might-expect Irish girl. Perhaps another veiled call for Reform in Today's marriage laws, BROOKLYN does a deft job of filling in every painstaking detail of a World in which it was not considered kosher to have one husband in America, and another in Ireland--even if you loved both men equally, and were willing to spend six months or so annually in each country. Women caught in such a situation were face with the barbaric prospect of being forced to choose one guy or the other (and, consequently, one country as a primary home base). Even today, many Hollywood actresses with the means of taking on two or more husbands (even if their spouses' lines of work are NOT as lucrative as plumbing or bar-owning) are brow-beaten by their agents and publicists to enjoy their great loves serially, rather than simultaneously (in any official sense). Few will be able to watch BROOKLYN, and STILL believe that this is the Right Call."
BROOKLYN,30 November 2015,10/10,"BROOKLYN (2015) **** Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jane Brennan, Jim Broadbent, Fiona Glascott, Julie Walters, Emily Bett Rickards, Eve Macklin, Nora-Jane No one, Jessica Pare, Jenn Murray. Ronan shines as an Irish émigré fresh off the boat in New York's titular borough circa 1950s whose wallflower appearance betrays her inner spirit, strength and intelligence as she acclimates to her new home while pining for her close knit family abroad. While making her radical adjustments including the rooming home run by Walters' humorous crone, she finds the unlikely kindred spirit in the form of local Italian plumber Cohen (suggesting James Franco without the snark) whose romantic inclinations gets the best of her (and for the best in her too). Based on Colm Tolbin's novel (who co-scripted his adaptation with Nick Hornby) the storyline is at once familiar and fresh thanks largely to the wonderful direction by John Crowley and impeccable production design by Francois Seguin with vivid music scoring by Michael Brook. But it's largely due to a tremendous star turn by on the rise Ronan who cements the film with her terribly empathetic and sublimely beautiful performance of a young woman coming to grips with her life choices no matter the costs; heart breaking and fulfilling simultaneously. One of the year's best films."
BROOKLYN,16 May 2016,9/10,"""Brooklyn"" is a gentle mist of a movie, and it's one of the most romantic I've seen in a long time.Saoirse Ronan, in a luminous performance that gets better and better the more times you see it and the longer you think about it, plays Ellis, a young Irish woman who comes to New York in the early 1950s for the opportunities to live an independent life that her small-town Irish village won't give her. She has to deal with homesickness and the guilt of leaving behind an older sister who will have to single-handedly carry the burden of caring for their mother. The movie is about the conflict between a safe, comfortable life where everything may be dull but at least familiar; and a new one that may be a little scary but has the excitement of being of one's own choosing. The film is like life, and this conflict plays out as such things do in reality, quietly and internally. This isn't a movie of big dramatic moments, because life isn't a movie. Both of Ellis's options would give her at least a decent, comfortable life. But only one will allow her to feel that she's living her own life rather than one being lived for her by others.The movie has an old Hollywood quality to it, and it's deeply romantic. It plays like a fairy tale if you took out everything magical but left the tone and sentiment. It's a really wonderful movie.Grade: A"
BROOKLYN,22 January 2016,9/10,"Eilis (pronounced ""Ailish"") has an unrewarding part-time job as a shop assistant for poisonous Miss Kelly in 1951 small-town Ireland. Her sister Rose arranges for the church to take her to New York where a better future awaits her. After some severe homesickness, finding a boyfriend helps Eilis settle down. But a crisis takes her back home, and maybe she will have to make some hard choices.This is a fairly slight story. There are conflicts which drive it along nicely: the initial journey to the USA, homesickness, the other girls at the boarding house, developments with the boyfriend, the crisis which takes Eilis back to Ireland and what subsequently transpires. They are all major in Eilis' life, but minor insofar as they are the sort of hiccups which life throws up for all of us. And that is the joy of this film – big emotions delivered in small packages.All the players are good. Julie Walters as landlady Mrs Keogh is a hoot, and Brid Kelly in the small part of shopkeeper Miss Kelly is superbly vile. But this is Saoirse Ronan's film, from the first frame to the last. Just 20 while the film was in production, she delivers a masterclass of film acting, conveying complex emotions effortlessly. There is a scene relatively early on which concentrates on a close-up of her face for some time, and you can follow the mixture of thoughts which are going through her with no dialogue at all.This is a warm film, full of compassion and heart."
BROOKLYN,19 November 2015,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. A popular proverb ""Home is where the heart is"" is filled with truth  unless the heart belongs in two places. Such is the case with Ellis, an Irish girl who leaves behind her family and homeland to discover the new world opportunities afforded by 1950's America. The film is based on the popular and critically-acclaimed novel from Colm Toibin, and is directed by John Crowley (Is Anybody There? 2008) with a screenplay from Nick Hornby (About a Boy, An Education). It's a blend of romance, drama, and self-discovery, while also examining a couple of diverse cultures from lands separated by more than 3000 miles (and a big ocean).Saoirse Ronan plays Ellis in a performance that is sure to garner much Oscar talk. It's only been 8 years since Ms. Ronan exploded onto the screen as 13 year old Briony in Atonement. In this current role we watch her blossom like a flower as she grows from a timid and reserved shop girl with a bleak future in Ireland, to a fully-realized woman with much spirit and hope. On that journey, she experiences many life obstacles including seasickness, homesickness, catty and envious housemates, heartbreak and romantic awkwardness  all while dealing with the overwhelming nature of her new world.Director Cowley makes some interesting visual choices. We begin with a muted color palette and mostly close camera shots of Ellis' life in Ireland. This ""closed in"" feeling continues through her crossing of the Atlantic. However, once she steps through the blue doors of Ellis Island, the world opens up with wide shots and shocks of bright colors. These contrasts blend together in the third segment where Ellis returns to Ireland after a family tragedy. The look of the film at any given time mirrors the mood and circumstance of our lead character.Ellis struggles to adjust to the United States, both in the bordering house run by the colorful Ms. Kehoe (a terrific Julie Walters), and in the ritzy Bartocci store where she clerks for a demanding supervisor (Jessica Pare', ""Mad Men""). Ms. Kehoe provides her girls with such life guidance as ""Giddiness is the 8th Deadly Sin"". It doesn't take long for Ellis to meet Tony (a breakout performance by Emory Cohen, The Place Beyond the Pines), a pleasant and polite local Italian plumber who is enchanted by her. Their time together provides a wonderful comparison piece for today's courtship vs. that of the 1950's.The movie is beautifully paced, filmed and acted; however, there are some issues to fight through with the story and details of the main character. Her return to Ireland introduces Jim Ferrell (solid work from the ever-evolving Domhnall Gleeson), and just like that, Ellis is confused about Tony's line: ""This is where your life is"". This time of confusion for her, creates similar type confusion for viewers as we either understand her uncertainty, or question it. This distracts a bit from some of the impactful elements like her transition from clueless fish-out-of-water on her first cruise, to strong mentor for an Irish girl much like her younger self on a later trip. The script has more than a few of these moments of gold, and Saoirse brilliantly nails each."
BROOKLYN,25 January 2016,9/10,"Brooklyn (2015): Dir: John Crowley / Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters: They say that home is where you hang your hat. Saoirse Ronan plays a young Irish woman sent to Brooklyn to go to college and work as a book keeper. Her mother is widowed and overseen by her sister. The year is 1952 and Ronan is home sick after a rough boating trip to Brooklyn. Ronan delivers perhaps her greatest performance as she tearfully moves away and eventually finds romance and then having to return home once again when tragedy strikes. Emory Cohen plays a young Italian plumber who strikes up a romance with Ronan. He insists that she meet his family who is not a fan of the Irish. Domhnall Gleeson plays a young bachelor whom Ronan encounters upon her return home. She was married to Cohen in secret before returning but is pulled towards this new bachelor at the urge of a friend who is about to be married herself. She quits reading letters from her husband as she is conflicted by her family's beliefs. Jim Broadbent appears as a priest who provides financial aid and the promising start of college and work. There is a host of scene stealing supporting roles but what director John Crowley captures best is the image of 1952 Brooklyn right down to hair styles and clothing. Theme regards what we make of where we are placed in life. Ronan struggles despite aiming at a promising future. Despite how depressing this sounds she is young but grows up quickly to realize that her Irish background is meant to be sealed away while Brooklyn looks more like home in its closing scene. Score: 9 / 10"
BROOKLYN,17 December 2015,10/10,"Saoirse Ronan gives such a believable and moving performance here that she deserves the awards for best actress in a drama for it in the upcoming award season. Every emotion from love to loneliness, from doubt and fickleness to happiness is perfectly conveyed. Her tears are the best tears shed on screen I have seen in a long time.A young Irish girl moves to Brooklyn to find a better life. She misses her sister and mother terribly. She finds love with an Italian plumber well played by Emory Cohen. But when she goes back to Ireland for a funeral she faces a very real dilemma and a difficult choice.The insightful story deftly portrays the emotional complexities of a woman's heart and the pain of leaving home for a new country. It's refreshing to see people on screen showing kindness on the way on the ship and in the boarding house. The climax about whether to do the right and honorable thing is resolved in a believable and satisfying way. An insightful theme is small town mentality vs the New World.""Brooklyn"" is more memorable and affecting than many of the big budge movies this year. A must watch."
BROOKLYN,18 March 2016,,"Place two very fine authors side by side – in this case Nick Hornsby (An Education, About a Boy) who adapted the popular novel by the same name by Colm Tóibín (The Backwater Lightship) - and place it in the sure hands of a fine director John Crowley and the result is one of the more sensitive exploration of love and immigrants to be seen on the screen. The story is deceptively simple –a struggle of a young poor Irish girl who wants to better herself and believes that moving to the US will allow that - but the underlying psychological lessons abound, making this a film not only satisfying the entertainment value but also producing some serous thought about problems we all face. An Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) leaves her mother Mary (Jane Brennan) and sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) and lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local Italian boy Tony (Emory Cohen) and learns the ins and outs of working in a department story but maintains the goal of being a bookkeeper. She lives in a boarding house run by the strict but hilarious Mrs. Keogh (Julie Walters), navigates becoming a dating woman, agrees to marry Tony, but when a priest (Jim Broadbent) notifies her that her sister has suddenly died she returns to Ireland where she falls in love with an Irish lad (Domhnall Gleeson). When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.Rich in Gaelic charm and a fine examination between immigrant families (Irish and Italian) in Brooklyn, the film sings."
BROOKLYN,5 January 2016,7/10,"Thoroughly pleasant, with a very good lead performance by Saorsie Ronan, but that's about it. The whole film feels very inconsequential, like I could hardly believe someone read this novel and thought ""Wow, this would make a great movie!"" There's no real conflict. Emory Cohen, who plays Ronan's American love interest, is so nice he's kind of boring. The second half of the film introduces a love triangle with the ubiquitous Domhnall Gleeson, but he's really boring, too. Certainly not among the notable films of the year, and, frankly, as good as Ronan is, this wouldn't even be in my top 5 of her performances and she doesn't really deserve to be in the Oscar conversation, either (still, I like her so much I wouldn't argue with it)."
BROOKLYN,16 March 2016,,"In a fascinating set of behind-the-scenes bonus segments from the DVD of ""Brooklyn,"" the viewer meets the cast, director, novelist, and screenwriter. One is immediately struck by the actors speaking about the roles, yet looking nothing like their characters. Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, and Domhnall Gleeson were virtually unrecognizable when compared to their screen characters. Much credit belongs to the director of photography, hair stylists, and lighting designer for the remarkable transformations.At the center of this film is the incandescent presence of Saoirse Ronan as an Irish immigrant to New York in the early 1950s. Ronan's character of Eilis Lacey courageously travels by boat alone and resides at a boardinghouse in Brooklyn, while working in a department store. The mundane details of her life are made both real and dynamic, as we see a stunning arc of development in her character.While much of the film concerns Eilis's romantic involvement with two men, the focus of the film is on the dynamic of the challenges and hurdles of an immigrant. The film transcends its 1950s setting and the context of a young Irish woman to speak across the ages about how difficult it is for any immigrant to adapt to a new culture.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: Some viewers may be surprised that on Eilis's return trip to Ireland, she seriously contemplates renouncing her marriage to the likable Tony Fiorello and committing bigamy with the young Irish man Jim Farrell. But one of the film's deleted scenes offers a poignant soliloquy spoken by Eilis over the grave of her recently deceased sister. In the speech, Eilis makes it clear that her prime motivation for possibly remaining in Ireland would be to care for her aging mother. This is one prime example of a deleted scene that, if restored, would offer greater integrity to character motivation and action.While the film is a lyrical expression of the indomitable spirit of the young immigrant, ""Brooklyn"" is an excellent starting point for discussing the controversial topic of immigration. A good companion film is ""The Immigrant"" (2013), starring Marion Cotillard, and exploring the same theme from a tragic, as opposed to sentimental and heartwarming, perspective."
BROOKLYN,27 December 2015,9/10,"Based on Colm Tóibín's novel of the same name, 'Brooklyn' is A Beautiful, Beautiful Film! A heartwarming tale about Love, Loss & Relationships. And a Knock-Out Performance by Saoirse Ronan is always welcome.'Brooklyn' Synopsis: An Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a new romance. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.'Brooklyn' is a simple film, told magnificently. Its superior film in all respects. Nick Hornby's Adapted Screenplay captures the Protagonist's coming-of-age tale, with dignity & pathos. I was arrested by the flow of the narrative. John Crowley's Direction is excellent. Cinematography & Editing are sharp, while the Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Michael Brook's Score works.Performance-Wise: Saoirse Ronan is in great form.

The Ever-Compelling Jim Broadbent shines in a brief role.On the whole, 'Brooklyn' is a true winner. Don't miss it!"
BROOKLYN,24 November 2015,,"""Home is home."" Tony (Emory Cohen) In a beautiful and sentimental film called Brooklyn, two loves dominate: love of Ireland and Brooklyn, love of one man in Ireland and love of another in America. Behind it is the longing to make a home in a new world or return to a home one knows.The longing for each of these elements forms the conflict for young Eilis (Saiorse Ronan), an Irish girl who strikes out in the 1950's for America and a better life only to experience profound home sickness that makes her see how good her life had been.""Homesickness is like most sicknesses. It will pass."" Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) Before you decide on any current immigration reform proposals, see Brooklyn and discover the powerful pull of our great country and yet the sacrifice an immigrant makes, especially giving up the simpler life on the beautiful Emerald Isle. This rewarding story of Eilis's decisions, difficult and almost painful as they are, satisfies with insight about the joys and sorrows of seeking a newer world.There's even a subplot about Father Flood, who helps Eilis come to America and adjust. The benign, compassionate prelate does much to readjust attitudes toward the currently-exposed pedophiliac Church as it reminds us of the good the Church can do despite its rogue priests.The film belongs to Ms. Ronan, whose projection of a not-so-extremely beautiful girl with brains and a very big heart should earn her an Oscar nomination. As her character develops, she goes from introverted and scared to expressive and bold. Director John Crowley makes sure she is never more glamorous than most of the other girls to show that she is always about substance and not surface.It's not all about the Irish, for the sequence at her Italian love's family table is as good as you'll get for love, playfulness, and a wisecracking little eight-year-old brother you'll want to see again. If the Academy should amazingly not nominate Ronan for best actress, I guarantee you'll not forget her sweet and tough performance."
BROOKLYN,26 November 2015,8/10,"Young love is one of the most beautiful things when it's working, but one of the ugliest things when it's suffering or stunted by circumstance. I've personally known friends in high school in serious relationships that spanned more than four or five years and that always hits me hard. At that age, cutting and running when things get tough is almost too easy, leaving your dirty laundry as a burden with someone you formerly had feeling for so another person can air it out, and the person in question can suffer more and trust less. When I see a relationship isn't bound by the law of marriage and is held together by emotional honesty and incorruptible loyalty from both parties, it is one of the most inspiring things for myself.When the two main characters in ""Brooklyn"" are in love, or at least infatuated with one another, it is some of the most romantic moments in film I've seen all year. But when things between the two leads become cloudy and uncertain, it is some of the saddest moments in film I've seen all year.Such is young love, especially when you're a woman who calls two places, with one being in the United States and the other being across the Atlantic Ocean, home. The film revolves around Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) in 1952, a young Irish girl who leaves behind Ireland for a better future in Brooklyn per the demands of her older sister Rose (Fiona Glascott). After a miserable train ride involving sickness, diarrhea, and discomfort, Eilis arrives in the land of opportunities. In the meantime, she lives in a boarding house, works in an expensive jewelry store to earn pocket money, and attends a nightly bookkeeping class.Soon enough, Eilis meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), a young Italian boy, at an Irish dance. Tony attends these dances because he has an insatiable desire for Irish girls and Eilis catches his eye right away. With that, the two wind up hanging out, going on dates, and eventually dating, despite the general stereotype of the friction between the Irish and Italians. Everything is going smoothly until Eilis is forced to go back home to Ireland for a brief time, forcing to leave Tony behind and tempted by the wealth of cushy dating and employment opportunities back home where she is closer to family.While ""Brooklyn"" has its fair share of emotionally manipulative sequences, mainly because the film's score is frequently overbearing and excessive, its nuances and insights into young love and how one person can almost entirely make one's fears and uncertainties about an area and their situation simply evaporate are considerably powerful. The scenes between Eilis and Tony are undeniably romantic and not overblown or incredulously depicted, as they are in your run-of-the-mill Nicholas Sparks novel. The two exude a very natural chemistry that is buoyed by their innocence and their clearly authentic smiles and affection for one another; to put it simply, if you're single and seeing this film alone, as I did, you'll be wishing you are walking out with someone special by your side at the end of it.Writer Nick Hornby (""High Fidelity"") and director John Crowley also show a considerable amount of restrain in terms of evoking comedic circumstances in the film. Consider the scene when Eilis sits down to meet Tony's full-blooded Italian family over a spaghetti dinner, a scene ripe for stale comedic possibilities about the passive-aggressiveness Italians had towards Irish people and vice-versa. Instead, Hornby conducts the scene in a manner that's thoroughly pleasant and even wryly comedic at times, thanks to great timing and strong respect for logic and narrative seriousness.Saoirse Ronan, who has arguably gone from paying her dues in overwrought and unbearable films like ""The Host"" and ""The Lovely Bones,"" really commands the screen here largely due to her character's commonality and her natural, radiant presence. Ronan reminds of Jennifer Lawrence, specifically in ""American Hustle,"" largely because her appearance, acting talents, and personality seem to echo a woman much older and more experienced than herself. This isn't necessarily the easiest role for any actor, as it requires the right amount of communication in the way of alienation, romance, and uncertainty, yet Ronan doesn't seem too fazed to mind or slip up.""Brooklyn"" is a timely film in many respects, largely because the issue of immigration and acceptance of different races, religions, and ethnic backgrounds aren't getting minimized any time soon, and the ideas of young love and handling complex emotions without prior experience are intriguing and layered concepts to profile on film. For a romance as simple as this one, it certainly has more complicated layers that do not take a backseat in the way of schmaltz. If modern romance films wanted to be half as interesting as most of them are, they'd assume a style and level of sustenance, whilst simultaneously remaining true to their genre, as ""Brooklyn."""
BROOKLYN,16 January 2016,8/10,"""Brooklyn"" is one of those films that you watch and see how everyone has a dream and that each and everyone wants to find a new life and a new beginning.

BROOKLYN,2 March 2016,8/10,"From the Irish director who has made BOY A (2007), John Crowley's latest feature BROOKLYN is a three-time Oscar nominee (including BEST PICTURE and BEST LEADING ACTRESS), a tailor-made immigration drama for Saoirse Ronan, who plays Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman from Enniscorthy in 1952, who gets a chance to emigrate to America by virtue of the correspondence between her beloved elder sister Rose (Glascott) and Father Flood (Broadbent) in New York.The seafaring journey takes its toll on Eilis, the first-time traveler, she has to adopt a new life with other young girls in the boarding house run by Madge Kehoe (Walters) in Brooklyn and homesick is the incubus she must endure every day. But Eilis is a smart girl, soon she becomes the favourite of Ms. Kehoe, enrols in the bookkeeping classes, and gets familiar with her day time job as a saleswoman in a department store, but most importantly, she meets Tony (Cohen), an Italian boy whom she meets in an Italian ball. The simple and good-natured Tony charms her, they starts a relationship, life reveals its kaleidoscopic facets to Eilis in the booming land, America becomes an Elysium for an immigrant.But a tragedy occurs out of the blue in her family in Ireland, to comfort her beleaguered mother, Eilis decides to go back and right before her departure, the two lovebirds get married in secrecy. Back in her hometown, Eilis unexpectedly realises that many previously unavailable opportunities emerge, and her New York background does ameliorate her image among local folks, a dream job opportunity and a prosperous suitor Jim Farrell (Gleeson) both pop up. Eilis is at the crossroad of her life, should she stay or should she return?BROOKLYN excels in its frankness and sincerity of demonstrating human feelings, the affection between Eilis and Tony is so genuine and fulfilling to watch, that's how true love happens to two people, the Ronan-and-Cohen pair incredibly stokes great admiration for their chemistry and acting faculty. Also, Ronan is extremely poignant in leavening her yearning of home in the first half of the movie, shows no stage fright under the prolonged close-ups, and indisputably it is her maturest performance to date (it is gracious to see finally a past Oscar-nominated child prodigy is able to safely transform into a competent adult player in the 21st century). Plus, the ever-so- amazing Julie Walters upstages her costars in her chirpiness and sharp tongue, which leaves a uneasy void due to her absence after the midstream.A major incoherence in the otherwise remarkable narrative arises when audience is shown that Eilis keeps all Tony's letters from New York unopened when she is back in Ireland, and this causes some stirring because up to that moment, what the film has projected is that Eilis hasn't been swayed from her resolution to return in spite of all the changes around her. She plays along to please her mother (Jane Brennan), and carefully does not give any false hope to Jim, so since when she has steered to have a change of heart so dramatically? This deployment feels too rushed, adding Eilis' expedient decision after her secret being disclosed by the mean-spirited Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan), it all makes us wonder how strong is Eilis' devotion to Tony anyway? That is quite a grating thought if we have been investing all our empathy on her all the way through, and should be nipped in the bud."
BROOKLYN,10 December 2015,7/10,"'BROOKLYN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed historical drama flick; about a young Irish woman, that moves to Brooklyn from a small Ireland town, in the 1950s, to start a new life. It was directed by John Crowley and written by Nick Hornby; the script is based on the book, of the same name, by Colm Tóibín. The movie stars Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters. It's one of the best reviewed movies of the year, and it's also a (very likely) Academy Awards hopeful. I liked it, but I don't think it quite lives up to all of it's hype.Ronan plays Eilis Lacey; a young woman, who works every Sunday at a shop, in a small town in 1952 Ireland. Her older sister Rose (Fiona Glascott), has managed to arrange a trip to America for her; in hopes she'll find a better life there. After an unpleasant trip, Ellis arrives in Brooklyn (where most Irish immigrants went), and she finds housing at a boarding house there; with other young Irish women. She also gets a job at a department store; but she's extremely shy and unhappy. Ellis really begins regretting leaving home, until she meets a young Italian man, at a dance, named Tony (Cohen).The movie is a pretty well made period piece; it always looks nice, the acting is good and the characters are nicely developed. There's also a pretty positive message about learning to overcome your fears, and conquering your anxieties. It's also pretty boring though, and I had a really hard time sitting through it all. Obviously many others really enjoy it though, despite it's lame pacing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/CoUgbXLzKSQ"
BROOKLYN,16 January 2016,3/10,"As incredibly simple this movie was, I am puzzled on what I just saw. Maybe the reason is: why the hell did this get noticed at the Oscars?Every year, the Oscar Best Picture nomination list not only snubs great films, but it leaves open slots that could've been filled with some of the greats. (This year, only eight were nominated, when two more easily could've been found amongst some incredible works.) Additionally, I always see at least one or two WTF choices in which I thought were enormously below average or down right terrible.Mercifully, this isn't terrible, but it does fit the WTF category. It's justthere. Nothing special about this. Sure, I believed the actors, believed they lived in both Brooklyn, New York and Ireland in the 50s. But, there wasn't much substance or depth I haven't seen on a PBS or lifetime movie back in the 90s. Ellis dreams of leaving her family and life in Ireland to make anew in New York. Slowly – and I use that term very lightly, she does, but then tragedy strikes and she has to choose between the countries.That's it. That's two hours of Ellis longing for both while blatantly leading everyone on around her. She's not mean about it – heck, she'd have to show some personality trait, that I never saw, to add some zest to this project. But, the truth is: she's the Bella Swan of the 1950s. She just looks longingly everywhere, forgets to smile and men just stumble over backwards to court her.There are movies for everyone. Maybe if you'd like to spend two hours watching an Irish immigrant making decisions, people gossiping around her and no real payoff, by all means: visit Brooklyn. But, at least, even though it has no shot at all at winning any Oscars, it might be for some older folk to marvel at as they remember the 1950's Brooklyn Irish craze."
BROOKLYN,12 April 2016,7/10,"A nice old-fashioned period love-story which I happily watched with my wife - and there aren't that many movies you can say that about.Set in the early 50's, a young Irish girl (Saoirse Ellis) gets the opportunity, through the offices a fellow-countryman priest (Jim Broadbent) to escape the poor, drab confines of her native County Cork and start a new life on her own in the bustling, cosmopolitan Brooklyn district of New York. Shy and homesick at first, she lodges with an Irish matriarch, played by Julie Walters along with a brood of similarly-placed girls of a similar age, some American and some Irish. Working in the local department store she meets a brash and unsophisticated Italian, with whom she falls in love before a family tragedy back in Ireland sees her return home where her loyalties to her Italian suitor and New York way of life are challenged by feelings of loyalty to her mother and stirrings for a prosperous and intelligent, if more staid, local Irish lad.There are no real surprises as the story unfolds and certainly not in the denouement, with no really big dramatic moments either to really stay in the memory, in fact her well-justified denunciation of her gossipy, old employer in Cork, is about as good as it gets in that respect. Instead, the viewer is compensated by a nice narrative, pleasant characters (perhaps too many of them in fact) and attractive period-settings. With a screenplay by Nick Hornby there are some droll moments of humour sprinkled occasionally on proceedings.Ellis gives a nice performance in the lead and old-stagers Broadbent and Walters do their customary good work in support. For a movie set in the 50's it could have actually been made in the same decade, which I didn't mind at all. Old-fashioned movie-making this may be, but my wife and I managed to overlook the Mills and Boone storyline enough to quite enjoy this dual-city romance."
BROOKLYN,11 August 2018,8/10,"The apparent (perhaps 'largest' or 'most obvious') central conflict - and, indeed, the supposed 'plot', as advertised and spoken about by pretty much everyone involved with its production - doesn't actually begin, in the strictest of senses, until the final third of 'Brooklyn (2015)', which leaves little room for this new, much more outward struggle and ultimately results in much of it seeming rather rushed and communicated somewhat ineffectively, especially considering that the tensions and temptations tearing our protagonist between her two homes often feel tenuous at best and that her choice, which is supposed to be a difficult and ambiguous one, actually ends up seeming rather obvious. The picture is actually much more of a character study than anything else, though, and certainly isn't marked solely by this late-edition plot-shift - though it's definitely solidified and enhanced by it. The film conveys itself through universal and surprisingly touching themes of home, heritage, love and the ever-evolving, unexpected nature of life itself. It comes together to become an incredibly endearing and entertaining experience that enchants as much as it emotionally affects, often making you long for a home you perhaps never had by letting you into the heart of a person who somehow doesn't really exist. 8/10"
BROOKLYN,18 November 2015,10/10,"Brian Friel's ""Philadelphia, Here I Come"" is still the great fictional work of the last 50 years or so to deal with the Irish Diaspora but Colm Toibin's ""Brooklyn"" runs it a close second. Sadly, the only film version of Friel's play was a somewhat dull affair, part of the American Film Theatre series. It preserved a great play but it wasn't much of a film, whereas John Crowley's screen version of Toibin's novel is as close to perfect as we are likely to get. It preserves the feel of the book, (thanks to a flawless adaptation by Nick Hornby), but this is also a real film; large, expansive, magical and one of the best films you are likely to see this year.It's the story of one young girl's awakening, to the world and to herself. She's Eilis and at the start of the film she is moving from her home town of Enniscorthy in Ireland's County Wexford to Brooklyn, a world away on the other side of the Atlantic. She goes at the behest of her sister, Rose so she might have a life that might otherwise be denied her back in Ireland. Homesick at first, she finally finds happiness with a hugely likable and very handsome Italian boy until a family tragedy forces her to return to Ireland.It's a simple tale, made complex by conflicting emotions and a welter of detail. It's funny and sad and bursting with life. Brooklyn is a place of happiness and giving; Enniscorthy a place of sadness and resentment, though on Eilis' return, a fuller and more confident woman, it too offers the potential for happiness in the form of a new job and, more crucially, a new boyfriend. This return also offers a quandary; should she stay or return to Brooklyn, as well as an ending more tinged with sadness than might appear on the surface.Nothing about this wonderful film can be faulted, (except perhaps the appalling trailer that's doing the rounds). The period detail is superb, beautifully captured in Yves Belanger's gorgeous cinematography, (the costumes are crucial and they are perfect). Here is a period piece, (it's set in 1952), that could have been made in the year in which it's set and the director, John Crowley, imbues it with great feeling.Best of all, it's superlatively acted down to the smallest part. Roles that are basically clichés, (the kindly landlady in the US, the parish priest, the bitchy shopkeeper back in Ireland), are beautifully fleshed out by Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Brid Brennan. Still smaller parts, (the girls Eilis encounters on her journey, the Italian boy's family, her mother and sister), are all fully developed by a brilliant cast but it's the three central performances that are truly great and award-worthy.As the boys who basically change Eilis' life, in one way or another, Emory Cohen in America and Domhnall Gleeson in Ireland, are terrific. Cohen, (a much more handsome, young Rod Steiger), has a real future ahead of him while Gleeson is fast overtaking his father as Ireland's finest actor. And then there is Saoirse Ronan as Eilis; the greatness of her performance lies in as much in what she's not doing or saying as in what she does. She has one of the most expressive faces in the movies and it's in the moments of silence that she really comes into her own and it's one of the great pleasures of recent cinema watching her character develop. Surely she must be a front-runner at this year's Oscars. This is a film both for now and for posterity. See it at all costs."
BROOKLYN,22 November 2015,9/10,"Brooklyn is in many ways the romantic film Nicholas Sparks wishes he wrote. It deals with pretty much every aspect his films/books usually have, romance, tragedy, love triangles, all of it. But Brooklyn is told with care. Everything that happens makes sense thematically. There isn't some crazy twist or a MacGuffin thrown in at the end, it's simply a well thought out story about a young woman trying to find where she belongs. To me, that was really refreshing to see.Saoirse Ronan stars as Ellis, a young Irish woman whom doesn't seem to fit within the current formulaic lifestyle of that of her Irish family and friends. So she decides to take a trip to New York and find herself with a hopeful career in bookkeeping and accounting. In Brooklyn she meets a young Italian man which blossoms into a relationship. Ronan is fantastic as Ellis and is sure to be up there for best lead actress come Oscar season. Her performance is one of perfect comedic and emotional timing. I think that's probably the best part about the film. It knows when to hit you with laughs and it finds just the right time for tears.Ellis has to deal with a tragedy back home so she goes back to Ireland around the midway point of the film. This is where the film could go into the clichéd and cheesy territory as a second love interest arises back home. Except, this is once again handled with care. As Ellis is torn, so are we. It's an age old tale about the right choice not necessarily being the best choice. I really thought Ronan balanced that extremely well in her performance. It's also a strong female role. Her choices in the film aren't solely based on men. She does what she does to further her cause as well and has her own dreams and aspirations. Brooklyn is truly a hidden gem of 2015 and will definitely be talked about come Oscar season.+Roman is so strong+Powerful love story not solely predicated on love+Comedic and emotional timing+Performances across the board9.2/10"
BROOKLYN,18 December 2015,,"There's something truly special about Brooklyn. It's even more incredible considering the kind of film it is, a sentimental, period film, something I usually dread. But its sentimentality is both undeniably irresistible and part of what makes it a different experience from any other 2015 film. There were a lot of great films in 2015, but only Brooklyn stands as one where it creates a world that I've been able to get lost in every single time I've seen it. So many times I'm watching a great film and analyzing every single aspect of it, to the point that watching films sometimes becomes part of a process that can get kind of dull. I overanalyze and I tend to look at the filmmaking aspects, sometimes to the detriment of the enjoyment I should be getting. It's something that I've been trying to work on. Brooklyn was the one film from 2015 that I never had that problem with. I was never less than fully engaged with just the storyline and the characters. It's the characters that did it for me, characters that I grew to love and wanted to be in the company of. It's a film that easily grabbed me emotionally and so, instead of analyzing it to the core, I have always just been able to enjoy it. I think it's both the most rewatchable and the most purely entertaining, captivating film of 2015.Much of why Brooklyn works so well is due to its carefully structured, accessible yet beautifully old-fashioned screenplay. Much has been said about the quality of its second half, but on rewatches I was able to appreciate so much more of what the film did that on first viewing perhaps left me a bit disappointed. But the film, as great as its other aspects are, does live or die on the strength of its actors, and boy do they deliver. Every time I see Brooklyn I become more enchanted by what Ronan did with the role. It looks like an ""easy"" role, certainly compared to Larson or Rampling's. But there's so much expression in her work. There's so much natural charisma, warmth, nuance... so much magic that she infuses the role with. There's something so tremendous in her, especially considering how unshowy the role is. It's such phenomenal, powerful work that it sort of ceases to be ""acting"". She so fully inhabits that character that she breathes and lives and sucks you in without noticing what she's doing. Both her and Cohen make you want to live in that world, be there with them, spend time with them. They make it more than just a film, but an experience to remember.To conclude, I'm in complete love with the film. It's nice to have a film that isn't cynical, that isn't preoccupied with escaping the old Hollywood tradition. I think that's why it stands apart from many of the other films I usually take to. Because it's just so not my usual thing. For that, it's both distinct and unique, and for that I cherish it."
BROOKLYN,18 January 2016,,"Crafted with care, told with elegance & resonating a deep sense of warmth throughout its runtime, Brooklyn is the story of an immigrant that beautifully illustrates the struggles faced when trying to adjust in a new environment with people you don't know & places you aren't familiar with, and not only does it work as a wonderful coming-of-age drama but also succeeds as a pleasant love story.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Brooklyn takes place during the early 1950s and follows a young Irish immigrant who leaves her hometown to seek a better future in the titular town of New York where, after struggling for a while, she manages to bring some stability in her life. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes back home, she's forced to confront her past and make a hard choice.Directed by John Crowley, the plot is divided into three segments with the first one focusing on her inexperience & the difficult time she endures during her initial days in the new country. The second segment covers her life in Brooklyn and the different things she experiences there while the last one brings her back to the place she went away from where circumstances compel her to make a decision that will alter her life.Written by Nick Hornby, the movie tackles the issues faced by immigrants in a lightweight manner plus the characters are quite compelling. The set pieces are reminiscent of the timeline it tries to depict, Cinematography uses different colour tones for each segment and its bright lighting keeps the ambiance more inviting. Editing unravels the plot in a controlled way and pace is never hurried. Plus, all the period drama elements are nicely handled.Coming to the performances, Brooklyn packs a fine cast in Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters & others, and all of them are convincing in their given roles. Effortlessly stealing the show is Ronan who carries the whole film all by herself plus her excellent performance is this flick's real highlight. Cohen & Gleeson chip in with fine supporting work while Walters is a treat to watch even if her appearance is quite brief.On an overall scale, Brooklyn is a heartwarming, captivating & fulfilling movie that's as much about growing up & finding your identity in life as it is about love & relationships, is powered by a strong lead performance from Saoirse Ronan, and addresses its universal themes in a sensible manner. Expertly directed, deftly written, exquisitely photographed, patiently edited, consistently paced & aptly scored, Brooklyn is one of the better films of 2015 and is definitely worth a shot."
BROOKLYN,27 December 2018,8/10,"Brooklyn is a well-made film, but it seems odd to me that it was nominated for Best Picture. This movie is, essentially, a more dramatic version of Sweet Home Alabama. Nevertheless, Saoirse Ronan is outstanding in her role as Eilis, and the supporting cast is a delight to watch, as well. 'Tis a fine Irish film!"
BROOKLYN,13 October 2016,8/10,"Brooklyn is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic cast. It is a very heartwarming drama that I am not afraid to admit had me shedding tears on several occasions. Saoirse Ronan portrays the emotions of someone leaving home very eloquently, we can both emphasis and relate with her, the heart and soul of her country is present throughout. On the other hand, I did find it weaker by the final half, which is what brought it down from a nine to an eight for me. We are following Eilis in her new life and discovering this new world with her, so when she returns home the entire formula that made this appealing and engrossed us in the first place is lost. The chemistry between Ronan and Emory Cohen is the highlight for me, it is very natural and sweet. The connection between them is instant, nothing is forced about it, we never feel as if either of them are acting, which is also why the second half fell flat for me, as this element was lost. It is a movie about moving away and leaving what we are used to, I feel anyone watching this movie can relate to this, which is what makes it such an effective viewing. Simple and charming storytelling, Brooklyn is small on scale, but big on performances, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. A young girl decides to move to America, away from her family in Ireland, she soon finds love with a local New Yorker. Best Performance: Saoirse Ronan"
BROOKLYN,25 August 2021,7/10,"It's a bit of an exaggerated movie, but still good.Give Saoirse Ronan an Oscar award."
BROOKLYN,14 December 2015,8/10,"Eilis (Saorise Ronan) lives in fifties Ireland with her widowed mother and unmarried older sister, Rose. Both girls are smart and sensitive but while Rose has a great job as a bookkeeper, Eilis' options are limited. At present, she works for the Irish Wicked Witch, Miss Kelly, in a small grocery store. There is no future there. So, her sister contacts a priest she knows in America (Jim Broadbent) who has helped many Irish immigrants. Eilis is to travel to Brooklyn for a job in a fine department store and will have a room in an upright boarding house run by an Irish matron (Julie Walters). Since there are few choices, Eilis boards the boat. She is seasick and homesick immediately. If not for a fellow kind passenger, she would have suffered the journey greatly. Once in Brooklyn, the Irish maiden is depressed, although she works hard and tries to adapt. Its not until a friendly Italian-American, Tony (Emory Cohen) befriends her and takes her out that she feels any differently about her new home. Tony, the proverbial nice guy, gives her a better reason to live and they become quite close. Alas, a tragedy at home sends Eilis back to Ireland after a year has passed. Tony is worried that she will not come back. Indeed, once back in Ireland, Eilis accidentally meets another gentleman, Jim (Dohmnall Gleeson) who casts his attention of her, too. So, with two suitors, which will Eilis choose? Will it matter if one is in her beloved Ireland while the other is in the New World, which is just not the same? This lovely period piece is a rich experience for fans of quality film making. The actors are wonderful, especially Ronan and newcomer Cohen, the latter who resembles James Franco in a big way. Then, too, the re-creation of life in the fifties, through sets, costumes, script and careful direction is also an eye-filling wonder. Film fans, if 2015 has been bereft of the movies you prefer, that is romantic dramas or family tales, here is your heart's desire just in time for the holidays."
BROOKLYN,10 February 2016,8/10,"""Homesickness is like most sicknesses. It'll make you feel wretched and it'll move on to somebody else."" Eilis (Ronan) is struggling in Ireland and wants to get out. After finally saving enough she take a boat to America. Little by little she builds a life in New York and is finally becoming the person she wants to be. When a tragedy sends her back to Ireland she becomes torn between the life she has built and the life she left. This is a really great movie. The acting is fantastic and the whole movie is just very well done and I can see why it's up for all the awards it is up for. On the other hand this really isn't a movie that I think I could watch more than once. It is a little slow in some parts, but not enough to make you bored or have your mind wander. This is a movie that just needs to be seen to understand how good it is. It may not be for everyone but if you're tired of the same type of movie over and over this is a great alternative. Overall, well deserving of all the award nominations and I recommend this if for no other reason the Ronan's acting. I give this a B+."
BROOKLYN,14 February 2016,7/10,"BrooklynThe reason why the Irish settled in Brooklyn was due to Manhattan's strict public intoxication laws.Surprisingly, the cailín in this romantic movie is a wee bit of a teetotaler.Sponsored by her family's former priest (Jim Broadbent), Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is able to leave Ireland behind and settle in Brooklyn, where she subsequently works in a shop.At a dance she meets - and later marries - Tony (Emory Cohen). But when she returns home for a funeral, she keeps her nuptials a secret so she can flirt with an eligible Irishman (Domhnall Gleeson).Complete with authentic Irish and annoying Brooklyn accents, this complex yet cottony coming- of-age love story is a sincere snapshot of 1950s New York, while Ronan simply embodies the naivety as well as the mixed emotions of becoming an American. Moreover, it reminds us that not all immigrants are terrorists; they're also letting in two-timing hussies. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
BROOKLYN,21 February 2016,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Brooklyn"" (2015) is what every Nicola's Sparks movie adaptation would like to be but fails (well except for ""The Notebook""). This is an old fashion movie with very clear and straightforward story which involved me from the beginning till the very last end. Saoirse Ronan (which didn't clicked very well for me before) does a magnificent job and best in her carrier so far by playing Eilis, a young and poor girl from Ireland who arrives to USA to work and to start a new life. By returning home she has to make a decision of her lifetime. I won't go into the details but this movie is simply the best romantic period drama i saw in many moons. It was not boring for a second, the story is simple yet gorgeously and clearly made. Perfromances were very great from all involved. Directing was very solid, movie does not drag for a second. Script was very plausible and realistic. Overall, ""Brooklyn"" is must see for everyone who likes good old fashioned romance movies. I'm not a fan of them to be honest, but this movie was superbly involving. Can't recommend more - this is definitely one of the best movies in 2015 - a very well deserved Oscar nominations here."
BROOKLYN,24 February 2016,9/10,"A very fascinating movie. Depicted as a real life drama that is totally different from the other Oscars nominees for this year. Based on the novel of the same name, that tells the story of a young Irish woman, Eilis, in the 1950s who travels to the United States, Brooklyn, looking for a better future. Thousands of kilometers across the Pacific ocean, she finds a new job, new friends, a whole new life, but what she misses is her home and family. So how she makes out of those difficulties, and finds a way to go forward is the rest.About an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us. That's why I loved this film more than other drama films nominated for this Oscar. The first two acts were amazing, the third was a bit off and cliché, but that's how the story rediscovered by getting back at the conclusion. I think this is Saoirse Ronan's full matured character as an adult woman. She was my favourite child actress and seen all her films. So felt strange to see her like this, because that's not how I remember her, but it only gets better after she does more character like this.She was very good, in fact, she should get the Oscar for the role. In my prediction, Brie Larson for 'Room' and Ronan are the top contenders, but if Cate Blanchett wins that'll be a great disappointment. I'm also expecting adapted screenplay awards. The cinematography was fantastic, those 50s New York City really brought back on the screen. It is a must watch, especially if you're a middle aged guy, because you're well experienced about personal and social life already, and this movie only a reminder.9/10"
BROOKLYN,21 February 2016,9/10,"A handsomely crafted love story that somehow manages to make the well-trodden grounds of the migrant drama feel not only fresh but frequently witty and heartfelt, Brooklyn is an adorable trip to both 1950's Ireland and New York City that's easily one of the year's most easy to like events.Nominated for 3 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actress at this year's upcoming Academy Awards ceremony, Boy A director John Crowley's film could've easily snuck into other award categories as he alongside famed screenwriter Nick Hornby and his on form cast have combined to give Brooklyn that special something that every now and then comes along in a genre that often feels predictable, slight and downright uninteresting, but from the word go, Brooklyn steers well clear of the downsides of many of its counterparts.Led by a stunningly mature performance from Saoirse Ronan, who from her first appearance in Joe Wrights classic Atonement has led a productive and interesting career in front of the camera that comes full circle with her turn as Eilis here, Brooklyn is a universally polished production.The character of Ronan's Eilis is a believable and thoughtful one, coming of age in a world where her allegiances remain torn between two powerful desires of family and love and although it seems likely that Room actress Brie Larson is a shoe in to take home the Best Actress Oscar this year, Ronan's work would be a worthy and deserved winner.Eilis's move from Ireland to the bustling streets of New York city brings about fantastic supporting characters like Julie Walters dryly comical land lady Mrs. Keogh, Jim Broadbent's kindly priest Father Flood and most impressively Eilis's love interest Tony, who from the word go is a baseball loving plumber we the audience side with thanks to Emory Cohen's impressive chemistry with Ronan. Eilis's interactions with all of these important figures give Brooklyn a real emotional heft and it's only in the films second half that the film somewhat loses momentum.Given the thankless task of winning us over after Cohen has come before him, Domhnall Gleeson's Irish local Jim Farrell never truly sparks with Eilis while Eilis's beloved mother as played by Jane Brennan isn't exactly someone we want to spend extra time with. In many ways the New York set pieces of Brooklyn are faultless and Eilis homecoming to the Guinness loving streets of Ireland feels like a lesser experience in the overall scheme of the movie.Beautifully acted and for a majority of its runtime perfectly executed in its goals, Brooklyn is a period romance of the highest order and a fantastic central showcase for the skills of Ronan as a performer.Crowley with his impressive array of behind the scenes and front of scene workers has therefore created the type of romantic tinged movie that Nicolas Sparks and the likes could only but dream of.4 ½ regretful meals out of 5"
BROOKLYN,11 December 2015,10/10,"Brooklyn (2015) was directed by John Crowley. It's based on a novel by Colm Tóibín.In this wonderful movie, Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis, a young woman from a small Irish town. Eilis is the key to everything (and everyone) else in the movie. Ronan is a superb actor, and the movie would have been very different--and might not have worked--without her as the star. Eilis is the sun in this movie, and all the other characters revolve around her. There are excellent actors who are excellent co-stars, but the story starts and begins with Eilis.Ronan is very beautiful, but that quality is played down in the film. In the film, she's intelligent, kind, hard-working, and attractive.In 1952, Eilis emigrates to the U.S., and finds a boarding house and a job in Brooklyn. I grew up in Brooklyn during that period, so I can attest to the accuracy of the movie's depiction of that time and place. Incidentally, the fanaticism with which the people Eilis meets worship the Brooklyn Dodgers isn't exaggerated. When I was a kid, we could sort of accept Yankee fans as friends, because their team played in a different league. But you really couldn't be friends with a Giants fan.This might have been a simple romantic movie about girl meets boy in Brooklyn. However, it's much more than that. Eilis travels back to Ireland, and now, as a sophisticated young woman, she's very much sought after.What happens next is the key to the movie. You'll have to watch Brooklyn to find out. Watching Brooklyn is actually a pleasure. The film is carrying a very high 8.1 rating on IMDb, and that's deserved.We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester NY. It will work on a small screen, but it's probably better to see it in a theater. It's a must-see movie. Just don't miss it.P.S. I hope everyone reading this review who lives in or near Rochester, NY, recognizes the quality of the films shown at The Little Theatre, on East Avenue. Right now The Little is screening Suffragette, Trumbo, Spotlight, and Brooklyn. (Also Macbeth, which we haven't yet seen.)If you love movies, and you're not a member of The Little, you should be!"
BROOKLYN,20 October 2016,10/10,"Brooklyn doesn't tell what the movie is about, especially when we don't see much of the borough and that the heart of the story deals also with Ireland ! In fact, this movie is about roots, hometown, the family we come from and the family we can build ! Like Saoirse, i made the choice to leave the place where i was born to get a job. Going that way, my heart is always hurt when i think to what i have left behind and for sure, there is always the imprecise future and the probability to come back to take care of family business ! Thus i find the movie to be totally fit to my feelings and it's maybe the first movie that comes so close ! In addition, the production is really neat (no awful blue / orange grading) and it was sweet to come back in a period with values and education ! Saoirse has now become a woman and she gains in seriousness. The movie has also parallels with another Irish destiny, Circle of friends and at the end, the scent of Ireland families, villages and nature were refreshing. At the end, it's a good movie, maybe too monotonous and quiet and for sure with too long credits (one long minute of boring logos before and more than 7 minutes at the end!)"
BROOKLYN,6 March 2016,3/10,"Review: Man, this film was boring! I've never been a big fan of Saoirse Ronan, because she seems a bit dead behind the eyes, so to watch her for 2 hours, travelling from Ireland to America to make a life for herself, wasn't very appealing. I did read some great reviews about the film so I was expecting a movie spectacular but as usual, I was totally let down. All of the scenes with Julie Walters (Mrs. Keogh) were great but apart from that, I didn't really like the film at all. I did feel for Ellis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), when she first landed in Brooklyn, with no friends and nothing in common with the American folk but once she settles down and meets her boyfriend, Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), the movie turns into a love story and becomes really slow and uninteresting. When she returns to Ireland for her sisters funeral, I was amazed how quickly she fell for Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), but that relationship was doomed from the start because of her marriage to Tony. Because of Ellis's squeaky clean morals, the ending wasn't surprising and I must admit, it felt like the movie was never going to end. The whole tone and music made the film drag, so I'm sorry to say that it gets the thumbs down from me. Disappointing! Round-Up: I'm most probably the only person that didn't enjoy this film, judging by the movies box office takings, and the fact that it was up for a best picture Oscar, along with Best Writing and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, proves that you shouldn't always believe the hype. I did like Jim Broadbent, who was very sweet to Ellis throughout the film but it was definitely Julie Walters who brought some comedy to this, somewhat glum movie. It was directed by John Crowley, who brought you Intermission, Boy A, Is Anybody There, with Michael Caine, Closed Circuit, with Eric Bana and a couple of episodes of True Detective (2014). He done well in terms of the cinematography and the various costumes but apart from that, I personally felt empty when the film had finished.Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $50millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/dramas starring Saoirse Ronan, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Hugh Gormley and Maeve McGrath. 3/10"
BROOKLYN,29 November 2015,10/10,"We know, in that achingly familiar phrase, that ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" but we sometimes forget that our memories will remain only in our experience and cannot be recreated in time. It is a hard lesson to be learned and one that Eilis Lacey (pronounced Ailish) (Saoirse Ronan, ""Atonement""), a young Irish Catholic girl who has left Ireland to seek a better life in America has to grapple with. Based on the novel by Colm Tóibín with a screenplay by Nick Hornby (""Wild"") and set in 1951, John Crowley's (""Boy A"") Brooklyn is an old-fashioned romantic film that tells a simple and authentic story that has a beginning, a middle and an end and makes us long for simpler times. Leaving her elderly mother (Jane Brennan) and adored sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) in the small Irish town of Enniscorthy in Ireland, Ellis arrives in New York bewildered but hopeful after a journey marred by seasickness. It is only after she begins a job as a salesperson in a ritzy department store in Brooklyn where her leering supervisor Miss Fortini (Jessica Paré) trains her to deal with their upscale customers that homesickness begins to set in and she longs for her mother and sister. The job, a room in a boarding house with other Irish immigrants, and night classes in accounting at Brooklyn College are all provided by Father Flood (Jim Broadbent, ""Paddington""), a reminder of the contribution that caring priests with integrity can provide, one that most immigrants do not have. Thomas Wolfe's in his novel ""You Can't Go Home Again"" described Brooklyn as being ""a completely triumphant Standard Concentrated Blot upon the Face of the Earth"" with ""no size, no shape, no heartand no anything."" The Brooklyn that Ellis finds is a welcoming place, however, far removed from the horror described by Wolfe. Because she is so eager to learn and adjust to her new life, she overcomes her feelings of being a stranger in a strange land and finds people who support her, especially the irrepressible Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters), the boarding house owner, who acts as a buffer between her and catty boarders Diana (Eve Macklin) and Patty (Emily Bett Rickards). No matter how hard she tries to forget, Ellis is reminded of home when she hears Irish singer Iarla Ó Lionáird singing the Irish ballad ""Casadh an Tsúgáin"" (Horses and Ploughs) at a Christmas charity dinner for the homeless where she volunteers. At an Irish dance, she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen (""The Place Beyond the Pines""), a young somewhat stereotypical Italian man who goes to these dances because he is attracted to Irish girls. Tony, an avid Dodger fan who works as a plumber, sounds like a cross between Vito Corleone and Rocky Balboa but is sweet and full of charm and, if nothing else, very persistent.Their relationship grows when Tony invites Ellis to his home to meet his family, a scene stolen by Tony's brash and funny eight-year-old brother Frankie (James DiGiacomo) who lets everyone know right away that ""the Italians hate the Irish."" Their relationship is put on temporary hold, however, when unforeseen circumstances force Ellis to return to Ireland. Happy to see her mother again and to be back in familiar surroundings, she is also reminded of the small-town mindset as personified by the gossipy mean-spirited Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan, ""Shadow Dancer""), Eilis's one-time employer. Her stay extended to attend a friend's wedding, Ellis is offered work at an accounting office and is courted by an old friend Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson, ""Ex Machina""), a circumstance that confronts her with choices that will affect the rest of her life. Featuring a remarkable breakout performance by Saoirse Ronan and strong support by Emory Cohen and Julie Walters, Brooklyn provides the setting for a young woman to grow in strength, not through trauma or crisis, but through the discovery of her own personal power, a rare experience in today's entertainment culture that panders to the lowest common denominator."
BROOKLYN,23 August 2020,9/10,"Guys, how beautiful and passionate this film is, so much delicacy, consumed me in love and longing ... And I cried your pains as if mine were, so simple, painful, beautiful and fun, a graceful and very well produced dramatic novel, photography , the costumes take us back to the 60s and recreates a beautiful, nostalgic and charming time ... Only the pain she inflicted on her mother was too unfair ..."
BROOKLYN,22 February 2016,9/10,"As much as ""Brooklyn"" is a vibrantly realized 1950s period piece, the story itself is a throwback too; it's a reminder of a classic storytelling technique seemingly uncommon at the movies today – draw in the audience in and charm its socks off. Saoirse Ronan, who at 21 years old comes off as a veteran of the screen, leads ""Brooklyn"" in every sense of the word as Eilis (""AY- lish""), a young Irish woman whose mother and sister send her off to New York for opportunities unavailable to her in Ireland. Her adjustment to America comes with a bout of fierce homesickness, but her spirits lift when she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), a young Italian man. If that doesn't sound like a plot with much conflict to you, you're right – ""Brooklyn"" isn't built around any kind of conceit or ""main predicament"" (at least not initially). Rather, it tells mostly linear story with different conflicts woven throughout. Tony, for example, doesn't arrive until the film's second act. So ""Brooklyn"" is foremost an immigrant story, and second a love story, even when Eilis' life becomes more complex upon returning home and connecting with Jim (Domhnall Gleeson).Writer Nick Hornby, whose books (""Fever Pitch,"" ""About A Boy"" and ""High Fidelity"") and screenplays (""An Education"" and 2014's ""Wild"") have always made for enjoyable if not terrific films, continues his success with this adaptation of Colm Toibin's novel. Although director John Crowley does a great job, there's no question that ""Brooklyn"" works because of the script and the performances. Hornby creates instant empathy for Eilis and does a masterful job with relationships/dynamics between characters, even with small supporting roles. Consequently, it's hard not to be instantly charmed by the film.Ronan and Cohen's chemistry is the prime example of what makes ""Brooklyn"" easy to love. There's such sweetness and naivety in their characters and performances, but also an impressive maturity. They are smitten with each other, and it's a pleasure to watch on screen bolstered by Hornby's script.The story contains a lot of the classic conventions of the immigrant story and the romance between two people from different worlds, but the drama doesn't take cliché turns. You might expect Eilis and Tony's cultures to collide at some point in a negative way, but ""Brooklyn"" isn't interested in visiting the obvious themes. The story belongs to Eilis and follows her journey as a young woman given the opportunity to make her own decisions. It depicts her hardships, but does not frame her as a victim of a cruel and abusive male-dominated world. In that sense, the film is refreshing and novel, which you wouldn't expect from such a simple premise.Finally, it's hard to imagine how great of an actress Ronan will become given how much she's grown already since bursting onto the scene as a young girl in 2007's ""Atonement."" ""Brooklyn"" is a big step for her that really showcases what she's capable of. This is Eilis' story and it follows her emotional journey as much as her physical one. In a more complex and big-billed film, she's sure to become the household name no one can pronounce. (For the record, it's SIR-shuh.)~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
BROOKLYN,9 March 2016,9/10,"Brooklyn is a 2015 Irish film that stars Saorise Ronan as a young Irish girl living in Ireland in Wexford who moves to the states to immigrant. While she is staying in the states with a woman(played by Julie Waters) and other lodgers she later meets a handsome Italian American named Tony at an Irish Dance and the two fall madly in love. Allis(Ronan)does get a job in a department store and goes to school to learn,and she at first is homesick but she gets used to the States. But when tragedy strikes back in Wexford will this mean that Allis will have to go back to Ireland again??Bottom line I really liked this film. The acting was top notch I liked Saorise Ronan as Allis and Jim Broadbent is in this flick too as a priest(in an Irish accent which was very good btw) and the rest were good too,the score was nice, and the story was very well executed. I liked how Ronan's charcther starts off homesick and in one point of the film she litreally gets sick on the ferry and meets a woman who tells her all the trades in America. The setting of 1950s America was very well done too I loved how they made NYC old school. Now I wasn't a fan of Irish film since I am an Irish girl myself but this one won me over.9/104.5/5See It"
BROOKLYN,1 December 2015,8/10,"""Brooklyn"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of a small town's young Irish woman Eilis Lacey (played by Saoirse Ronan). As the movie opens, we see Eilis get up early to go to church, after which it's just another day at work (in a grocery store), except that Eilis informs her employer that she's moving to New York, courtesy of a contact her sister Rose made in New York. Upon first arriving in New York (in the early 1950s), Eilis is overwhelmed by home sickness. Just as things seemingly can't get worse, Eilis meets Tony, a young Italian plumber who seeks to court Eilis. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Irish director John Crowley and, equally if not more importantly, written by Nick Hornby (based on Colm Tóibín's book of the same name). While the movie is of course plot-heavy (side comment: avoid the trailer at all cost, as it unnecessarily hints at a major plot twist, which turned out to be the case), the movie makers actually play up the emotional aspects to the hilt. Eilis' longing for home (i.e. Ireland) will tug at your heart, as do later scenes. In fact, let's just go ahead and say it outright: ""Brooklyn"" is an old fashioned romantic weepie, the likes of which I haven't seen too much (can't speak for all those Nicolas Sparks movie adaptations). It all falls on the shoulders of Saoirse Ronan, still only 21 yrs. old if you can believe it. She is the heart and soul of the movie, and captures the young women's aching perfectly. There is a great sentimental/romantic orchestral movie score, composed by Michael Brook, that is worth seeking out as well.The movie expanded nationally over the Thanksgiving weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I aw this at was attended nicely (heavy on the seniors, I might add). If you like a good ol' fashioned love story, with a nice immigrant angle to it (I myself am an immigrant to this country), you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, but don't forget to have the Kleenexes handy! ""Brooklyn"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
BROOKLYN,22 November 2015,4/10,"If many men are guilty of falling for mindless, hyper-violent ""guy films,"" then can't women also admit to crass self-indulgence when they patronize and approve of such films as ""Brooklyn,"" a veritable ""chick flick"" if there ever was one? Apparently the critics have also fallen for this empty vessel of a film masquerading as an art house triumph. Call me a curmudgeon but the best thing that can be said about Brooklyn is that it's a beautiful Hallmark Greeting card!Brooklyn begins in post-World War II Ireland and stars the very attractive Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey, a young woman who decides to make a new life for herself in the United States. Note that good melodramas have good villains but the best Brooklyn can muster is Miss Kelly, the vindictive shopkeeper who later proves to be a significant stumbling block in Eilis' herculean effort to resolve a tough refrain of ""torn between two lovers.""Aside from Miss Kelly (who has scant screen time for the main antagonist), most of the other characters Eilis encounters on her journey from Ireland to New York and back, are of the goody two- shoes variety. There is of course her long-suffering mother and sister, a kindly priest who arranges for her passage to New York, a sympathetic fellow female traveler who's already been to the US who helps Eilis with an embarrassing bout of seasickness on the passage over, not to mention the sage advice she imparts on how to ""act like an American"" upon arrival.Once Eilis is firmly ensconced at the Irish Boarding house in Brooklyn, she's taken under her wing by the an overbearing landlady, Madge Kehoe, who implies that the other young women staying there are guilty of shameless moral turpitude. We don't learn that much about Eilis' fellow boarders but her boss at her new job initially appears to have some potential as a bitchy martinet—only to morph into a bland do-gooder just as soon as Eilis is called back to Ireland following a family tragedy.After about a good half hour, when you've already expected the proceedings to have broken into Act II, Eilis finally takes a substantial step into her new world by meeting Beau #1, the ever so perfect ""Tony,"" who is confident that Irish lass Eilis will fit in quite nicely with his cute and perfect Italian family. It soon becomes quite apparent that screenwriter Nick Hornby knows little about Italian-Americans in general so all we learn about Tony is that he loves the Brooklyn Dodgers and works as a plumber (oh yes, he's a wonderful guy to boot!). Meanwhile Eilis's chums back at the boarding house are determined to show Eilis how to fit in with her potential in-laws by teaching her how to twirl spaghetti at the dinner table! There's also Tony's precocious little brother who manages to talk like an adult and hardly like a kid growing up in the early 50s.Brooklyn is designed to manipulate your emotions at every turn so just imagine if director John Crowley didn't have a maudlin string section to intrude whenever significant plot points reach their fever pitch. The strings are particularly ubiquitous when Eilis returns to Ireland following the death of her sister. The lack of character development is also heavily apparent when it comes to Beau #2, Jim Farrell. He's basically the Irish version of Tony, another wonderful ""nice guy"" who eventually learns that slicked back hair is not the way to ""get the girl."" Oh yes, he also will be inheriting his parents' house when they move to the country (proving that he's obvious good ""marriage material"").Finally we arrive at the moment which explains why Brooklyn's antagonist, the meddling Miss Kelly, is only a minor presence in the narrative. The primary antagonist is part of Eilis's internal arc, not external. Poor Eilis cannot choose between Tony and the new world and her homesickness, which also means a new bookkeeping job in Ireland as well as potential nuptials with Jim. The previously alluded to ""torn between two lovers"" refrain is precisely what fires the passions of all those women (and their male enablers) who fall for such rampant sentiment. For them, Eilis' internal conflict is understandable—even natural, and is proof of her nobility. For me it only underscores Eilis' fickleness and lack of strength of character (and this is perhaps where men and women differ: women see the influence of Eilis' homesickness and attraction for home-bred Jim as emotionally understandable and excusable; men see the broken vow to Tony (after she marries him back in New York), as irrational!If Brooklyn gets anything right, it's in the excellent production design, which undoubtedly awakens nostalgia for the good old days of the late 40s and early 50s. I like how Brooklyn Heights has been transformed into ""halcyon days"" replete with those long forgotten street signs and various vehicles of that era, not to mention the fabulous women's dresses and bathing suits (most honorable mention goes to Ms. Ronan's fabulous yellow dress). Brooklyn's acting ensemble (and notably Ms. Ronan in the lead role) perform well despite the simplistic script. Mr. Hornby can do little in fleshing out his characters but occasionally provides a few twists and turns in the plot (the foreshadowing where Eilis runs into a fellow Irish denizen at the municipal court before she gets married, nicely sets up Miss Kelly's extortion plot, forcing Eilis to admit she was already married in America and subsequently is forced to return!).As a self-confessed, semi-curmudgeon, Brooklyn is precisely the type of film that immediately gets up my (critical) gander. Let me be clear that I don't dislike every chick flick that's out there—certainly there are certain romantic comedies that have no trouble passing muster. But when a chick flick such as this dips into the realm of the bathetic, all bets are off."
BROOKLYN,15 February 2016,5/10,"""Brooklyn' is a strange film. At the heart of it all it's a love story, entirely from the female's point of view. There are other things going on but this is the centre point around which the story is based. Yet the love story is so uninteresting and unoriginal that it's incredibly hard to enjoy. There's very little in the way of conflict and the only interesting thing that actually happens regarding it is based on a very strange and seemingly out of character decision. I can imagine this working a lot better as a book, or possibly with the lead character narrating things because as it stands, it's very hard to get into the head of character and understand her motives.Saoirse Ronan has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. She's good, but never blew me away in any sense. She hit the emotional notes when needed and shed a few tears here and there, but there's no comparison between her and guaranteed winner Brie Larson. The fact that she's the best chance of causing an upset out of all the nominees will be of great comfort to Larson. That's not to be mean or say she was poor, she simply didn't do enough to warrant winning an Oscar and Larson did. It's that simple.The film has also been nominated for Best Picture also. I can't help but think there were better films than this in 2015 that didn't get a nod. It sounds like it was quite a hit at Sundance and this went a long way to ensuring its nomination, but I'm not buying into it. The love story is rushed and has no conflict, the story of her having a hard time leaving Ireland and dealing with a new country is hardly enough to carry a movie and her decision when she returns just makes me lose any sympathy or caring for the character whatsoever. We are meant to root for her, but why should we? Some fine acting and occasionally well written dialogue cover up a lot of the gaping flaws and if you don't over think it you might even really enjoy it. Not for me though."
BROOKLYN,5 November 2015,8/10,"I really like Brooklyn, although there is not much to it. It's your basic story about an immigrant who comes to America for a better life and finds it, until a tragedy in the family feeds her home sickness and causes a dilemma, between staying home and going back.There was nothing spectacular about this movie at all. The story was OK, the actors were charming but not amazing and the scenery was so- so. Yet all together, these elements made for a movie that was good to sit though. It does touch you watching the main character Eilis' adventure to America and the love story attached to the film was nicely done. It's was very humorous as well. I'm also becoming a fan of Domhnall Gleeson and it was fun to see him do something a little different (or sport a different look) than the parts I know him from, like About Time and Ex-Machina.Does not feel like the type of movie that will win any awards or stand out from the crowd, but it will make you smile when you watch it."
BROOKLYN,24 January 2016,9/10,"Saorise Ronan gives the performance of the year in Brooklyn, playing a young Irish immigrant seeking a better life in 1950s New York. Ellis Lacey arrives in Brooklyn and is immediately struck with both culture shock and home sickness. She lives with other Irish girls in a rooming house and works as a cashier at an exclusive store. At night, she attends school to eventually become a bookkeeper and accountant. At a dance with fellow Irish men and women she meets Tony, An Italian boy from the city. They follow the typical story line and fall in love. Heartbreak ensues and we get beautiful scenery from County Wexford and an excellent soundtrack to make Brooklyn one of the ten best movies of 2015."
BROOKLYN,24 February 2019,,"Irish young woman travels from her small, chatty hometown (leaving behind her mother, older sister, and unhappy employment) to New York City to start anew in the early 1950s. She's intelligent and ambitious, but her lack of worldly experience makes the transition difficult, not to mention that much more emotionally draining. Thoughtful, heartfelt drama effectively captures the mood and essence of the specific time period, but more importantly spotlights a broad range of tangible feelings like loneliness, isolation, love, and the loss of innocence. It doesn't hurt that the acting is first-rate, led by a beautifully earnest, wide-eyed Ronan who perfectly embodies her character's growth and conflicting wave of emotions. ***"
BROOKLYN,25 May 2016,8/10,"This beautiful, sprawling drama is as full of hope and love as its protagonist, Eilis (Saoirse Ronan). Truly well directed, shot, and acted.Eilis is a young woman for whom her sister Rose scrimps and saves so that she (Eilis) can travel to America, in 1952, to start a better life. Life in her small Irish town is good, but there's little future in it. Her mean-spirited employer gives her a hard time over Eilis' leaving, but that won't stop our plucky heroine! Off to America! Good thing her local priest already has a job lined up for her, and a place to stay to boot.Eilis finds it difficult to adjust to life in New York City, where she works in a department store. Lots of hustle and bustle there, a far cry from her small hamlet! She's suspicious of anyone not in her own situation, which makes her a little antisocial for a time, but soon she opens up to her fellow boarders (all young Irish lasses themselves) and finds love, true love, in the person of a personal Italian named Tony, a guy who has a thing for Irish girls.Then, tragic news from back home, and Eilis must return to Ireland. But for how long? Will she come back to Tony? Will she find someone else with red hair and fair complexion instead? Tune in to find out! It's a terrific movie, not the least because of Ronan's great, heartfelt performance. Also, check out Julie Walters as the landlord at Eilis' boarding home - she steals the movie, practically. And the movie's so well done that you can forgive a lapse into sitcom-level misunderstandings that occurs in the final third or so of the film. Go with it, and it's a journey well taken."
BROOKLYN,19 March 2018,6/10,"Part of the post- war Irish Diaspora were large numbers of young women many of whom headed for New York where,as the contemporary song has it ""Every street's a boulevard"".
Mrs Keogh's brownstone was home for half a dozen such girls who seem to spend most of their time bitching at one another.
Ellis is one such tenant.
She is played by Miss S.Ronan as bright but naïve.
She meets and,in secret,marries a young Italian plumber before returning to Ireland in response to a family crisis.
Subsequently she finds herself on the horns of a dilemma.
How she resolves it is the real let - down of this slight film.
In fact she seems paralysed by her situation and merely marking time when a solution is thrust upon her.
Miss Ronan is fine as Ellis within the limits set by the writer.
She is a bit detached and a trifle smug,neither particularly likeable attributes.
Mr Broadbent is lovely as Father Flood - everybody's dream priest and fellow Brit Miss Walters sometimes staggers on the brink of Stage Oirishness but always manages to right herself at the last moment.
Opinions on ""Brooklyn"" vary widely,but I believe it's not as good as it's proponents say,nor as bad as it's detractors.
The highpoint for me was the down and outs' Christmas dinner.
""These are the men that dug the tunnels and built the bridges"" says Jim Broadbent - the most memorable line in the film."
BROOKLYN,15 February 2016,8/10,"In the immortal words of the Beastie Boys, I got no sleep til ""Brooklyn"" was the last film I watched of the eight movies nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. So maybe I'm exaggerating, I did get some sleep, but nevertheless I think you should awaken yourself to the little tender movie that is ""Brooklyn"". The film stars a splendid Saoirse Ronan as young Irish Eilis, who flees from her Ireland home to Eilis Island, I mean Ellis Island (or close enough) to Brooklyn to start a new life. She gets homesick at first but then meets a young Italian named Tony who is struck by Eilis from the onset. But then tragedy occurs back in Ireland and Eilis must return home and stray from Tony. There she meets Irish Jim Farrrell (whose brother Colin has been in lots of movies). OK, I am kidding! Colin is not your Farrelll, Jim!. Anyways, Eilis takes a mini liking to Jim, but has not forgotten her Tony. So to put it in a new order, this becomes some sort of non-bizarre Irish-Italian love triangle. Director John Crowley did a fine job in developing ""Brooklyn"" without inserting any extravagant shenanigans; he kept it simple but not-stupid. Nick Hornby's Oscar-nominated screenplay was sweet but not resounding enough for it to warrant Oscar gold. Ronan atoned herself with a great performance in ""Brooklyn"" after some mediocre work after her Oscar-nominated work as a tween in ""Atonement"". As for the rest of the cast, the only one that stood out in the ""Brooklyn"" thespian crowd was that of Julie Walters as Mrs. Keogh, the matriarch of the boarding house Eilis stayed in Brooklyn. OK, my pun ferry ride to ""Brooklyn"" is over. Now it's your turn to go Eilis and watch this flick. **** Good"
BROOKLYN,1 November 2017,5/10,"(Flash Review)While the acting, costumes and production quality are all solid, the screenplay lacked intrigue. At its core this is a love story. A love story almost more between home than men. An Irish woman immigrates to Brooklyn, NY in the 1950's for a chance to get more out of life. While there, she falls in love with a down to Earth, normal, Italian guy. Upon a visit back to Ireland and with more life experience under her belt, she meets an upper class chap and another romance beginseven though she has a love back in Brooklyn. During the story many subtle events occur, which is fine, but none draw the viewer in and elicit much emotion. Perhaps, you can see the story arcs coming. What is less obvious, is that she is also wrestling with staying in her motherland vs going back to America. What will she decide? What events will influence her decision? The fact this nominated for three Oscars, which is coolthe one that scares me was one was for best adapted screenplay. For me, that was its weakness."
BROOKLYN,29 April 2016,8/10,"Lately it seems that the word immigrant has taken on a whole new meaning. Politicians from both sides of the aisle seem determined to either demonize immigrants or cast them into sainthood. The reality is that immigrants made this country what it is today. And for those politicians perhaps they should consider that it wasn't all immigrants but legal immigrants that helped form this melting pot. So what better time to release a film about an Irish immigrant who comes to America and finds love? BROOKLYN is just that, a sort of throwback to those romantic films of the past fueled by romance, love and affection rather than simple lusts and hookups. Saoirse Ronan stars as Eilis Lacey, a young woman who leaves behind her mother and sister in Ireland with the hope of creating a better life for herself in the United States. Sponsored by a local priest Eilis sets sail for America with no idea of what to expect. Fortunately she ends up bunking with a young woman who has been through the ropes already.Upon arrival Eilis takes up residence at a boarding house the priest set her up in Brooklyn, watched over by matriarchal Mrs. Keogh (Julie Walters). She and withdrawn, Eilis gets to know the other girls living there as well as the rules Mrs. Keogh establishes. In order to take care of herself the priest has also arranged a job for Eilis in a big department store. At first she finds this job difficult because of her shyness as well as a serious bout of homesickness. All of that changes when she meets Tony (Emory Cohen).Tony is a plumber who comes from a large Italian family. Although both come from different backgrounds the attraction is mutual and soon they are as serious a couple as can be found. Eilis meets Tony's family and they are taken with her. The movie does a great job of showing their love developing rather than have things move at light speed. You believe in the affection that bonds the two of them together.But thing change suddenly and Eilis is called back to Ireland. With plans of this being a short visit things alter those plans along with more than a few nudges from her mother. As the visit lengthen Eilis finds herself attracted to a young man in her home town named Jim (Domhnall Gleason). Eilis carries secrets with her tear at her, as she must come to terms with decisions made in the past and to be made. Just what decision she will make will affect not just her life but the lives of those around her.The movie is entertaining from start to finish. Not once does this movie become one where you find yourself staring at the clock, checking to see how much longer the movie is or grabbing the remote to fast forward. It engages you as a viewer and holds you captivated by the story of a young woman who not only discovers love but does so with two different men. How she comes to the decision she does by the end of the film is a satisfying conclusion to a movie that not only keeps you watching but makes you consider the lives of so many who came to this country all those years ago.While every performance involved in this film is superb it is that lead role of Eilis as performed by Saoirse Ronan that holds the movie together. Not once do you think this is an actress in a role. She captures the very essence of Eilis from early on in the film until its end. At only 21 years of age she has already rung up a number of outstanding performances in several films. She may have lost the Oscar this past year for this performance but I would be willing to bet the elusive award will find its way into her hands eventually.The movie is one of the best nights I've had in some time watching films to write about. As I said earlier I never once found myself looking for something else to do or somewhere else to be. I was too caught up in the story of this young woman in search of something better. My guess is that you will be as well. This one is not just a movie that you'll watch and forget, but one that you might want to add to your shelf."
BROOKLYN,15 February 2016,8/10,"Brooklyn is gorgeous old world esque Hollywood romance, cut from the same cloth as the tearful charmers of the 40's and 50's. It's also got some of the most lived in, authentic looking production design I've ever seen, efforts that it the filmmakers should be very proud of. Saoirse Ronan's intuitive, doe eyed acting style meshes perfectly with the material here, in the role of Eilis, a young Irish immigrant girl in the bustling spectacle of New York City for the first time. To go from a quaint, removed town in tiny Ireland to such a gigantic, populated environment is quite the culture shock indeed, and Ronan infuses this into her work nicely. She arrives with no friends, no family, under the sponsorship of a kindly priest (A relaxed Jim Broadbent, always welcome), boarding with a mother hen of a woman (Mrs. Weasle- I mean Julie Walters) and the other mischievous girls under her care. The scenes of them at the dinner table are packed with dry, well written girly banter and are a joy to watch. One day, as she must, she meets a boy in the form of blue collar Italian American Tony (Emory Cohen), and the two immediately have attraction that the film carefully, sparingly kindles with humble character development and realistic interaction. When tragedy calls her back to Ireland, their relationship is put to the test, and she beautifully comes to terms with lessons and trials which befall all girls and boys at such an age. The title of the movie is very fitting; the amount of painstaking care that has gone into bringing the setting and time period to life is staggering, from cars, costumes and architecture to the linguistic cadence that people used back then. Truly an immersive technical achievement, which when combined with the stellar performances and direction make a well rounded film in all areas."
BROOKLYN,19 November 2015,,"Sweet little love story of an Irish lass who comes to America circa 1950. She leaves her home in Enniscorthy (Co. Wexford) and comes to seek fame and fortune - and maybe a 'fella' - in Brooklyn. Subsequent events draw her back to Enniscorthy, and then back to Brooklyn. In between we come to know Eilis (pronounced Ailish) Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) quite well because it is her picture, and she is in nearly every scene. She changes from a homesick immigrant to a self-assured woman in the course of the picture, and Ronan's characterization is terrific.Along the way she meets Tony Fiorello, played by Emory Cohen in a role apparently underplayed so as not to upstage the main character. He comes from a big Italian family but is not a stereotypical Italian; he is barely audible and very subdued. Perhaps the best and most humorous scenes take place at dinnertime in Mrs. Kehoe's boarding house for Irish immigrant girls. Played by Julie Walters, she rides herd on her catty boarders and uses religious metaphors to put them in their place.""Brooklyn"" is a movie for grown-ups, an independent film in a sea of Hollywood schlock. It is a likable movie with a lot of heart and solid acting down to the smallest role. It is not a sprawling saga but a nice little movie, and I have only sketched a few instances. Many reviewers summarize the whole picture, but the overall tenor of the picture gives the moviegoer a rooting interest and a sense of the resiliency of the human spirit, as well as an illustration of the innate decency and goodness of Eilis Lacey.P.S. Those hoping to see scenes of Brooklyn neighborhoods will be disappointed; the picture was filmed in Canada and Ireland."
BROOKLYN,12 December 2015,10/10,"I can honestly say that I haven't seen a more satisfying film this year. It reminds me of the power of movie making. It has strong characters, a simple but well developed story, and produced in such a way that we are left gasping because it has been a while since we take a look at an era, without much of the gloss and ""artistry"" that is supposed to enhance but ends up cutting much of the power. This film reminds me of the romantic epics of the 50's, when the actors showed their power on the screen, and in the hands of a great director, the results were unforgettable.""Brooklyn"" is a very romantic film. It has a great love triangle, the type where there is no villain, but there are hard choices to make, where everything hinges on the decision of one of the characters because there is a need to grow as an individual, not leaving responsibilities behind, nor killing their own spirits. Oh, hearts will be broken, but spirits will soar by the end of the film.At the center is Ellis (Ronan), a young Irish woman, still innocent, looking forward to a new life. As the story develops, she learns a new trade, discovering her life is inextricably connected to both the past and the future. She can see the realization of future dreams.She finds a man who can fulfill most of her expectations, and it is at this moment that the film appears to reach its peak. Then, a turn of events has her back at home, and her choices become more and more difficult. It is at this moment that we don't know how things will turn out. We have hopes for our heroine, and this is when the movie becomes a delight. It is as traditional as we have ever seen, but it is so refreshing because we have been given too much originality recently. Love doesn't have the powerful it used to have. We have become jaded and disappointed by what Hollywood offers for this type of entertainment. ""Brooklyn"" has a young trio of people. Two men who love the same woman but never see each other. One fears losing her when she returns to her homeland. The other one desperately learns he might have a difficult time winning her heart. Then there is her own set of complex emotions, as she becomes aware of her changes and the pressure society imposes on women like her.Throughout the entire film, Ronan glows from the moment we see her working in the shop, exchanging intimate moments with her family, learning to adapt in a new society, trusting others, learning about love, life, loss. ""Brooklyn"" succeeds because all of the elements of this type of movie are there, and each one is perfectly executed. The audience can't hope for more. This is a complete production, with a simple concept, perfectly executed, giving us both respect for its theme, and most importantly, the feelings of both the characters and its connection to the audience. It's not clinical, aiming to be a cold and perfect production, but a film that matters because it is real, and that shows what movies are meant to be. Think about it, what could be more important than love? Its completion? its loss? its realization?"
BROOKLYN,30 October 2019,7/10,"Nostalgia is a feeling most immigrants must have experienced sooner or later. In this tale, Irish girl Eilis moves to Brooklyn hoping for a better life. She has left her beloved sister Rose at home. Also her mum, but there's not much space for filial love in this plot.After an indefinite time of loneliness and nostalgia, quiet girl Eilis starts to get involved with the Irish expats community and during a dance meets Italian boy Tony.Turns out, the solution to nostalgia is nothing more complicated than a love story. However, back home tragedy strikes and Eilis must go back to support her mum, after the unexpected death of Rose.This part of the plot is a bit thin, as Eilis does not seem to care much for her mum. She is out an about in no time, with nice guy Jim, double dating with her best friend and her fiancé.At this stage, Eilis must decide between the old (and reassuring) and the new (and exciting). Will the power of her roots and nostalgia win the game? Her future will be very different, according to her choice.Ronan is a great interpreter and the movie is carried by her performance. Also nice to see for once a female main character who is not bubbly, aggressive of slutty, like in most contemporary movies."
BROOKLYN,5 February 2016,8/10,"""Would you like to dance? Are you here with that guy? The one who was teaching you to dance? No. So would you dance with me? I'm not sure he taught me anything. Doesn't matter. The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing. Ah. I wish someone had told me that years ago.""No, I'm not really a big fan of romantic movies. Such movies that'll make the female audience melt and whimper in a handkerchief out of sympathy with the main character. And no, I'm not an insensitive lump of testosterone who only likes to watch action packed, macho movies. But yeah, I usually eschew this type of movies. And yet I wanted to see this movie. Not because I made a mistake while buying paper tissues and now I'm buried under it. And not because I'm in an emotional slump and felt the urge to watch a sad movie with a trembling lower lip and moist eyes. The only reason I really wanted to see this movie is because of Saoirse Ronan. In my eyes she's a revelation in Hollywood. A young, fresh and certainly not unattractive appearance. She breaths new life into Hollywood-land. And in addition to these physical characteristics I also have a deep admiration for her quirky choices she makes among the film roles offered to her. Ronan is the pulsating heart of this film. She requires our undivided attention during the whole film as the young Irish girl Eilis Lacey, who gets a chance to start a new life in the US. All by herself she travels to this far country, ignorant what awaits her. She's leaving her mother and sister behind and before she knows it she's torn by homesickness. Even her job as a saleswoman at Bartocci and accounting courses can't help. This emotion keeps her in a grip. Until she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), a shy young Italian, at a dance and she slowly transforms from an introverted, simple Irish countryside girl into a typical American city girl who wears colorful dresses and discovers makeup. Her attitude and confidence change drastically. Compare that shy, lost girl at Customs with the resolute young woman watching at a valley along with Tony who reveals his future plans. An independent, decisive woman with a strict, determined look and her hands in her side, gazing at the horizon.But it's not only Saoirse Ronan who shines in this film. Also the supporting cast is masterfully chosen and fits perfectly into the overall concept. Jane Brennan as Ellis's mother, a taciturn woman who accepts her fate and acts as if she has no emotions. Fiona Glascott as the sister Rose. Brid Brennan who plays the role of the haughty nosy Miss Kelly and surprisingly she plays an important role in the final decision of Eilis. Julie Walters as the owner of the guest house who needs to keep two light-headed boarders in line all the time. Domhnall ""About time"" Gleeson is an Irish village boy who makes an attempt to convince Eilis to stay in Ireland. And of course Emory Cohen and his Italian family. A confident young man who slowly tries to win the young Irish girl's heart.It's not the obvious part that moved me. Probably the female audience will shed a tear during the final scene. But I myself was especially touched when a homeless person at a dinner, organized by the priest (Jim Broadbent) who helped Eilis around in Brooklyn, sang a Gaelic song. So pure, so sincere and so imbued with nostalgia. Catchy and intense at the same time. But especially the acting of Ronan is wonderful. She's so explicitly present in this film. Her big steel-blue eyes, her modesty and her fragile personality. She shows what deep emotions she's going through, just by using a serene expression. A performance that stands out from any of her previous performances. The heartbreaking choice she has to make between dull, drizzly Ireland and exciting, vibrant America is perfectly portrayed by her. For me, the Oscar for ""Best Actress"" is already reserved.

BROOKLYN,31 December 2015,6/10,"This is the story of a young Irish woman who leaves rural Ireland to live in Brooklyn , New York. Despite her home sickness , she meets a man and falls in love but the lure of going back home threatens to scupper the relationship. Brooklyn is real old fashioned love story that could quite easily have been made in the 40's or 50's. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant and is turning into a very accomplished actress . There is also a very good cameo from Julie Walters who plays the very funny Mrs. Kehoe . Some critics have gushed over this film , I don't quite see that myself but none the less it was quite enjoyable. Having said that I doubt I am the target audience."
BROOKLYN,17 December 2015,,"This gem of a movie is very quiet yet powerfully emotional with a fine central performance and a convincing sense of period. Adapted from Colm Tóibin's novel by fellow writer Nick Hornby, this is the early 1950s experience of small town Irish girl Eilis (Saoirse Ronan who coincidentally was born in New York) who leaves the island and sails to a new life in New York, subsequently to find herself sought by two young men, Italian-American Tony (Emory Cohen) and Irishman Jim (Domhnall Gleeson).All the performances are perfectly pitched with delightful cameos from Jim Broadbent and Juli Walters, but this is the movie that makes a star of Ronan. In ""Atonement"", she was convincing but slightly odd-looking in a small but pivotal role; in Hanna"", she was accomplished as the eponymous robotic assassin who had more action than words; but here she is simply sublime, conveying beautifully the transition from mousy and introvert immigrant to sweet and confident lover.If there is a weakness in the film, it is the rather sudden and simple resolution of the central conflict but, that apart, this is an essentially flawless and immensely satisfying work."
BROOKLYN,29 November 2015,6/10,"(Rating: ☆☆½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended. In brief: Saoirse Ronan brings forth a delicate performance in a standard romantic yarn (or yawn).GRADE: B-Ellis is an Irish lassie who is torn between two lands and two lovers in John Crowley's romantic drama, Brooklyn. Acted to perfection by Saoirse Ronan in the central role, the film follows the travels of a young immigrant in 1952. With the financial help of a doting priest, she leaves her Irish countryside behind and arrives in America, homesick but ready to start a new life. Away from her loving sister and mother, she lives at a boarding house for single women and lands not only a job but a cute boyfriend as well. Of course, complications must arrive too, sending her back to Ireland and forcing her to make life-changing decisions in the process. ￼The film chugs along at a leisurely pace as it fleshes out its interesting characters, even if their actions don't always match their words. The film is bathed in a warm nostalgic glow and the director provides some fine touches. There is an authentic period style throughout the film, which is especially impressive with his small budget.￼The film's biggest strength lies in its acting, which is consistently strong and makes one overlook its thin story which is weighed down with too many plot contrivances. The aforementioned Ms. Ronan creates a vivid heroine and the two men in her life, Tony (Emory Cohen) and Jim (Domhnall Gleason), are charming objects of affection. Both actors play their roles nicely. A stellar supporting cast is led by Fiona Glascott and Jane Brennan as her family members, Brid Brennan, Jim Broadbent, and Julie Walters, giving the film added sparks and showing off her comic timing very well.￼Yet all the actors' hard work is undermined by Nick Hornby's romanticized and heavy-handed script. It develops its characters well enough, but his plot becomes far too transparent and never builds any real tension or passion. It puts Ellis and her friends in early 1950's backdrops acting more vintage and nothing takes place in a convincingly real world. Ethnic stereotypes (the fun loving Italian family, the proud Irish clan) and standard conventional types abound (the mean boss, the loving boyfriend, the outspoken landlady, the doting priest, etc.). Everyone seems like piled-on plot devices rather than real people.￼Still, Brooklyn is enjoyable in its sentimental look at more innocent times and its lead performance by Ms Ronan is well worth seeing. But like some foreign visitors, the film overstays its welcome and never acclimates to its new surroundings as well as it could. The film certainly doesn't earn a Bronx cheer, but there's no big hurrah for it in any of the other four boroughs, or here either.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
BROOKLYN,22 December 2015,8/10,"The romance is nice in this movie. It doesn't overwhelm the movie as in many other romance movies. I like what the movie did with the setting and mood, even though the movie lacks in long and panoramic shots. The costume, the location choices and the set built were great in depicting the authenticity of the era. The focus on the main character nicely sets the movie aside from the common mediocrities of other romance movies. There are some nice call-backs at the end of the movie. The movie is dominant on the indoor setting than the outdoor, yet it nicely managed to stay away quite a bit from heavy use of close-up shots. The acting overall feels nice, mostly of Saoirse Ronan's performance. Emory Cohen and Domnhall Gleeson did well enough to provide balance as the men in Ellis' life."
BROOKLYN,29 April 2017,7/10,"Brooklyn for the most part was a well directed film that showcased excellent acting and a great story. We see an Irish girl travel to America and then build a lifestyle that is hard to leave behind such as her marriage, job and new friends. In Ireland she has her mother, a job she can easily jump into and a well to do suitor. The film takes a unique look at the tug of war one can face with two lifestyles in different countries. It was a great story that looked at a certain period in history that involved large scale immigration. However the story's end was a let down. We see the main character almost going back to Ireland when an incident of potential blackmail makes her now want to go back home. The logic and emotion behind this was unexplained and could leave viewers scratching their heads. Why did she decide to return to America? What was the audience supposed to see and understand here? The story felt built up with her dilemma only to be offered a weird explanation in the end, its like the director didn't know how to end the film."
BROOKLYN,24 April 2016,4/10,"This movie is the weakest of the Oscar nominated movies. Very slow moving, not much action, and some dry humor. Sarise Ronan has become different from when she starred in Hanna back in 2011. The setting in which the movie takes place is very accurate. The cinematography is very dark and the sound mix doesn't sound as good as The Revanant. I suggest watching this movie with a friend who loves drama and teen angst. The music is well done, and fits in the movie. There were scenes where i had to go to my smartphone and play some games since the movie slogs at a slow pace. How the academy nominated this piece of junk is far beyond comprehension. This movie is worth a rental if you care about the movie. It would've been more interesting if there were more violence and sex to have an R Rating."
BROOKLYN,5 February 2018,9/10,"Brooklyn is one of those movies you think might possibly be passed over in this era of CGI action fodder. Only to find it has become a record breaker of its genre. Perhaps screenplay writer, Nick Hornby and director, John Crowley may never top the level of perfection they have achieved with this mature production. Neither of these men lived through the 50's - yet have avoided falling into the trap of adding too many 'modern' touches - creating a near perfect representation of the life and times of that era. Art direction and cinematography add further important creative technical touches. Young Saoirse Ronan does wonders with her important role as Eilis, an Irish girl facing the challenging step of leaving home and country - to start a new life in a strange land. With a flawless cast this often sad tale is brought to the screen with all the nuances of real-life sparklingly intact. Good to see the always reliable Jim Broadbent being used to good advantage. Congratulations are certainly due to all involved with transferring Colm Toibin's descriptive novel to the cinema (and maybe even adding helpful touches along the way). A rich addition to the overall impact comes from Canadian composer Michael Brook's truly beautiful score.Strong recommendation for lovers of quality motion pictures examining the morals, difficulties, and times, of those who went before us."
BROOKLYN,28 April 2019,7/10,"""Brooklyn"" tells the story of a young Irish girl who moves to the United States in order to build a new life. She is able to make a living and meets a man she wants to marry when the sudden death of her sister forces her to return to her lonely mother in Ireland. Once there, she is introduced to a charming Irish man, who soon falls in love with her and forces her to take a tough decision.In some elements, this movie is great. The intensity with which it describes this young woman being torn apart over two men is amazing and deeply touching. A beautiful acting does the rest to draw you into the story. Unfortunately a lot of the other elements of the movie are very much Hollywood and all in all look a bit too clean for my taste. It's maybe the will to tell a great cineastic tale that prevents a sense of nasty and brutal realism that could have added additional depth.All in all this still is one of the better Blockbuster movies. It has a story to tell, convinces with good casting choices and a touching dilemma. A bit less clean and this could have been even more than that."
BROOKLYN,18 August 2016,6/10,"Brooklyn is a film that I had up interest in attending, more in no time I created a hype in this film , and he was What do I expected, even though a movie with good marks from critics , the cast is good, we have a promising Saoirse Ronan , Domhnall Gleeson are you doing enough movies, Emory Cohen , Jim Broadbent , Julie Walters , Jessica Paré , etc., the direction is John Crowley (Closed Circuit) , and he is well , even knowing that it is very inexperienced , the script has some missteps , most not commits both , the acting is good , and the scene on the ship were in my the most interesting opinion , has until moments that humor works , Brooklyn is a reasonable film to weak , it has a good cast and a good direction , more sins in the rhythm and how the story is told , even with a competent script. Note 6.1"
BROOKLYN,21 April 2016,7/10,"BROOKLYN is rather innocuous as period dramas go, but also suffers a little bit for its dogged adherence to convention. The story is about Ellis (pronounced 'Ay-lish,' and played with aplomb by Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish woman who travels to America for better job opportunities. While there she meets a handsome Italian man. However, trouble back in the home country prompts her to go back, and she finds herself torn between two homes (and two men). While I didn't find myself completely engaged on a story level, BROOKLYN has much to offer in terms of acting talent and production values. This was Saoirse Ronan's movie through and through, and she carried it with a calculated assuredness beyond her years. She's also not terrible to look at either, and her eyes do a lot to keep you on her side, even while making some (retrospectively) poor decisions. The other elements I thought worked rather well were some excellent soundtrack choices and economical camera-work which lent the film the intimacy required for a small-scale drama. Perhaps those choices made it less cinematic than it could have been, but I'll take unpretentious over its opposite any day. There was also a warmth and vibrancy to the overall visual style which contributed to a nostalgic feel that I enjoyed, at least on that level. What isn't as forgivable is how straight the narrative and themes are developed in terms of the time period it depicted. I don't think that everything has to be approached in a ""wink, wink"" post-modern fashion, but it is possible to create characters and situations that fit a certain historical period while also acknowledging modern social ideas. But in BROOKLYN's world, the pinnacle of a woman's life is finding that right man to settle down with, and part of the plot hinges on this very outdated notion. Some concessions are made in terms of Ellis' career goals, but she sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the other female characters around her. I won't give away any spoilers, but I can say that convention is the name of the game here. The filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is easy to watch, enjoyable even, but ultimately a hollow, unchallenging experience. It's ""feel-good"" entertainment in a lot of ways, but little of the emotion that came through felt earned. I liked the film overall, and there are many other people who probably will as well, but it could have been more than what was presented."
BROOKLYN,24 July 2018,7/10,"In 1952, Eilis Lacey (played by Saoirse Ronan) is a young woman who immigrates from a small Irish town to Brooklyn where she is to start a new life. During a visit back home, she feels conflicted about whether she should stay there or return to her new life in the U.S.""Brooklyn"" is a sweet film that succeeds at being sentimental without being cloying. It has an old-fashioned warmth particularly when it is being romantic.There are other aspects to admire especially a scene when homeless Irish male immigrants are being fed a Christmas dinner. There are also two acting stalwarts who contribute well to the film: Jim Broadbent as a kindly Irish priest who helps other Irish immigrants; and Julie Walters who is quite funny as a strict Irish landlady of a boarding house of young Irish women.The film is not without flaws including a small-town bully seems too one-dimensional. The role of Eilis' mother could also have been better developed. While Eilis (pronounced Ailish) faces a major dilemma near the end, there seemed to be a hurry to wrap things up. When one must make a major decision in life (as Eilis does), there is often sadness at the choice left behind. Eilis's attitude seemed too one-sided. This inner conflict was better handled in ""The Namesake"", a 2006 independent U.S. film.Despite these flaws, ""Brooklyn"" is still admirable especially for Ronan's performance. In the beginning, Eilis is shy, awkward, out of place, and homesick. Her transition throughout the movie is believable and touching. As a child actress in ""Atonement"" back in 2007, Ronan showed great potential which is proven further in ""Brooklyn"". Let's hope to see more of her."
BROOKLYN,28 January 2016,8/10,"In Brooklyn a timid Irish girl blossoms into an Irish American woman. Yet it's titled after the destination not the heroine. That points to a direct connection between this very Irish film and an essential principle of Jewish theology: Lech le-cha'. The phrase comes from Genesis, where Jehovah commands Abraham to depart his native land for an indeterminate destiny elsewhere. The common reading is: The Lord loves leaving. That is, our destiny is not to rest where we are but to move on. Heroine Eilis (Saorirse Ronan) leaves her mother, sister Rose and village community for the challenges, dangers and ultimately, self-realization of 1950s Brooklyn (Montreal). So the film's title emphasizes her destiny, not her initial self. The film begins and ends with Eilis leaving. In the first scene she leaves her home for the 7 o'clock Sunday Mass her stern employer expects her staff to attend. That is leaving as routine, going somewhere but always to the same place at the same time. That is movement as rut. There is no growth there, no risk. At the end she has left her solitary mother, a well-off suitor and her old world to return to America and the gentlemanly Italian plumber she has secretly married. Eilis may have been tempted to stay. But her malevolent old employer Mrs Kelly reminded her of the meanness of a self-absorbed life, our need to open out, to move on and to grow. In a phrase, Lech le-cha'. One essential tension here is between solitude and community. Ellis's mother survives her husband's and daughter Rose's deaths, now her last daughter's departure, to find herself finally alone. In her abject solitude she can't bear to give Eilis a second goodbye. Rose's early death saved her from wasting her life on her mother's care, as Mrs Kelly warned Eilis, to burden her with guilt. Later, with no clear motive other than to assert her empty power, Mrs Kelly shows she knows of Eilis's marriage. The women form another community. Mrs Keough's Brooklyn boarding house for Irish girls is a community far warmer and livelier than the home Eilis left. In their alliterative names and authority Mrs Keough and Mrs Kelly embody antithetical spirits of discipline and authority. Mrs Keough and the girls help and advise each other. On her first journey Eilis is bolstered by a cabin-mate's advice, which she then passes on to another neophyte on her voyage back.The Brooklyn priest is a model of Christian brotherhood and paternal care, as he registers and pays for Eilis's evening course in bookkeeping. When he invites her to help serve the parish's Christmas dinner to the unemployed Irish men he brings her out of her self- consciousness into a new confidence and spirit. This event is the turning point in her adjustment to America. Even her romance is another departure. At the Irish parish dance she meets the Italian who likes Irish girls, i.e., who himself feels the spirit of moving out, Lech le-cha'. He has outgrown his kid brother's flat statement that the family dislikes the Irish, ""It's a well-known fact."" Ellis's best girlfriend back home didn't feel that ambition to grow, so despite her spirit and beauty she's happy to settle with one of the local rugby boys, despite the embarrassment of oily air and conformist blazer. Or blazing conformity. The Eilis who radiates on her return to Ireland is a far cry from the pallid, green mouse who moved away. She's brighter than ever when her husband spots her on the street, having returned unannounced. The shared Jewish-Irish theme is after all not surprising. Abraham is an avatar of the immigrant experience, which is central to both the Irish and the Jewish experience in America."
BROOKLYN,27 November 2015,8/10,"Brooklyn is new classic. A beautiful love story, and a warm tribute to all whom have traveled far and wide, to come to Ellis island and chase the American dream. Though thoroughly Irish, Brooklyn represents the birth of immigration in the United States. The beginning of the ""melting pot"" that we all know today. It's also a very compelling coming-of-age story. A young Irish girl, who is unfortunate to stick out in her home country, for being deemed too homely to find a nice Irish man (even though she is absolutely stunning by our standards). She comes to America and finds a nice Italian man to fall in love with, and secretly marry, only to come home to attend the wake of a loved one, and inexplicably gets set up with the strapping Irish man that she wouldn't have gotten with before. The place that rejected her all her life is now trying to reel her back in, but too bad Ireland wasn't there for her the whole time. She finds true love in America. The pacing of this story works. The acting is sublime. Saoirse Ronan's performance is stoic, and flat- out terrific. She's a true actress. Though she's been around for quite a while, I can say with this movie, it is her breakout role."
BROOKLYN,19 May 2019,8/10,"Cute and heartfelt, but lacking any real antagonist or conflict, other than the strange amount of opportunity both in Ireland and in America. While this film does a good job to tug at your heartstrings every once in a while, the main thing it really does is convince you that Domhnall Gleeson was in absolutely EVERYTHING last year."
BROOKLYN,2 February 2020,8/10,"Cute and heartfelt, but lacking any real antagonist or conflict, other than the strange amount of opportunity both in Ireland and in America. While this film does a good job to tug at your heartstrings every once in a while, the main thing it really does is convince you that Domhnall Gleeson was in absolutely EVERYTHING last year."
BROOKLYN,5 February 2016,9/10,"From the late nineteenth century to the early 1950's, Ellis Island was the open door into the United States for Europeans looking to chase the American dream. Nothing seemed more heavenly then to be able to live in a place that seemed so inexpensive and massive that everyone had a chance to feel like they could be king. What I mean by that is that they find their riches in happiness rather then wealth. It's safe to say that many people, including most Americans, are still looking for their own American dream, which given how much inflation has risen the cost of living, is harder to find.Back to the history, immigration from Europe had been on the rise once New York City was seen as the welcome mat to the American dream and a better life. The problem is that rather then moving on after completing the process through the gate, they stay put rather then traveling on further. Having been to New York myself, I can say that the city is very intimidating and can scare away the lazy ones very quick. But for those that are willing to trudge through the bad times, as shown through Brooklyn, then happiness isn't too difficult to look for.It's 1952 in the small town of Enniscorthy, Ireland where a quiet and introverted young woman, Eilis (played by Saoirse Ronan) is getting ready to make her move to New York. This was arraigned by her sister Rose who hopes that her sister can find a better life, despite objections from her mother. Her boat ride across the Atlantic at first proves unpleasant when a combination of food poisoning and seasickness leave's her feeling miserable and vulnerable. A kind passenger, a woman who's an experienced traveler, helps her and even gives her instructions on how to get through immigration without trouble.She settles in a boarding house in Brooklyn, that's home to a bunch of young woman. Eilis is constantly teased by her roommates and finds that her shyness isn't suiting her new job at a local department store. With help from a local priest, father Flood (played by Jim Broadbent), she's enrolled at a local college, taking classes on bookkeeping. At the same time, she meets an Italian plumber Tony (played by Emory Cohen) that becomes her boyfriend, which raises her spirits, making Brooklyn feel like home more often. But a tragedy sends her back to Ireland to help things out, questioning what she really wants.When I came into Brooklyn, I thought it was going to be nothing more then a typical immigration story. I was right, but was also surprised. From what I've described, there really isn't much of a plot, but rather then a slice of real life. I kept expecting an evil roommate or boss that wanted to stop her dreams, but thankfully, that never happens. I like movies that don't feel like they have to stick to a plot. The simple coming of age story of a young woman is this movie needs as long as Eilis is interesting.Saoirse Ronan plays her with such honesty and care that I really would have liked to know her character's life after the movie. Saoirse can use this as clear evidence that she'll have no problem getting work for her adult career. Brooklyn may sound like a typical coming of age story, but the story allows her to evolve gracefully at the right pacing. There are plenty of moments she's simply watching the city, the coast, and even the Irish landscape that both allows her to think and to take in some great photography. This reminded me of a Hayao Miyazaki movie in this sense. I'll give this nine Brooklyn postcards out of ten. This may be one of my new favorite ""coming of age"" stories. Brooklyn treats it's teenage character with honesty and like a relative you'd want to look out for. I definitely recommend this immigration story."
BROOKLYN,17 January 2016,10/10,"Brooklyn, based on the novel of the same name by Colm Toibin, is another film of this year, or even the past couple years where you have a great film under the control and excellence of a great female lead (here in this case is by Saoirse Ronan) and it is a film that is a great showcase for an actress because it is so precise and so well written and understanding of a young woman and from her viewpoint. The film is good enough on it's own, but with the added charm and sensitivity of Ronan's performance it is really elevated to levels of greatness. I am also quite pleased that this is another film where we get a really grounded and realistic portrayal of women that is both understanding of them, but also completely tells the story from their viewpoint and in a world of very male dominated films and where some female roles are unflattering, or unfortunate stereotypes, this is one that feels real and authentic as well as breathing life into something that I think whether male, or female that you can both identify with and you really do in a sense fall in love with this character and can relate and feel with her on a number of levels which is one of the great charms of this film. Ronan's character Ellis is originally from Ireland, and sets off to America for a better life for herself. Once in America (Brooklyn, New York to be exact) she is extremely shy, nervous and intimidated by a world that is very much different from where she originally came from. Ellis, does not have too many friends, or acquaintances around her, but much to her good fortune she falls for a local plumber named Tony, who is head over heels in love with her from the moment they meet. At first, Ellis is a bit hesitant and awkward in the relationship, but as time goes by and Tony really seems to be a great guy and also seems to have intentions that are in all the right and best places and ways. Because that she is now in love with Tony, and him with her, Ellis becomes a whole new person and seems to come out of her inner shell and show the world her true self that she had up to then kept hidden while she was in New York. Suddenly she is more chatty and delivers a much better customer service job at the place of her employment which is much to the manager's and customer's benefits, but Ellis also seems to grow as a person as well and develop confidence for herself and is able to tackle and handle situations of various sizes with an epic amount of confidence and assurance. This transformation is really something to watch and Ronan does an excellent job of portraying a once timid and shy girl who quickly becomes confident and sure of herself and also becomes a very lovely young woman in the process and we can also tell by the way she works and interacts with others that she is also a lot happier. I won't say too much more because I do not want to spoil the movie, but circumstances do come up later on in the film where Ellis is forced to make some tough decisions. The decisions become all the more difficult because of the people who she loves around her as well as having a strong sense of loyalty to many different people and places. This is further complicated because a lot of the people in Ellis's life think that they know what is best for her, or how she should live her life, when in reality they are only looking out for themselves and their own self interests and not for Ellis's. Unfortunately because of this, Ellis is manipulated in a vast number of situations and each decision for her future as well as the present becomes increasingly more complicated for her. This is a film that works well as a fish out of water type story as well as a romance and one of my personal favourite aspects of the film is that it is about a woman who completely discovers herself and that she has as much ability to do things and make decisions as well as anybody else and when she starts to do that you are with her every step of the way. This is a beautiful film in both the way it was filmed as well as with the story that offers great insight into all of it's characters as well as telling a story that is full of beauty and the same time hope as well as teaching people to learn to be self confident and discover themselves. Ronan is great here and the supporting cast is all excellent as well. Nick Hornby, who adapted the screenplay gives us another film like his great, About a Boy, that is so rich with characters and is ultimately a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will deeply move you as well. This is truly one of 2015's best films and I hope more people discover it while it is still in theatres."
BROOKLYN,5 November 2015,9/10,Satires Ronan gives an award worthy performance as an Irish immigrant in 1952 Brooklyn. Homesick until she meets a guy but circumstances make her go back to Ireland. Will she stay or come back to Brooklyn? Don't take any inference from the title Brooklyn.It's a beautiful story presented in a straight forward way. The males are not bashed. A lot of information is communicated over the dinner table. The letters in the drawer was a bit heavy handed and the snow inside over the goodbye note was a bit of a weather oddity.It's a small movie that looks good on the big screen. See it in a crowded theater where only the heartless will have dry eyes.
BROOKLYN,7 February 2016,7/10,"CHARMING. If I were to describe BROOKLYN in one word it would be CHARMING. This movie is utterly charming.Based on the book of the same name by Colm Toibin, BROOKLYN tells the story of Irish immigrant Eilis who leaves her life in Ireland for a new life in America in the 1950's. Through the course of this film we watch Eilis grow from a shy unsure immigrant to confident young woman.Saoirse Ronan well deserves her Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Eilis. She has stunning eyes that convey the emotions and thoughts of her character and they seem to grow wiser through the course of the film. The first half of the film drags abit as Eilis - and therefore, we the audience - struggles to find her place. Thank goodness veterans Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent are around to help us through that part of the movie. They all but disappear as Eilis grows more confident and takes command of this film as she circumnavigates relationships with Italian-American Tony (Emory Cohen) and then a suitor back in Ireland (Domhnall Gleeson - who seems to be in every film these days).Director John Crowley divides this movie into 3 pieces visually. The first 3rd is subdued as Eilis gets ready to leave Ireland, the 2nd part becomes more vibrant as she comes into her own in Brooklyn while the 3rd is back in a much more colorful (in places) and drab (in other places) Ireland, as if Eilis is seeing her hometown through new eyes. It was a subtle, but strong, touch.BROOKLYN is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. While I liked the film and thought is was, (yes), charming, I can't really say that I think it belongs in the Best Picture category. It is a very fine motion picture, one that will charm you, but... Best Picture? I don't think so.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
BROOKLYN,3 March 2017,4/10,"Brooklyn: 4 out of 10. For such a gentle passive costume drama about a 1950's emigrant from Ireland Brooklyn evoked a surprising amount of ire. First of I am surprised that Saoirse Ronan was nominated for an Oscar in this role. She isn't a bad actress by any means but her character is so passive and banal and inconsistent that it is hard to get a read on the performance. Leaving aside the main character for a minute the film has a few other issues. While the interiors are filmed well the exteriors (Particularly the ones that are supposed to be in Brooklyn) seem out of a made for PBS movie from the mid-eighties rather than a modern film. One-half expects Raul Julia to pop up in at any moment doing a riff on Casablanca. The remaining characters, with one notable exception doing her best Margaret Hamilton impression, are played as very nice people. Almost too nice. It is as if a Mary Sue convention let out next door. All the characters also only seem to exist to help, enable and be nice to our heroine. They rarely seem to have lives of their own. Our heroine, by any measure, is a horrible self-centered person. I am unsure if the film even realizes this. Ronan plays her as a passive aggressive social wallflower yet the script seems to have written her as a predatory self-centered narcissist. As a result, we have a character asking a man to walk her home not because she is interested but so she can abandon a new young immigrant girl she finds disagreeable (The film mind you gives us no reason to find this ancillary character disagreeable which makes her declaration even more jarring) Ronan's character then proceeds to tell bigger lies and inflict even greater cruelties on her loved ones and those whose only crime is being nice to her. Yet the film seems strangely oblivious to its protagonist's cruelty. A wisp of a film only promoted by a surprise Oscar nomination and a veneer of a decent date night film. It disappoints on almost all levels."
BROOKLYN,22 May 2016,9/10,"I cannot praise this picture highly enough; in recent months I have seen the likes of The Martian, The Revenant, The Big Short and many more but Brooklyn is the best of the lot! And I ask myself why? The story is of a young Irish girl immigrant to the USA hoping to better herself. She meets and falls in love.....Not a lot really happens in the movie yet this is a superbly powerful love story; and because the lead players and all the supporting cast are so compelling and charismatic, it is perhaps that factor which makes this picture so good.This film will have many viewers-as it did me-laughing and then in tears:9/10."
BROOKLYN,7 December 2015,9/10,"The immigrant experience is practically synonymous with America, but how much do we really know or understand about that experience? When asked, most Americans can quickly identify an ethnicity (or several) to which they can trace their origins. Whether it was your parents, your grandparents (as in my case), or someone further back, someone in your family history had to be ""the first"", the one (or one of several members of one family) who, for any number of reasons, crossed an ocean or a river or a land mass and began your family's history in America. These were people who left behind everything they had known and started a new life in a new place full of unknowns. That first American in your family might have even made the trip alone, without a familiar face in sight. That's ""Brooklyn"" (PG-13, 1:51).The film tells an immigration story that includes many of the factors described above, but also differs from what most of us would consider ""a typical immigration story"" in some important ways. This particular Irish immigrant (1) came to the U.S. alone, (2) happens to be female and (3) arrived in the early 50s – not the 1750s or 1850s, but the 1950s. This unusual, but not unheard-of combination of factors makes the story of this one young woman all the more interesting. Second-generation Irish actress Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis (pronounced: AYE-lish) Lacey, who is one sick character. In the first half of the film, Eilis goes from being sick of home, to sea sick, to home sick, to love sick – and then her sister gets sick. Wordplay aside, Eilis has experiences that transform her, even as they transfix the audience.Eilis has a clever mind, a strong spirit and a pretty face, but finds little to keep her in tiny Enniscorthy, Ireland. She lives there with her older sister, Rose (Fiona Glascott), and mother, Mary (Jane Brennan), but with no interest in any of her village's male population, only working a day or two per week for the nasty shopkeeper Miss Kelly (Bríd Brennan) and nothing better on the horizon, Eilis decides to look beyond that horizon. Rose makes arrangements with Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), an Irish-born priest living in Brooklyn, New York, to help Eilis relocate there. She'll have a place to live – in a Brooklyn boarding house with other unmarried young women from Ireland – and a job as a sales girl at a neighborhood department store. ""All"" young Eilis has to do is get on that boat.Eilis finds it difficult to leave home – and then finds her new situation even more challenging. After a rough crossing that makes her physically ill, Eilis lands at Ellis Island (see what the writer did there?),has to try making it through immigration screening without being put in quarantine for looking sickly, and then find her way to her new home to start her new life. Eilis is quiet and shy to the point of being socially awkward and even seeming rude, making it tough for her to make friends or even satisfy her supervisor that she can even do an adequate job of serving customers. Eilis is also driven to distraction by how badly she misses her family and her home back in Ireland. Father Flood shows up to offer some comfort – and an opportunity to better herself by attending night school to learn bookkeeping. The tough, but compassionate Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters), and some of the other girls' in her boarding house, help Eilis adjust and start to come out of her shell. But what makes the biggest difference for Eilis is the attention of a sweet and charming Italian-American boy named Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen).Just after things get serious between Eilis and Tony, bad news from Ireland compels Eilis to go back home to visit for about a month. Tony is afraid she won't come back to Brooklyn – and he has reason to worry. Eilis' visit to her hometown starts to look like one big conspiracy to get her to stay. Her mother is complaining about her loneliness with Eilis living in America – and has committed Eilis to attend the wedding of her best friend, Nancy (Eileen O'Higgins), scheduled for the week after Eilis was supposed to get back on the ship to America. Nancy tricks Eilis into a blind date with a very eligible local bachelor named Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson). Then, a shipping firm where Rose used to work begs Eilis to help them fix their books – a favor that turns into a temporary part-time job, with hints of a more permanent position becoming available. Meanwhile, Eilis has received several letters from Tony which she has placed in a drawer unopened. It seems that Eilis has a major decision to make. What she does next is a spoiler and I don't do spoilers.The details of Eilis' story are fictional and may not match those of a majority of immigrants to the U.S., but her basic struggles and her heart match most of those immigrants. And they represent us. This is a relatable and utterly charming film which should not be missed. It's a simple tale that's wonderfully told with the help of great costumes, beautiful cinematography and story-telling that's old-fashioned, but doesn't feel outdated within the early 1950s setting. Eilis' particular set of circumstances are well-researched and not uncommon for this particular time and place. Nick Hornby's adaptation of Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel (set partly in the Irish author's actual hometown) stays very close to the original story. Both the book and screenplay take one ordinary immigrant's tale and infuses it with just the right amount of drama and a surprising amount of emotion. The film's effectiveness also owes much to the layered performance of Ronan who seems to mature right before our eyes. All things considered, going to ""Brooklyn"" is a trip well worth taking.

BROOKLYN,26 December 2016,7/10,"Once again, there is evidence that the Academy gets Oscar-happy about films that are OK, but not as good as all that. ""Brooklyn"" was down for three, including - most incomprehensibly of all - Best Picture. There is plenty of good acting to be had in this tale of 1950s emigration from Ireland to Brooklyn, notably from Julie Walters as a guesthouse landlady and of course (the more-justifiably Oscar-nominated) Saoirse Ronan in the starring role, but rather few issues are raised here - except the large-enough, though here very broad-brush, issues of emigration, separation and longing for home. Nor is this piece clever or spectacular (any possible crowd scenes are cut down to make sure we don't realise how tight the effects budget is).To be reasonable, one might put the film down as ""well-observed"" and interesting historically, but that is about the limits of it. And first and foremost it has a remarkable talent to ""call it a day"" just when it begins to get interesting. Irish falls in love with (Americanised) Italian, and the most menace we encounter is from the mouth of an 8-year-old. A flicker of danger comes as our heroine seems to be falling for two lads at the same time, yet she goes back to New York anyway, and everything is fine.Forever...Creative tension it ain't."
BROOKLYN,10 December 2015,7/10,"The tale of a young Irish girl's immigration to Brooklyn, New York in the 1950s was led by the powerful performance of Saoirse Ronan. This young actress has proved herself in many films but I feel like this is the first movie she has carried on her own. Her maturity shines through and she handled the terrors of homesickness in a brand new country, sorrow, joy, and love as good as any other actress that will be up on the screen this year. I had not heard much about this movie and feared the pace would be slow but under John Crowley's direction, the plot moved swiftly depositing Ronan's Eilis in one tough situation after the next. A viewer gets the sense of the tight, cramped spaces of Brooklyn but as she grows more comfortable, we come to see the beauty that makes up the American dream.See more reviews at swilliky.com"
BROOKLYN,11 November 2015,8/10,"When the older generation talk about them ""not making films like that anymore"", this should be the film they go and see. This is a film that will appeal greatly to the ""Marigold Hotel"" set, and from the audience mix in the well-attended Tuesday night screening I attended, that message is getting out there. Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis, a teenage girl growing up in Ireland's County Wexford with her older sister and widowed mother in the early 1950's. Short on opportunities for a decent life, she is sponsored into a new city and a new job by Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), a friend in the New York clergy. Desperately homesick, we follow her trials and tribulations as she eventually settles into her new life through the love of a good (albeit sometimes un-favourably smelling) young man (an impressive Emory Cohen). Torn between her family duty at home in Ireland, where lurks another beau in the form of Domhnall Gleeson (""Ex Machina"", ""About Time""), Eilis is caught in a love triangle with a 5,000 km hypotenuse.Ronan is mesmeric in the role of Eilis. Most famous for her dramatic role in the much-underrated adventure film ""Hanna"", and more recently in last year's superb ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", here she has to carry a demanding starring role and she does so with great skill. The supporting cast are also excellent, with Jane Brennan in particular turning in a heartbreaking performance as Eilis's mother (albeit, I felt, in one of the more two-dimensionally scripted roles in the film). Also of particular note is national treasure Julie Walters, hilarious as the landlady Mrs Kehoe coming out with some cracking dialogue, and Jenn Murray (set to appear in Potter spin-off ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"") as the kookie and man-hungry new guest-house arrival who is a sheer comic delight to watch. The script is by Nick Hornby (""About a Boy""), based on the novel by Colm Tóibín, and zips along pleasantly with only the occasional missed step (there was one line in particular that reeked of cheese).The director is John Crowley, but credit should also go to the technical team that makes the US scenes just glow with nostalgia. The cinematography of Yves Bélanger (""Wild"", ""Dallas Buyers Club"") is exquisite, especially in the more romantic scenes with Ronan wearing rich red costumes (by Odile Dicks-Mireaux). And the set decoration and special effects make scenes such as the ones at Coney Island very effective without having to break a (presumably) limited budget. All in all, this is a film that, if there is any justice in the world, I would love to see feature prominently in the Oscar art categories.With some bittersweet twists and beautifully shot, this is a fill-em (to use the Irish vernacular) that should appeal to a broad audience looking for a romantic story well told on the big screen. By the way, imho the trailer gives too much of the plot away so I would recommend avoiding.(A graphical version of this review is available at bob-the-movie- man.com)."
BROOKLYN,21 January 2020,,"It's a bit too straightforward for my tastes, with little in the way of intrigue or unexpected story turns. However, for what it is, it's quite beautifully realised. Easy to watch, but won't set the world on fire."
BROOKLYN,28 October 2016,9/10,"When I viewed this beautiful film, I was taken by the love story between the Irish girl, Eilis Lacey, played by Saoirse Ronan and her Italian American boyfriend, Tony Fiorello, played by Emery Cohen, who falls in love with her at first sight. She is seeking a new life in America and his love and total dedication to winning her hand gives her the confidence to overcome her shyness and bewilderment. A dinner shared with Tony's baseball-loving and welcoming Italian family, seals the relationship.Eilis also has strong allies in her sponsor Father Flood, played by Jim Broadbent, and landlady Mrs. Kehoe, played by Julie Walters. When Eilis loses her sister Rose, who was very close to her, she returns home to Ireland. Tony, who doesn't want to lose her, insists they marry before she leaves. Nevertheless, the temptation to return home is strong and is made more attractive by a new male interest, who seeks to marry her with almost as much zeal as the romantic Tony. The movie is enhanced by the amusing conversations among the girls at Mrs. Kehoe's boarding house. The youthful dance scenes from the 1950's show how the opposite sex connected in the years long before internet dating sites. The soup kitchen dinner scenes for the down and out show the hard lot suffered by the Irish immigrants, described by Father Flood as the men ""who built the highways, bridges and tunnels"". His wisdom and compassion also enabled young immigrants like Eilis to settle in their new home.This movie gives a sympathetic and somewhat sentimental view of Irish immigrants but is also a healthy dose of realism. It is very reaffirming of the way it shows how new immigrants were able to use their new opportunities while acknowledging the the pain of newcomers. Most of all, the story shows a charming love story against the background of mid 20th century America and Ireland."
BROOKLYN,25 January 2020,6/10,"Gets a little sappy form time to time, really so in the beginning. but halfway though it get better and end with a good ending. overall not much of note, just a average decent film.6/10: decent"
BROOKLYN,29 November 2015,9/10,"Looming skyscrapers in a distant land, the kindness of strangers, love and hope for a better life; such things open the eyes of Eilis, a smart and insular immigrant to 1950s Brooklyn, to opportunities she did not have in the Irish countryside. While at first lonely and homesick in this new cityscape, Eilis is soon enthralled with the bright possibilities, encouraged by all she is learning and charmed by the people she meets. She breaks free from her shell and shines in this radiant, unfamiliar realm. Returning to Ireland for what she hopes is a brief stay, Eilis both sees through and is seen in a luminous and different light. Both worlds, New York and her Irish home, now pull the new and improved Eilis in different directions.Saoirse Ronan is spectacular in her performance as Eilis. She really makes this Sundance hit come alive. It is comforting, as always, to see a film that does not depend on explosions, computer graphics and alien contagions to entertain. There is a deeper pleasure here, one that pulls at mind, spirit, body and heart together. Visuals, story, organization, acting, intriguing characters and more, all come together well."
BROOKLYN,2 June 2016,8/10,"Nostalgic without being overly maudlin. Also does not play up the ""Irish Need Not Apply"" angle but there is some honest Irish wit and wisdom. And spaghetti lessons as well!Loved how the tension in this film is built. It's so different from other films, that all too often need to push the ante up into shades of risk, fear and DefCon 99. (To be fair, I'm not entirely done with those, ""Calvary"" has more modern stakes and moves, but an even more compelling priest than Jim Broadbent's excellent Father here.)I must be getting old, as watching these mostly pleasant and charming people made me feel like me own Mom. I did find myself reflecting on how distance has changed in this modern facetime on a jet world (which is not without its own charm) versus the old days of an older world. Costly phone calls that were hard to hear, or getting news via an actual letter. Recommended for watching with your in-laws, maybe they came here from Burma or Iran, and maybe they'll have some tales to share for dessert."
BROOKLYN,9 December 2016,6/10,"John Crowley directed the Oscar-nominated film, Brooklyn, in 2015. Starring Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen, Brooklyn tells the story of a young Irish girl looking to make her way in America. Saoirse Ronan had sadly never been on my radar before, but she gave a tour-de- force performance in Brooklyn. Capturing the difficulties of needing to leave home for personal growth, yet romanticizing what you left behind, Ronan captures the emotions in a perfectly beautiful way. Fo everyone that has ever left home, or felt like an outsider, Brooklyn is for you. Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) a young, sheltered girl living in Ireland is having a difficult time finding gainful employment or a husband. Her family, her sister especially, is confident in her abilities. Eilis is a smart young lady and is destined for better things than she has in her native country. Her priest sponsors a move to America for her, and although she is nervous to leave, she hopes for the riches that America seems to offer. Once she arrives, Eilis feels terribly out of place, and wretchedly homesick, but determined to make good on creating the life she sees for herself, she persists. Eventually, Eilis gets a job at a department store, enrolls in night school for bookkeeping, and meets Tony (Emory Cohen), the first person to make her feel like home might be with a person, then at a place.Saoirse Ronan wows in her role as the timid yet determined Eilis Lacey. Ronan received a great deal of Oscar buzz for her part, and all of the attention was well-deserved. The role of Eilis was a controlled, understated performance that necessitated most of the emotion to be conveyed through the eyes. Eilis was a non-confrontational sort, a girl that knew her place and rarely spoke out, though once she felt comfortable around you, she could talk for days. The role was also one that straddled the line between determined and adaptable. Eilis was determined to create the life she had imagined for herself, yet she was adaptable enough to willingly change how she achieved what she hoped for. Brooklyn was exceptionally acted, with a great script and a wonderful score, a great way to spend a couple hours."
BROOKLYN,24 December 2015,4/10,"Brooklyn follows a young Irish woman who decides to move to America. While there, she falls in love with Super Mario, erm, an Italian plumber, who is probably unrelated. The movie had a lot of good ideas going for it. The plot as a whole was setting up for something that could lead to some interesting drama and character dynamics, and the last act went in a really engaging direction that I think is totally realistic, especially considering the characters. Story-wise, it had just about everything going for it. And sometimes, it actually worked. Where this movie fails is just about everything else. The acting proves to be just alright. Saoirse Ronan isn't breaking any new ground here, her performance is just fine, as is the rest of the main cast. The secondary characters seemed to be the best actors of them all, but common to secondary characters they were given very little screen time. While some scenarios were fun or well-set up, even they proved to be mercilessly dull. That's really a lot of this movie. I didn't care about any of the characters, which is largely in part to the acting. Emory Cohen with his superiorly awkward performance tended to be the reason for this a lot of the time. Similar to the first time I saw the movie, he was one of the worst parts of it. He's over-the-top about how awkward he is, and even when he should be comfortable he simply doesn't give off that impression. And even if the characters were well- written, I don't think that his character could've been salvaged. And unfortunately, a lot of the writing is rather bland. Brooklyn is a film containing two of my biggest peeves in film, one of which being uninteresting characters of a specific type. That type is young wealthy gossiping women. They just aren't interesting to me at all. Their conversations are boring and void of any real substance, and especially here where all they seem to do is complain and laugh at characters that are rarely seen (if at all) in the film. They simply aren't interesting, so I found it hard to get invested in them the vast majority of them. I know that people like them do exist, so I can't dock points for it, but it didn't make this movie any easier to digest. Of the above characters, Emily Bett Rickards' character was particularly frustrating. I don't know if it was because I can't picture her in the 1950s after seeing her solely in 'Arrow' or if she simply doesn't sound or look the part, but her character was noticeably out of place amongst everyone else. My second pet peeve, which is an actual flaw in the movie, is the fact that it baits tears so often. The movie tries so hard to make it's audience cry, as if that'll make the movie better. To me, it kind of does, but it has to be done right, typically through touching or heartbreaking character moments with emotional weight. In Brooklyn, it's so obvious. The movie goes for tear bait in the first act, before any of the characters are even developed. So how is it that I'm expected to cry over people that I haven't gotten to know? No amount of generically sad music or crying Irish women is going to make me feel one bit for these characters. And even when the movie tries it closer to the third act, it's still a miserable failure. Because like I already said none of the characters are interesting and the movie is painfully dull. I have no reason to care about these characters, and having seen the bait so early on I know that that's exactly what the movie's trying to do, so like a smart fish I don't bite. Overall Brooklyn kind of sucks. Sure, some story aspects are good and well-set up, but the execution is just bad. The movie as a whole is rather dull, from the acting to the writing to the characters. It's a whole lot of nothing, and while it wasn't boring at the least, it's not like it was well-made. I liked a couple shots and ideas, end of story. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. I'm sure that there will be and are plenty of people who absolutely love it, but I'm not one of them."
BROOKLYN,8 October 2015,8/10,"Often movies have a magical quality as you're viewing them. Some will demand your undivided attention, others will hypnotize your senses, leaving them to simply wash over you with their exuberance and classic filmmaking procedures. In the case of John Crowley's ""Brooklyn,"" the latter is certainly the case. There comes a moment in the film when you are taken in by the film's classic style filmmaking, and tenderly thought-provoking performances from its cast. Director Crowley, in partnership with Oscar-nominated scribe Nick Hornby, create a beautiful and sensitive love story that is everything a Nicholas Sparks film adaptation wishes it could be. With a vibrant turn from Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan at the helm, ""Brooklyn"" utilizes all of its tools in its arsenal to convey a potent message of love and family.""Brooklyn"" tells the story of Ellis Lacey (Ronan), who in 1950s Ireland and New York, has to choose between two men and two countries. One is the charismatic Italian plumber Tony (Emory Cohen) while the other is the reserved yet sensitive Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson). Both are making a case for Ellis' love.The film is helmed with a strong and undeniable confidence from Saoirse Ronan. Feeling the internal battle just pouring out of her in nearly every sense and every scene, Ronan finds Ellis' struggle and wears it on her sleeve. She doesn't just have fear of choice, she goes through a barrage of emotions, and we actively see the character progress in each milestone that she hits throughout. It begins with the yearning and devastating separation from her family in Ireland, before gradually being brought to a yearn for acceptance in a new city. Her mild but rewarding progression into comfort and confidence is shown before being abruptly ripped away when tragedy strikes. Every instance is felt in Ronan's work, all of which is authentically true and vivaciously real. It's one of her best turns, and further proof that her name will be on our lips for quite some years.After breaking out with a scene-stealing turn in Derek Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Emory Cohen shows his sensitive and charming side of his range, resulting in an equally measured and tantalizing performance to his co-star. Don't sleep on this kid. Domhnall Gleeson's reservations to Jim Farrell is haunting in a role that doesn't call for many words or emotions. You can see the ache and pain in his movements, desperate for love and an overwhelming feeling of being lost. In a few scenes, Julie Walters as Mrs. Kehoe sustains as a surprisingly comic relief in a very serious drama. Her stoic, passive demeanor is such a treat to watch in her scenes of interaction with the girls of the boarding house in which Ellis is staying.Screenwriter Nick Hornby constructs the story with real life emotion, taking very few short cuts for its characters. He allows Ellis' feelings to make the journey in each instance in which she faces them. The foundation of Tony and Ellis is honest, and rings true as something we'd see in any instance within our own lives. Where he really shines in the connection between Ellis and her family. Thousands of miles away, and with little interaction on screen, you are heartbroken and pulled through the ringer as Ronan exemplifies the loss of her family and determination to see them once again. If there is a chink in Hornby's armor, it's the case he creates for the audience for Ellis to stay in Ireland. Up until the second half of the film, Hornby makes his case for New York, I'd only wish he made a more compelling case for Ireland, giving the audience a more fruitful and difficult dilemma in making their own decision about where Ellis should be.One must acknowledge how impeccably constructed the film is from head to toe. Crowley assembles a dynamite team behind the camera, who all standout in their own right. Cinematographer Yves Bélanger, with a yellow hue and soft palate, capture the country and the city to stunning results. He frames each scene intimately, capturing the heart and emotion of every word spoken. Production Designer François Séguin and Set Decorator Suzanne Cloutier capture the 50's homes as if plucked from the time period themselves, along with transporting us to a foreign land we can only dream to visit. Odile Dicks- Mireaux's magnetic costume work elevates each performance, allowing the actors to fully engage with their characters and the time. And finally, the music of Michael Brook is a breathtaking swell of emotion, creating moments that will surely bring you to tears. ""Brooklyn"" is a damn fine movie, following all the classic beats that we've grown to love about the most timeless love stories. ""Brooklyn"" will join the ranks of those timeless stories in the coming years. It's a joyful and heart aching film that stands as one of the year's best, and a sure-fire contender for several Academy Awards.Read more @ (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"
BROOKLYN,11 September 2019,8/10,"I enjoyed Brooklyn thoroughly. The 2 leads and especially Saoirse Ronan are excellent. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Romantic and heartwarming."
BROOKLYN,16 March 2016,8/10,"What I liked: 1.Saoirse Ronan as the protagonist Eilis is absolutely fantastic. She brings an astounding amount of subtlety in her performance. Her facial gestures, her eyes, her voice,etc. everything felt so natural and so expressive. She beautifully blends the character's independence and strength with requisite amounts of vulnerability. I will probably go so far as to say that the film might not have worked so well had someone else been cast instead of her.2.The supporting cast which consists of budding youngsters like Emory Cohen and Domhnall Gleeson as well as veteran stalwarts like Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent is also great.3.I really engaged with the themes explored in the screenplay by Nick Hornby which is based on the novel by Colm Tóibín. This really is a story of a character who is trying to figure out what life path she wants to tread with the element of immigration blended in it. Eilis starts out as a young girl completely bored with her life in Ireland. So she decides to go to America when the opportunity presents itself. But in America, she finds it very difficult to adjust to the new way of life and she feels extremely homesick. But later in the film certain events take place that force her to make the choice between her home in Ireland and the new world i.e. America. I think the love triangle also works because of the way the two romances in a sense symbolise this dilemma of Eilis which involves the decision of choosing to stay in Ireland or go to America. But towards the end, we certainly see her embolden and take control of her life. Her growth gets subtly hinted at by reversals of certain small scenes that took place towards the beginning.4.John Crowley's direction is almost pitch perfect. He creates a beautifully humanistic and nostalgic tone for the film. He treats each and every character with respect and gets the best performance out of everyone. He also understands the screenplay beautifully and knows exactly when to quickly cut to a face to catch a reaction or when to stay on a face to capture the changes in the facial expressions. The film moves seamlessly and the director deserves all the credit for that.5.The production design and the score of the film are also impeccable. The film looks beautiful. The vibrant colours, the meticulous set designs to accurately depict the period and the score which oozes nostalgic charm all come together perfectly.What I didn't like:1.This is probably a bit of a nitpick, but I would have liked the film to dwell a little more on some of the elements of the story. Crowley could have taken a little more time on some scenes and some characters to further strengthen the potency of the emotions. I felt certain elements were a bit rushed.It is clear that my positives for the film comprehensively outweigh the negatives. This is a very sweet, heartfelt, touching film about a character trying to find her place in the world. Driven by a fantastic lead performance and great direction with an equally impressive script, Brooklyn is certainly a treat."
BROOKLYN,8 February 2016,5/10,"If you really are interested in the heart of an Irish Catholic girl, this picture will have you blubbing within five minutes and keep you at it for over an hour. For me, it was a ten-hankie job. Although I couldn't really give a damn for the frigid girl's future. She seems to have nothing to do with anything modern at all. Lord knows why she's off to Brooklyn, puking all the way. When she finally gets on a swimming costume on Coney Island, her mound of Venus is enormous and unshadowed by any camel toe. But, ah, she's a charmin' lassie, after all, and she does fall for the Italian boy who shows an interest. She actually has sex with him after he proposes. Then her Mammy dies and she has to rush back to Ireland without him. There she falls in with a whole crowd, including Jim the son and heir of the town's biggest store. But the town gossip has heard from Brooklyn and knows she's married. ""My name is Ellish Fiorello,"" she states and leaves for Brooklyn next day, falling into her husband's arms there. It's a wrenching tale, if you can care enough. It should get the star an Oscar later this year."
BROOKLYN,21 September 2018,7/10,"There are different ways to judge a movie. Is it absolutely necessary for every film to be totally ""real?"" Or are there different niches in the market for different people?For someone who wants something less sappy than a Hallmark production, but not as a gritty or cynical as The Sopranos, Brooklyn may hit the spot. I've read several comments discussing the lack of edge or character development. They are correct, but perhaps some people just want to see a sweet coming-of-age love story without too much grit and gristle. Should they be denied options that fit their taste?Having said that, there are some pros and cons worth mentioning. It's true that our main character rarely changes her facial expression or shows much emotion. But she is supposed to be ""green,"" in most senses of that expression. There are such people. It's not unrealistic that a small town Irish Catholic virgin in 1952 may be quiet and obedient. Her ""pure"" look is not an invention. That actress really is from Ireland and really looked like that at the time.I thought it was interesting to see how despite ethnic differences, being Catholic can be a bonding agent among immigrant Irish and Italians. She doesn't date a Jewish guy or an Episcopalian. 
Although interestingly they chose what I assume is a Jewish actor with soft features to play the Italian. He didn't have the edgy qualities one often associates with those groups in that place and time, nor the facial characteristics.But that type of shy, inexperienced neighborhood boy definitely existed and still does in Brooklyn. Commenters have wondered why he was so accepting of her faults. But clearly he had very little experience with girls, and was overwhelmed with gratitude that she liked him. There are guys like that. They don't want to stir the pot by complaining, thereby risk losing someone they feel may be above their station.Although our main girl's behavior upon return to Ireland seems to have upset many commenters, please remember that movie characters don't have to do the right thing or be loveable. Ironically some of the same people who felt that this picture was unrealistic, were upset that she was too real!Because let's face it people. A young girl could easily get caught up in the moment of her first puppy love without taking in the big picture. Then when the initial excitement dies down, she may realize that she hasn't explored the myriad other options for love and life, that would be available to her if she remains single.I can totally see a newly confident girl going back home to a small pond from a big sea, viewing things through new lenses, and being tempted by options.Ultimately it comes down to this: How realistic do you need every film to be, and what is ""real"" to one person may not be real to another. I watched the couple eat spaghetti together and then walk home. I wondered if they felt bloated or had garlic breath, but like in many romantic films, there is no sign of that. In a Ben Stiller film, there would probably by overkill on that.There is some genuine homesickness, some mortality, some gossip and resentment, and a little sea sickness. But the grimy ruggedness of mid century Ireland and Brooklyn were probably not represented with attention to detail. On the other hand, this young woman had multiple chaperones to shield her from it, so perhaps she lived with blinders on. In conclusion, if you want graphic reality, you will be disappointed. If you want to look at a starkly beautiful face, recall at least the surface agony and ecstasy of early post-adolescence and feel good overall, you'll enjoy this. I was actually pleased to be entertained and not feel like showering afterward."
BROOKLYN,7 August 2016,7/10,"I am generally not a fan of the Romance cinematic genre. It's just not typically my thing as it happens. This established, I was relatively surprised that I wound up quite digging the 2015 international romantic drama and thrice Oscar nominated ""Brooklyn"".Saoirse Ronan is purely transcendent as a young Irish girl torn between two bi-national beaus in the recent aftermath of a planet torn apart by World War II. Her character of Eilis is initially presented to us as plain and unremarkable. However, we will gradually and distinctly come to recognize the blossoming of a burgeoning woman who is becoming progressively independent and self-assured by film's end, the metamorphosis paralleling as it does her absorption into the self-determination of the American culture.Most due recognition must also be heaped upon Costume Designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux, who resolutely nails the wardrobe of the day while endowing an elegantly resplendent exclamation point to practically every single scene we see over the course of the at once bittersweet and beautifully told tale of ""Brooklyn""."
BROOKLYN,15 February 2016,8/10,"A very understated tearjerker, well directed by John Crowley, who uses lingering close-ups and hand-held cameras to convey the intimacy of Saoirse Ronan's perceptions, which, in fact, is where the drama takes place. Ronan sparingly uses her alabaster face to be a passive observer of the events that directly involve her, but she also effectively conveys her emotions through slight facial twitches, particularly through her mouth, which alternately tightens and widens based on the conflict of the moment. She plays a young, inexperienced Irish woman who moves to the United States in search of a better life and falls in love with an Italian plumber (Emory Cohen); when an unforeseen tragedy calls her home, she falls for a middle-class gentleman (Domhnall Gleeson) who promises her the better Irish life she yearned for but could not attain. It's set in the Fifties, so proper manners are observed and emotions rarely verbalized and it becomes a flaw of the film: at one point Ronan's shy and conservative character breaks unexpectedly (and confusingly) with the mores of the time; and both her male suitors are a little too perfect, never uttering a wrong comment or doing anything less than honorable. Yet the film has the power to move, owing to both Crowley's commitment to his lead performer (he also gets good work from his male leads and a funny turn from Julie Walters as the Brooklyn boarding house owner where Ronan lives) and an eloquent script by Nick Hornby, based on Colm Toibin's (unread) novel."
BROOKLYN,24 December 2015,8/10,"Saiorse Ronan needs to be in more movies. She's an absolute delight, whatever she's in. Brooklyn is Ronan's finest 111 minutes to date. All the anguish, all the emotion she portrays, is seen through her eyes. Eilis (Ronan), is torn between two worlds: Ireland and America, missing her family back home and starting afresh halfway across the world in Brooklyn, New York. Events that occur only make it harder for Eilis. Emory Cohen's Tony sparks confidence in our out-of-sorts protagonist. Ronan's acting is so brazenly from the heart that I can't help but feel everything she feels, even during her hardest times. Special mention goes to Julie Walters who oversees the girls in the boarding house that Eilis resides. Brooklyn is an extraordinary watch due to class acting from all round. It's funny, clever and charming."
BROOKLYN,29 December 2016,8/10,"Brooklyn was nominated for three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actress (Saoirse Ronan) and Best Writing for an adapted Screen Play (Nick Hornb).This is a good movie which relates a fairly simple story about a young Irish girl, Eilis (Saoirse Ronan), who chooses to come to America (circa 1950). After traveling to America by boat, she gets a job in a department store while staying in a boarding house with other young Irish immigrant girls. During dinnertime, they all tell each other stories about how they view America; the stories are often funny and entertaining. Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters) is the head of the house that boards the Irish immigrant girls. Through writing to her sister in Ireland, Eilis keeps up with what is happening there while, at the same time, telling her sister about her life in Brooklyn. Eilis is courted by, and secretly marries, a nice Italian boy Tony (Emory Cohen) in Brooklyn just before she is forced to return to Ireland to attend a funeral. Her dilemma arises when her family in Ireland wants her to stay there rather than return to America. While the movie shows differences between Ireland and America, it presents both places positively while making the characters (in each country) interested in learning about the opposite country. Also, all the men from, both places, are truly nice guys with sincere motives. This, in itself, makes the movie refreshingly different to me."
BROOKLYN,13 May 2016,8/10,I will say Brooklyn was one of those movies that was touching from the beginning to end. Eilis is an Irish immigrant who is sponsored to Brooklyn for employment and better opportunities by a fellow priest knowing that she had a better future ahead. While the customs are a bit of a transition for eisley at first but she finds romance with an Italian named tony who makes her feel more comfortable in NY. There is amazing chemistry among the leads and beautiful scenery. What makes the film great is how anyone can start over and make a life for oneself. It is one of those tales that would continue to have a lasting impact. I know there have been many like eilis who have felt at odds over culture differences but it can amazing what new opportunities can be.
BROOKLYN,21 November 2015,8/10,"Brooklyn is probably the most accurate portrayal of the plight of an immigrant leaving there motherland, there country I have seen in a film. One is said to believe through many movies, books etc, that the reason people leave there motherland to come to America and Canada etc is because its the land of opportunity, that is true, but for the most part the sorrow one feels for leaving there own people, and the hardships one has to face while adjusting to a new country is what is always left out in popular culture. Its not all fun and games, and all happiness you see in most films for foreigners. Based in the 1950's Brooklyn is a coming of age romantic drama that highlights the issues mentioned above through a tale of a very endearing girl and how she matures into a women.Brooklyn brings that nostalgic feeling of the good ole days, of classic cinema of film made in the 50s-70s. Brooklyn is a heartwarming tale that is meant to make the viewers teary eyed, its a women centric film, and most of the time I am put off by such films, but Brooklyn is an exception. The 1950's setting looked very authentic, the costumes, the locations were authentic, but above all the story screenplay/story though bit of a old fashioned it was still highly engaging, and the film never dragged. Its a story that would work across any language, and one that everyone will be able to connect to, and thats why Brooklyn is a winner.Story wise an Irish immigrant in 1950s New York falls for a tough Italian plumber , but faces temptation from another man when she returns to her homeland for a visit.Acting wise Saoirse Ronan is completely breathtaking as Lacy, she was perfectly casted for the lead role. Watch out for the climax scene were she is telling the new girl how to behave in America.Emory Cohen played the typical Italian immigrant well. Jane Brennan is good as the mother.Fiona Glascott's characters sorrow comes out perfectly on the screen. Brid is extremely witty, and comical.Brooklyn for me did not have many blemishes, the film was a bit of too melodramatic at times, or a little too old fashioned but for a film set in the 1950s, these blemishes actually worked in favor of the story because the film is sort of a homage to the films of yore. Brooklyn successfully takes its viewers back to 1950's everything for the sets, clothing etc is perfect and fits the right time frame. The production values are flawless. The film at runtime of 1hr and 50 min succeeds in keeping the viewer fully engaged. Brooklyn's highlight is in the the way the film has been written, the emotions, of the film are beautifully portrayed. This is thanks to the lead actress and the story/screenplay. The story is just so heartwarming, and endearing that even the strongest viewer will shed a tear.Overall Brooklyn might not be a film that every audience demographic will enjoy its more of a female centric coming of the age romantic drama, that genre will keep a lot of viewers away. But the film is a fresh, and great film in my opinion, it was nice to watch a film thats so different then the usual clichéd weekly released flicks. I recommend that you should give Brooklyn a watch and I guarantee you will not be left disappointed,4/5* or 8/10"
BROOKLYN,8 November 2015,7/10,"Well, if you're ever feeling down, and you want a film that's both properly good and absolutely lovely, Brooklyn is the one to go for. With a wonderful romance story and a delightful central performance, there's so much to smile about here, whilst there's also still a lot of interesting drama to make this a thoroughly engaging watch.The plot revolves around Eilis, a young woman from a small Irish village, who is sent out to Brooklyn by her sister in the hope of finding a better life, and despite the hope it promises, she starts off extremely homesick and confused in this new world.However, this film manages to an expert job at blending the emotional drama of being homesick and leaving your own country forever with a hugely upbeat and positive atmosphere.A lot of that positivity comes down to Saoirse Ronan's fantastic performance as Eilis. She holds the dramatic side of the character very well, and shows off her conflicted feelings in some of the more emotional parts fantastically, but the most outstanding thing is how she makes Eilis such an infectiously adorable person.The way she speaks, her mannerisms and the dialogue that she's given by the writers all come together to make this central character someone that you really do like, and it's impossible to discredit how valuable that is when it comes to making an engaging story.This film isn't the fastest-paced or most action-packed, nor is it the heaviest on emotional and romantic drama, it is generally a pretty by-the-numbers fluffy period romance. And normally, that's the sort of stuff that you'd want to shy away from, but the acting and writing here come together to make such a captivating story about a woman finding herself and settling as an independent person in life. And achieving that, without being cheesy or preachy, is no mean feat.There are points in this film that don't quite pack the dramatic punch that you'd maybe like, and that could have yielded a potentially more compelling story, but there's still no denying that the balance that this film strikes between drama and pleasant, easy-going viewing is pretty much perfect."
BROOKLYN,20 February 2016,8/10,"It's a tremendous crime that Saoirse Ronan has been the bridesmaid of 2015's award season. Her achingly beautiful performance as Ailis Lacey is my favourite of 2015's nominations for Best Actress. When balancing quality of performance with the extent to which each lead actress had to carry her movie, I believe that Ronan comes out on top by far (Larson, Rampling and Blanchett being supported by their co-stars, and Lawrence's film being eh). As a quiet, Irish girl who moves to America in search of a better life, Ronan's performance is beautiful for its quiet dignity. Her shyness is reminiscent of Tahlia Shire's performance in Rocky forty years ago. I cannot compared her heartbreaking scenes of homesickness because they are purely Ronan's own work. The way she grips her letters from home as her eyes read and re-read every work from her loved ones is affecting.Her chemistry with Emory Cohen makes the movie utterly wonderful, with the shy grin that comes on his face almost inadvertently when he and Ronan share a moment. As an audience member you want them to show affection for each other, almost as if we might share in their love by being able to witness it. The most beautiful scene of the film is Ronan's big beautiful eyes searching for Cohen when he doesn't arrive as promised, and then the relief she and we feels when he finally arrives late. With two leads with such exceptional chemistry, I found Crowley's direction of their love to be a little starchy and not natural. I found Ronan's habit of putting her head on Cohen's shoulder (despite being slightly taller than him) very awkward to watch. Worse, Ronan and Cohen barely kiss for the entire movie and instead share long loving hugs. It is far beyond their sharing of ""I love you"" that we even see them kiss, and even huge emotional moments are simply marked by warm hugs. Ronan's chemistry with Domnhall Gleeson (who does a great job despite it) isn't nearly as good as her chemistry with Emory Cohen and so even though their physical affection is less awkward we never fully believe in Farrell as a romantic rival for Cohen. Nick Hornby writes a lovely script for Brooklyn, and is to be credited with the film's beautiful themes. We watch helplessly as Ailis is sucked back into her life in Ireland by a series of well- intentioned events that are positive but still keep her away. The film's bookend scene on the boat are similar enough that we can see how much Ailis has grown without Hornby wanting to recycle the dialogue word for word. Nothing in Brooklyn is shoved down our throat, and much of the dialogue is snappy and memorable.The cast of Brooklyn is delightful, especially all the Irish girls Ailis meets both on the way and in Brooklyn. Julie Walters is delightfully sassy as Mrs. Keogh and Jim Broadbent is gentle and dignified as the priest in charge of getting Ailis to New York in the first place. The production design of the film is wonderful, feeling much like a trip through time, and the costumes are a beautiful splash of colour in a stoic pallet that is the film's backdrop. The cinematography is efficient, especially when the camera drifts off to one side as Ailis' boat drifts out of the port.Brooklyn is a beautiful, heartwarming movie that one can watch with a smile on their face. Girls will fall in love with Emory Cohen, men should cherish Saoirse Ronan, and everyone should come away with something they've enjoyed."
BROOKLYN,13 February 2016,7/10,"The film is charming in its portrayal, however, I find that the story too strongly promotes the American dream. First off, Eilis is only able to move to America through the help of the Priest (Hugh Gormley) who so kindly pays for everything. This story does not portray an Irish immigrant's move to America, it portrays an Irish immigrant with the means to move to America. What I mean by this is that she is about middle class, and everything is done for her which paints her life in America as much better than her life back home. The only struggle she faces is learning how to connect with others, and even that skill is acquired soon enough. So I am just pointing out that we should be aware that this is not a typical immigrant story, but one in which promotes the American dream ideology. The American dream being that everyone regardless of background (race, class, gender, sexuality) is able to rise to the top through hard work and persistence. This is obviously not the case, as the people who have more opportunities (Eilis) are more likely to be the successful ones. Eilis works hard, is polite and responsible, adapts to the culture, falls in love and can soon call herself an American. Also, I would have imagined that the Americans would give her a hard time especially because of her accent, but that did not happen. Everyone was very nice to her and gave her whatever she needed. Therefore, the unrealistic probability of this happening in real life emphasizes the presence of the American dream so much that it just envelops the whole story. Perhaps it's because I have been learning how to spot ideologies in my film classes that I find this one particularly poignant. Anyway, the actresses and actors did a great job with their characters. The settings definitely helped to bring back the nostalgia of the 1950's. Ronan is quite the rising star, and she delivers an engaging performance full of emotion. Her Irish accent is pretty good- though I am not Irish so can't really judge its authenticity. Cohen and Gleeson play their parts well and fit nicely into the image of their characters. Rickards (have to mention her, just love her on Arrow!) and Macklin have good on screen chemistry and their mean girls act is entertaining to watch. Also, the dialogues between the characters are well crafted and made to show the connections between each one. I like the low key flirtations between Eilis and Tony; as well as the banter between Eilis and her friends. The conversations also bring out the characters' personalities and gives us more of a sense of who they are. Overall a charming film with great acting and settings, but too much promotion of the American dream."
BROOKLYN,8 April 2017,8/10,"A charming story, with an admirable cast and lovable characters. Brooklyn narrates a very grounded, and even better; relatable, story in a very appealing and likable way.This movie is about family, home, loss, choice and of course, love, and it melds it all together so well. Saoirse Ronan is incredibly captivating and never drops the ball once. She is an absolute joy to watch, and this role was tailor made for her, and she executed it with class.Ermory Cohan, though he too was very impressive, I feel was just a little bit miscast. Ermory has a look about him that screams ""bad guy"", that had me concerned for the most part, that he would turn into an abusive dolt. If the character was meant to seem that way for the plot, he would've been perfect, but Tony is innocent and ""sweet"", and Ermory threw me off from time to time.From there, the character dynamics were a pleasure. Eilis and Rose, Mary and Rose, Eilis and Mary. Eilis and her boarding house mates. Eilis and her best friend, Eilis and Jim, Eilis and the witch and of course, Eilis and Tony.Brooklyn is a definite must watch. Its simplicity is quite simply, delightful. A firm 8/10."
BROOKLYN,17 April 2016,9/10,"Brilliantly conceived, acted and photographed it freely uses artistic license to document the historical phenomenon of young ladies from Enniscortie in Wexford, Ireland sponsored by parish priests in Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn in New York City to relocate in the 1950s to jobs and boarding house residences to Brooklyn traveling steerage by boat to a strange land where they in fact know no one. In this historic time period, often considered the golden age of western culture and civilization times start out hard in both Ireland and in New York City but soon historically pick up on both sides of the Atlantic. Young ladies who at first believed emigration from Ireland to New York City was their best lifestyle option often soon started rethinking whether returning home to Ireland isn't suddenly better. Alice (Eilis in Gaelic) Lacey lives in Enniscortie with her widowed mother and her spinster sister, Rose who earns the income supporting this little family. With no hope of a proper job or a proper marriage in Enniscortie Eilis accepts an offer from a parish priest in Brooklyn she has never met to travel steerage by boat to New York City where she will live in a boarding house in Brooklyn Heights run by Julie Walters to work as a salesgirl in an upscale department store in downtown Brooklyn. Things seem at first unexpected to Eilis doom and gloom on the boat, in her boarding house and on her job as well as among her parish's Irish male widowers who once built the bridges and tunnels but now depend for charity on the same Irish priests who sponsored her This aspect of the film seems hauntingly realistic as are the dialogue and the visual setting. With things historically now improving in the golden age of New York and of the British Isles Eilis soon has a proper job promotion opportunity, a proper marriage opportunity and a grander social life opportunity simultaneously in Brooklyn and in Enniscortie for the fictitious Eilis Lacey.. Emery Cohen proposes to her in Brooklyn as Tony Fiorello and Domhall Gleeson in Enniscortie as Jim Farrell. In life most of us just starting out in this time period had similar opportunities both at home and away from home to possibly make sensible lifestyle choices. Eilis in this brilliant film seems taken aback by the dual possibilities once a plot twist places her in the same fortuitous position in both Brooklyn and Enniscortie. Her struggle to make what she thinks is the opportune choice in the final moments of the drama seem a heavy burden to her fictitious character but in fact in my time was what most of us went through when choosing among realistically better opportunities at home and far away. Brilliant, compelling, well photographed edited and acted a real gem of a film."
BROOKLYN,22 December 2015,9/10,"Saorise Ronan's understated performance in Brooklyn is so good if its doesn't get an Oscar nomination, the Academy's credibility will be diminished to that of a GOP presidential candidate.Nick Hornby has done it again with a superb screenplay about a young Irish woman's adventure as an immigrant in New York, finding love and having that love tested. Ronan carries the film from Ireland to America, to Ireland and back to America. She is ably assisted by love interest Emory Cohen.Brooklyn is a touching and honest film set in the 1950s New York and Ireland whose principals could be any of the many nationalities that have emigrated to America . It features an ensemble cast including Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent."
BROOKLYN,22 February 2016,1/10,"Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis, a young Irish girl exchanging her hometown in Ireland for Brooklyn New York. After the long voyage she finds employment and a husband. When her sister back in Ireland dies, she is forced to go back home and has to deal with the lure of both homes.Brooklyn is a well made movie with superb acting. The story however is surprisingly thin, predictable and too slow paced towards the end to hold one's attention. There's simply not enough conflict and the characters are not fleshed out to any satisfying degree, rendering them little more than stereotypes. 6/10"
BROOKLYN,12 April 2016,,"Audience applause at the end of the showing I attended of ""Brooklyn"" is something I can hardly ever remember from a cinema visit. Obviously a symptom of universal pleasure, it got me thinking about how and why this particular film. For me it had to do with nostalgia. Although I was probably the oldest member of the audience I daresay there could have been quite a few not so far behind. Were they perhaps thinking, as I was, that most of today's cinema just doesn't generate the emotional warmth that we so often basked in during the heydays of the '30's through to the '50's? That here for once was a work that succeeded in capturing just that. It so rarely happens. John Schlesinger's ""Yanks"" did it for me in 1979 when he memorably evoked the emotional effect that the departure of so many American soldiers had on a British community at the end of the war with all the intensity of a previous generation of directors. I thought of ""Yanks"" when I came away from ""Brooklyn"". Although the new film is much smaller in scale it has that same affection for characters that was the hallmark of the best of yesteryear. I had imagined that a film chronicling a young Irish girl's experiences of travelling alone to a new life in the States would be more astringent. Although it does not shirk social issues such as a beautifully observed Christmas lunch for elderly Irishmen who have fallen on hard times, it has a warmth and honesty that never verges on the sentimental. We care for Eilis, happy when she finds love with the good natured Tony, worry when her return to Ireland presents her with a nice but obvious second best and rejoice when all comes right at the end. A lovely film, lovingly directed by a newcomer to me, John Crowley."
BROOKLYN,16 May 2019,7/10,"This is pretty classic Hollywood fare; A love story with the possibility of that love being broken by an intruder. Thomas Hardy could have written it himself ( but he didn't)
Quality acting of this type doesn't come along too often these days and the cast does a really good job of pulling your heartstrings.
It's so nice to see wholesome people on the screen again,
(especially Italian/American guys) and it shows you how much we've been battered over the head with bad guys, that you're on the edge of your seat waiting to find out when things go wrong.It is, above all, a sweet and redemptive movie and it's not at all about Brooklyn
(the title was one of the reasons I watched it, because I recently spent a couple of miserable months there).
There's not much Brooklyn actually in the scenes (thank goodness), it's more a story of the frailty of love when distance is involved.A very pleasant production and if you're in any way inclined to shed a tear over lost love then this will be for you .. sniffle sniffle."
BROOKLYN,17 May 2016,6/10,"Listen, all of us have our own movie taste and it's not likely to change because of some reviews or IMDb quotes. Brooklyn is not a movie I liked. Plain and simple. I can say I tolerated it and I admit that it is well directed, carefully crafted and an overall good production. While I am aware of the fact that the movie is quality, I can also say that the movie bored at times and had no tension to make you want to see it through. Honestly, there's no drama or anything too exciting happening until the last 15 minutes. I am not sure how to categorize this movie. It's not a comedy. It fails to be a romantic comedy to me. It's probably just a love story with not much of a substance. There's nothing you can openly criticize, there's nothing you can openly love. Watch it if you want. If you don't your day will be the same."
BROOKLYN,28 November 2015,10/10,"Do not hold the fact that director John Crowley also directed two episodes of True Detective (2015), because his work here, along with the romantic writing by Nick Hornby (""About a Boy"" - 2002), beautiful cinematography by Yves Belanger ((""WILD"" 2014) and period costumes by Odile Dicks-Mireauz (""An Education"" 2009) should not be missed. Based on the novel by Colm Toibin, Saoirse Ronan (""The Lovely Bones"" - 2009) is shy Ellis, an Irish flower pushed into the new world by her sister Rose (Fiona Glascott), as were many an Irish Immigrant in the 1950's. Joining her along her journey is cutie pie Tony (Emory Cohen ""SMASH"" -TV) - in a breakout role, who melts hers and your heart with his every smile. Guiding her on her New York experience is her sponsoring Priest (the excellently reserved Jim Broadbent ""Moulin Rouge"" - 2001), and her boarding house guardian Mrs. Kehoe (the amazing Julie Walters ""Educating Rita"" 1983). The entire ensemble is perfectly cast by Fiona Weir, making this movie experience (from start to finish) a must see. ""Brooklyn"" has Academy Award recognition written all over it."
BROOKLYN,14 December 2015,9/10,"This film is about a young woman in the 1950's named Eilis who moves from Ireland to New York (Brooklyn specifically), in search of a better life. At first she is very home sick, but as time goes by gets to know a few people and starts making a very good life for herself. She then meets a young a man called Tony who she falls immediately for and they have a great time together. Then a family tragedy happens and it takes her back to Ireland. She then has to choose does she want this new life in Brooklyn or want to go back to her roots with her family. The film is beautifully shot and you get a real feeling of the era. Saoirse Ronan is amazing in this role. You can really feel her homesickness at the beginning. As she grows to love Brooklyn her confidence is sky high. She shows emotional depth in this role and I think deserves her Oscar nomination. There are also some funny moments with her land lady played by the great Julie Walters. I loved the era this was set in and the costumes. The music was some very beautiful Irish music. This is one of the best films of the year. I highly recommend this film"
BROOKLYN,24 August 2019,,"Ronan's character gets everything handed to her with no effort and really no appreciation, as if it's all just her due, and the one decision she has to make isn't all that hard since, as usual, it's already made for her by other characters, so I am not sure what the point of this film was.I believe the enthusiastic reviews are from people who projected their own feelings and fantasies onto Ronan's character, because she was basically a cipher in a very basic story."
BROOKLYN,22 January 2016,8/10,"Next up on my round of 2016 Best Picture nominees: ""Brooklyn"".This movie tells the story of a young Irish immigrant who moves to Brooklyn circa 1920, only to find her life torn between relationships in her new home and transatlantic loved ones. This is the latest feature film produced by the BBC to score a Best Picture nod from the Academy, following in the footsteps of ""The King's Speech"" and ""An Education"", etc.As can be expected from a film receiving such accolades, this movie is very well done and tells its story well. The script, pacing, and acting all are top notch in this movie. Its PG-13 rating also makes for a great date movie for all ages--teens through seniors will find much to like about this very clean cut movie. It's a romance and drama all rolled into one, and it all comes together nicely into an enjoyable movie going experience.That said, I've given this movie 8/10 stars simply because it falls just short of the extraordinary category that a 9 or a 10 would be reserved for. This is a very well made and very enjoyable movie--and indeed one that may prove re-watchable and memorable. But, in my view, it falls just short of greatness. It's a very good ""good movie"", but not one that is a must see. Thus my eight stars."
BROOKLYN,29 August 2020,6/10,"Saoirse Ronan's performance was fabulous and the cast was good overall. I really liked the first part of the movie, the conflict was simple(immigrating and adapting to USA) but well executed. The second part was really mixed. In the 2nd part you realize that the conflict hasn't appeared yet which completely changes the first part of the movie. You could even say that the first part had its own climax at the end, but because of how the 2nd part progresses; the 1st part becomes just a setup. The 1st part just sets up the character, which might sound okay but because of that the later part of the movie feels rushed. The side characters in the first part are totally different with the ones in 2nd part which results in the movie setting up different characters, and the climax arrives at the end and resolves rather quickly like it is in a hurry. Domhnall Gleeson's character is the same as Tony so it doesn't add anything to the story. Eilis is an interesting character but I can't say the same for other characters. They are all superficial and not developed at all. Still a good movie, could have been great with a few minor changes."
BROOKLYN,15 January 2016,10/10,"Brooklyn is a 2015 historical period drama film that is directed by John Crowley and based on the novel with the same name by Colm Tóibín. This movie is about an Irish immigrant set in the 1950s,who falls for a Italian plumber but then she faces problems in doing the same thing for another man when she goes back home for a ""short"" visit. This movie is beyond amazing,with well written characters and great performances especially by the lead Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey,who in my opinion gives by far the best performance of the year (only real competition being Brie Larson from Room).She is truly memorable and very much deserving of every award she received so far and hopefully will continue to receive more.Emory Cohen is also very good as Tony (Eilis's Italian lover).I hope that this is the role that gets him recognized and gets him more work because he so deserves it.Domhnall Gleeson has had an amazing year with Ex Machina,Star Wars:TFA and now this,where he plays as Jim Farrell,Emilis's second lover from her hometown.This guy can do no wrong and I'm pretty sure that he slowly is winning over everyone's heart. The director (John Crowley) does a wonderful job and he deserved a nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards but was snubbed badly.He brings these characters to life with wonderful directing and excellent scenery with interesting and sometimes ironic scenes between the two different love lives of Eilis. The score is fantastic,it is sad when it needs to and wonderfully emotional for some of the more romantic scenes,the cinematography and editing are also mesmerizing and the movie is in just the right running time as it needs to be. I loved this movie and I would recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it yet because more and more people need to see this amazing piece of work in the big screens."
BROOKLYN,25 March 2020,9/10,"Brooklyn is a wonderful movie that captures how it felt like to live in the Brooklyn many years back. It tells the story of love and adapting life after immigrating to America. It's emotional, it's laughable, it's makes you feel so great and happy. It feels very nostalgic in a very good way and I throughly felt true joy from it."
BROOKLYN,2 February 2016,5/10,"I admit I had a bad attitude going into Brooklyn, considering I don't like historical romance dramas, and Brooklyn is precisely that. The story is surely old hat, with the nuance that Ellis (Saorise Ronan) is a strong female lead trying to find her way in a male-dominated world.Brooklyn is a nice movie for nice people. It's an adventure into the unknown, as well as a yearning for the familiar. The experience of falling in love and feeling doubt all plays well, and we are tactfully reminded that it's difficult for women to support themselves in the 1950s and beyond, so the pressure to find a man with solid bonafides can be suffocating. Let those heteronormative balloons fly!Were the filmmakers being clever enough to draw connections to the current Syrian refugee crisis? I don't think so. This seems to be a straightforward love story in a world built on commodities and appearances. Ellis is a good person because she is able to offer compassion and kindness to others, even when she needs to be cared for herself.Unfortunately, everyone is a colossal bore, except for Mrs. Keogh (Julie Walters) and Ellis's department store boss, Miss Fortini (Jessica Paré). There's no real drama, short of a bout of seasickness, and we learn an important life lesson: don't always grab what's better just because you can. And the world is a spectacle filled with facades of insincerity. If you can find true love, you better sell out.It's nice to see the Catholic church doing something good after watching the devastation of Spotlight."
BROOKLYN,21 June 2019,10/10,"I loved this movie very, very much! A heartfelt movie that moved me. A wonderful cast of actors. They played their part beautifully and naturally. There were some scenes that made me cry. It's a wonderful movie. That's all I have to say."
BROOKLYN,4 October 2018,7/10,I loved it. The actors were great and the story was so good
BROOKLYN,3 November 2015,9/10,"Brooklyn is one of those rare films that's written, acted and directed with such elegance, it never gets boring or disengaging and could really be about anything. What I appreciated most were how some of the more darker, difficult levels of the film are sublimated into more easy-going scenes and distractions. The more superficial of watchers probably won't even appreciate its depths, but don't be fooled, there are some weighty implications if you empathise with the characters. I found myself stewing over all sorts of conflicts, decisions, values, memories - and depending on where you're at in your life (and your own personal experiences), you might do similar. I could completely relate to various elements, and found the film more useful as a stimulant for useful rumination than any friends could offer. In this regard, Brooklyn really is a great work of art. One of the toughest messages within the film is the idea that the pursuit of happiness and belonging can only be laden with extreme loss too. Of the past, of people, of options, of youth. I found the handling of this duality refreshing, because films rarely seem to explore the dovetailing of growth/progress with loss in any meaningful way."
BROOKLYN,8 February 2017,8/10,"I like this adapting movie , even-though i'm not into romantic movies nor classic , but i find this really enjoyable film because of its magnificent dramatic scenes , but i'm still wondering! why John Crowley didn't get nominated for this movie , in my humble opinion , i don't see that Nick Hornby has done any worthy of note changes, ""i mean from the novel"" that makes him worth an Oscar . and when it comes to the performance judging i say that i admire the marvelous acting of Saoirse Ronan in this movie , and i think she deserves an Oscar for it too , but i believe that Fiona Glascott ""Rose"" is better at sad moment scenes than her , and i hope she get opportunities for more leading role ,and about ""Emory Cohen"" i reckon he doesn't fit in romantic roles but i guess he can do action/drama adroitly , i don't want to forget that boy , Tony's brother the gossipy child , he's cool and i hope he gets attention in the future. also in terms of the movie shooting i noticed there once in of the begging scenes , they kept the camera still , toward ""Eilis"" face more than they should have , i mean obviously it was superfluous . the morals and lessons learned from this movie are :- 1-moving on and traveling can change a lot of one's habits , and many things in your personality , but not necessary everything , like ""Saoirse"" there's one trait in her character that didn't change which is amenability, i mean being amenable . 2-the world is small place and you can't hide a secret for too long . 3-as life goes on we will discover that our life isn't our choice . the third point elucidate the summary title i put for this movie . the earnings of this movie was satisfying . finally i still have two questions twirling in my head , the first is why she kept procrastinate reading tony's letters ? is it because she don't want to remember him or to miss him , or she just doesn't love him anymore ! the second one is was she going to go back to Brooklyn even if ""miss Kelly"" haven't told her that she knows about her marriage story ? Those question make the movie join to a third genre besides Drama which is Mystery . Thank you for reading this ."
BROOKLYN,19 February 2016,10/10,"This is an odd case, in my opinion. It's a simple story--a romantic drama to be exact--and it's nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. It's not the type of film you'd think would be nominated in this category. It's great, sure, but the Academy usually recognizes either groundbreaking films or controversial films--nowadays at least. This one is neither. But that should just show you how strong of a film it is. Much like 2009's An Education, Brooklyn is very low concept. It's not controversial, it's not political, it's not even all that original. But it hits its audience in a sensitive place with its charm about a topic that we can all relate to--love.Brooklyn, starring Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen, follows an Irish immigrant, Eilis (Ronan), as she comes to the United States seeking new opportunity. We see pretty early on that she is a selfless person--always doing community service and being involved in her church. Although she comes from a privileged background, Eilis doesn't look down on anyone. But she's very shy and doesn't know how to talk to new people. Men flirt with her, but she just turns the other way. That is, until, she meets Tony (Cohen), an uneducated Italian-American plumber, who develops an immediate attraction to her. This is where the film really gets going, though it comes in a little later than we'd like. However, we don't terribly mind since we love getting the ""immigrant trying to make it in America"" portion of the story as well. It helps to round out the film. The filmmakers know that they can't just make a 2 hour love story without bordering on vanity, so they don't try to fool us and do it anyway. Tony has a simple outlook on life. He's a dreamer, but lacks confidence. Even before he really knows why, he loves Eilis whole-heartedly. They bring the best out of each other. But what makes their relationship so real is how they better one another when they're apart. Although arguably less shy than Tony, Eilis now handles herself with more confidence and starts getting along with others even better.I'm not sure I've seen on-screen chemistry like I have in this film. Ronan and Cohen are immaculate together. And that's a true attribution to their performances. The two of them have so much depth both together and apart. Cohen is convincing in showing us the non- stereotypical vulnerability of Tony. And with the help of Ronan's outstanding performance, you can see what's going on in Eilis' mind without her saying too much. It's her decisions that give her the most depth.Brooklyn is relatable on so many levels. It's also about leaving home and that transition to recognizing home as somewhere new.The city of Brooklyn is nice to look at in its own right in the early 1950s, but Ireland is even prettier. Luckily, the filmmakers recognize this and take us back there one last time. You don't often see people fawning over a film that simply romanticize love, but it's the earnestness and simplicity of Brooklyn that tugs at our strings the most. Without ever feeling contrived, it restores confidence in something that we may often take for granted in this day and age.Twizard Rating: 99"
BROOKLYN,1 September 2020,9/10,"A wonderful little movie about a young Irish woman who immigrates to America and deals with the emotional turmoil of leaving her old life behind. The film explores the themes of isolation, familiarity and what we consider home. Firstly, the movie has an incredibly warm, inviting and down to earth atmosphere, delivering a heartwarming tale about our strong attachments to home, and the conflicting obligations that may pull us towards two different countries. This was largely helped by Saiorse Ronan's incredible performance, portraying the plain yet humble Eilis. She perfectly captures the essence of her warm and familiar character, as we can all see a part of us inside her. When Eilis arrives in America, she first struggles to adjust and is bewildered by the unfamiliar city and faces, perfectly conveying the grief and emptiness that comes along with feeling homesick. However, Eilis slowly begins forming new connections and relationships, consequently creating a new life for herself and realising that Brooklyn is beginning to feel like home. It's for this reason that the movie wins us over, as it resonates with so many of us who have been in the same situation, and perfectly portrays the different stages we encounter as we create a new life for ourselves. I love how the film conveys to us how easily a once strange and unfamiliar place can become something so significant because of the people we find there. Eilis character development was subtle yet powerful, as we see her become a stronger, more confident woman who is not so afraid of change anymore. This was well portrayed through the cinematography, which later on presented everything around Eilis in a bigger, bolder light, thus conveying she had adopted a more diverse view of the world, no longer being confined to the familiarity of Ireland. I really loved when Eilis went home for her sisters funeral, and upon returning, realised what she had missed and all of the opportunities that had arisen from her old life, leaving her conflicted and having to choose between the two places. The side characters were fabulous, especially Tony who was incredibly likeable and romantic, and Domhnall Gleeson, who breaks our hearts with his love for Eilis, and his complete lack of knowledge that she was married, ultimately being let down in the end. This moral dilemma was necessary in making Eilis finally realise that Ireland is no longer her home, and that she can't just cling onto someone because of their familiarity. We sympathise with Eilis rather than despising her, as we relate to her feelings of wanting to be close to those who are from our own country or background, and it's how we feel attached to home. However, the movie teaches wholeheartedly to move forward, to not be afraid of new opportunities in our lives, and that home can be anywhere you want it to be. Overall, a delightful and heartwarming tale focused on the universal theme of leaving home, and the problems that arise with it. The storytelling was simple yet powerful, and ultimately created a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!"
BROOKLYN,20 August 2016,10/10,"It is rare that a film fills a hole I didn't know existed.Brooklyn is a period romance about a woman, Ellis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), who immigrates from Ireland to the United States in the 1950's. It is also one of the best films of what turned out to be a fantastic year for cinema.When I think of immigration from Ireland, I think of the 1840's and 1850's, during the Great Potato Famine, or else I think of the turn of the century, the high point for immigration of all sorts. But the eras that have been passed over by popular culture are not empty shells. They have stories to tell. This film is one of the very best of these stories.Above all, it is a lovely film. It is not bold or brash or glitzy or any other quintessentially American attribute, but it is a quintessentially American film. I do not mean it is the sort of film that could only be made in America by Americans, but rather that it is the sort of the film that exemplifies what my country is, at its best, about: growth, opportunity, resilience, desire.Nevertheless, it is far too complex and beautiful of a film to be adequately summed up by a few buzz words. The filmmaking craft is top-notch. There are shots in this film that are framed like paintings, such as the first shot of the film- Ellis' home and street- and the first shot of New York City, with the Empire State Building glimmering in the distance.The character work is even better. I hate most movie romances because they feel contrived and tacked on. At no point do they feel necessary or important. This is a shame, because a great romance evokes passions, dreams, fears, and wishes that nothing else can. Great romance can be big and boisterous or soft and subtle, but it has to be intimate and potent, a secret shared between the two lovers. By those measures, this is one of the best romances in the history of art, and I do not say this likely.There is a love triangle, but it is natural, gripping, and very non-petty. Ellis behaves in a reasonable way, her actions filled with her personality and her evolving mental state. A bad love triangle plays out like The Bachelor. A great love triangle plays out like a boat navigating two shores. Ellis is not just caught between two guys. She is caught between two different lives, two different ideals, two different dreams.The best films all feel unique, like it could only be made at one place and one time but one team. While this film is in many ways a throwback to an earlier era, offering a feel, an environment, and a story that had been left behind by the passage of time, it is its own production. It shows the past as it could only be viewed from not just a present, but this present, by these people.It is not obvious or obtuse, but gentle and subtle, a welcome change in the era of towering blockbusters meant to be seen exactly one time by tens of millions of people. Most films nowadays are like a roller-coaster- you get on, get twisted around for a while, get off, eat, and move on. This film feels like love, how appropriate, considering it is a romance. You're immediately drawn in. You want to know more, to dive deeper. Eventually, you fall in head first and are overjoyed about it. When it ends, you are crestfallen, but you know the memories you have formed will stay with you until eternity.Saorise Ronan stands out among a collection of talented actors and actresses delivering some of the best performances of their lives. I want to see more of her. I want her to make more roles come alive. She has the right blend of fierce and sensitive. Though she (wrongfully) did not get an Oscar for her role, I have no doubt she will receive one in the future. I do, however, doubt that she will be as good as she is here. This role fits her perfectly.As a film critic, I am often disappointed when writing my reviews. I want to share with you, my audience, the feeling a film gave me. But that is impossible. A film, despite only normally being between an hour and a half and three hours, is a combination of the work of hundreds or even thousands of people over often years. The best a critic can do is try to capture the essence of that feeling, but even that is hard to do. Art is about emotions, and while emotions can be explained, they cannot be translated. I could talk to you about what happiness feels like, but I can't make you feel happy by doing that."
BROOKLYN,25 January 2016,9/10,"Not in the mood for the stunning violence of The Revenant or the bitter racism of The Hateful Eight? Nor the angst of Carol or The Danish Girl? Nor the special effects weaponry of Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Here's a nice, sweet historical movie about first love, the pains and rewards of immigration, and the choices we make. Brooklyn, as directed by John Crowley, with a script by Academy Award nominee Nick Hornby (based on Colm Tóibín's book of the same name), reminds us that leaving home is a lonely choice, even when it's the best choice a person has. (And so much harder before email, skype, and budget air fares.) When clear-eyed Eilis Lacey (played by Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan) leaves Ireland to come to America in the early 1950s, she has no confidence that she'll ever see Ireland again. In a bit of cross-cultural serendipity, she meets Italian plumber Tony (Emory Cohen), and each is charmed with the other and the cultures they come from. Watching her try to learn to eat spaghetti under the tutelage of her bantering roommates is splashily funny. But when tragedy at home calls Eilis back to Ireland, she does go, despite the length, cost, and difficulty of the journey. Once home, the inducements to stay mount. Brooklyn—which was also an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture—has moments with ""a resonance that extends far beyond its immediate circumstances,"" says Glenn Kenny for Rogerebert.com. It's a beautiful, big-hearted movie that will leave you smiling, Irish eyes or no."
BROOKLYN,28 November 2015,9/10,"In a world where the romantic film seems like such a hard thing to get right, Brooklyn is a great example that it can be done. The romantic film today has become a clichéd mess, much like the horror genre, so much so that when one comes along that is genuinely great it's worth pointing out. Brooklyn is well acted, often funny, and boasts a great story. This film may be best remembered in future years as being Saoirse Ronan's breakout role as a leading actress.Lead and anchored by Ronan's performance, the film fell on her shoulders and she carried the weight gracefully. Ronan's performance helped make her character, Eilis, feel like a real person, who is scared and alone. As well as making her character feel real, Ronan also had great chemistry with her co-star, and love interest Emory Cohen. Their chemistry shines most though when the characters play off of each other.The way the two characters play off each other helps give the film a really good sense of humor. Especially the scene when Ronan meets Cohen's family. All of this aside the plot may be the best part of the film. We as humans need conflict, and recently romantic films have struggled capturing a realistic sense of conflict. Most recent romantic films try to manufacture conflict through an estranged person, getting in the way of the main character, what this film does well is that it makes life get in the way of the main character.By this I mean that the conflict in this movie is derived from situations all people either have found themselves in, or can relate to making it more realistic. This approach combined with Ronan's very visual acting style helps sell the conflict, and thus make the film all the more entertaining. Really what Brooklyn does so well is it strips down the romantic genre to a group of core elements and then built a story around it, making the film's conflict more natural.By giving the film a simple, yet deep story with a natural conflict that most audience members can relate to Brooklyn succeeds as an original romance film. Lead by the brilliant acting of Saoirse Ronan the film is able to create realistic characters, and eve generate a few laughs. Brooklyn does a great job combining great acting, with realistic characters, in a natural story, that is funny but not sappy, to make a great overall film."
BROOKLYN,4 March 2016,9/10,"I would like to identify this one as gentle feminist since the leading female character struggled to own her true feelings through out different stages and circumstances of her young life which might be most likely resonated with audience.It's a delicately crafted and well thought out story which avoided those usual plots i.e. murders, sexual crimes or even various deceiving acts to be employed into and ended of ruining it. However, even with such a strong foundation it would not be a good film without right actors and actress to interpret the roles. The actors and actresses did wonderful jobs to carry the story. No wonder, it took several years in the making. I am glad that they were willing to take such a long process instead.It's gentle and moving but delivering riveting emotions. It's well worth of spending time on."
BROOKLYN,19 November 2015,9/10,"Wow, Just wow. What a film. I was most impressed by the performances by all involved especially Saoirse Ronan's who played Eilis. She has been tipped for Oscar 2016. Such powerful performances. Great well done. My number one pet peeve other than Music, which am delighted was wonderful and fantastic, BUT the plot, which I will outline in a mo. I was most impressed with the way they portrayed the 1950s. Highly recommended. When in particular the way they used to use the Boat from Cobh, Co. Cork. The film is set in Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford. So Eilis prob got the train over to Cobh or something. But the number one thing that got to me was the emotions. She showed true character as per Colm Tobin's novel. THe plot as I said above was most appreciative very simple. Eilis is currently living with her Mother and Rose(Glascott). She gets a hankering to move to Brooklyn, New York City whom she was helped by Fr. Flood(Broadbent) in terms of a Visa AND a Job. She got a job as a sales person in Balloci a jewellery or something. Says I to meself, my god you could just literally sale into a job, but these days, totally different. So she meets a sexy young Italian buck Tony(Cohen). It is with great sadness, of which I won't bother getting into it, forces Eilis to return back to Ireland. So while back, her friend or neighbor Nancy(O' Higgins) sets her up with a guy, with a very cute mmmmm guy Jim Farrell(Gleeson). Before Eilish returns to IReland, TOny marries Eilis so that EIlis ""promises"" to return back to him. Whilst in Ireland, she gets feelings for Ireland again AND my precious Jim. So M Kelly(Brennan) being the villain I take it, makes up her mind for EVERYTHING by revealing ""how small this world is"", when she reveals that a ""young girl from Enniscorthy"", married TOny an ""Italian"". So on that note, I will leave you all to guess the rest. ahahah."
BROOKLYN,22 November 2019,7/10,"Many people enjoy a good period piece with great actors and a good overall story. Brooklyn did extremely well at the BO for an indie. I will see anything with Saorise Ronan ever since Hanna, but the ending left me cold. It could have been easily remedied but perhaps the writer was tapping into a true story and could not veer from the facts, even though based on a novel.No critic I read had anything but praise for Brooklyn and I enjoyed it enough to see it in the theater twice, but it does have a serious problem. Ellis played by Ronan is the feminist heroine daring to be different and go against her mother's wishes and local customs by moving to America. She wants to have a better life and America is the land of opportunity. She falls in love with a boy she meets at a dance in Brooklyn. The boy urges her to marry him before she goes back to Ireland to attend a funeral. He does not want to risk losing her. She does not want to rush into the marriage but does so anyway. They marry secretly.In Ireland she gets a part time job bookkeeping (a skill she was trained for in the USA) and very much enjoys it. Her work is appreciated and Ireland is looking much better to her. A wealthy, good-looking man takes her out to dinner and then falls in love with her. She falls in love with him. She never tells anyone she is married but leads the man to believe she is considering marriage and a new home with him. She is apparently planning on becoming a bigamist when someone finds out she is already married. We get a speech from her about small-minded people in small towns and how nothing has really changed there. She decides to go back to Brooklyn and stay with husband number one. Ellis does not really have a choice, does she? She recognizes that she will be utterly rejected by everyone when they find out. The director uses several tricks to keep us from thinking about this problem, such as her letter of explanation we are never allowed to read.She is not a heroine because she was never honest. There was nothing wrong with the locals thinking she was a schemer and a shrew for never telling anyone the truth about her marriage and lack of availability. We are spared by the director from seeing the damage done to her new, prospective husband who was very much in love with her. So, it is a bittersweet tale.I accepted the story line at first because she was young and naive but that flies in the face of praising her as a ground-breaking and brave feminist."
BROOKLYN,22 January 2017,10/10,"The film was heartwarming and deservedly received Oscar nominations for Best Picture and for Best Actress for Saoirse Ronan. It showed the narrow-minded and dead-end society that Eilis faced in her native Ireland in the early 1950s and how she was able to expand her horizons in America. On a visit back to Ireland she is tempted to remain by visions of a better future there but then realizes that things haven't really changed that much and her future is still in America, where she returns to the husband that she had married for love but seemed to forget while back in Ireland. That said, the movie was somewhat disappointing for several reasons: while probably historically accurate, it seems a shame that a young woman would go from an Irish homeland to a similarly insulated Irish immigrant community in Brooklyn. When she meets her husband-to-be at a dance he is probably the first Italian-American she has ever met. When she is invited to dinner at his home, the more-worldly girls in her all-Irish boarding house have to teach her how to eat spaghetti, a dish she has never tried. This gradual breakout from an insular community to a multi-ethnic society was probably accurate for the early 1950s. It reminded me of an autobiography by a journalist who had gone to work for Fortune magazine at that time. He pointed out that the staff had, besides WASPs, some Catholics and even Jews, which they considered to be highly ethnically diverse at the time. And no doubt the children of Eilis, a bookkeeper, and Tony, a plumber, would go to college and become teachers, lawyers, and journalists, and be friends with Asians, African-Americans, and Latinos. And their grandchildren would probably convert to other faiths and even marry outside their traditional family. Secondly, the romance between Eilis and Tony is probably accurate for many couples, especially during wartime or when confronted with new and different types of people. But one wishes they had shared more of their interests and concerns, to see how compatible they would be later in life, rather than just go on the fact that Tony is a ""nice guy"" and Eilis is a ""sweet girl."" Eilis is a person of few words, but when she does talk her tone implies a wisdom and curiosity not outwardly evident. She is an avid letter writer and it's a shame she couldn't have shown more of that personality to her daily associates.Thirdly, I find period movies like this to be annoying because the clothes all look so new and clean, like everyone just stepped out of wardrobe (which they no doubt did). Could they put some of the clothes through 100 washes to at least make them look used? It's also the same with the period cars, like they borrowed them from collectors and wouldn't dare to get them dirty. Finally, why didn't it occur to Eilis to invite her mother to come live with her and Tony in America? That situation is not totally unheard of. In fact, there is a house design common in Queens, and probably Brooklyn, too, known as a ""Mother-Daughter home"" because it has a family living area downstairs and a smaller unit on the second floor."
BROOKLYN,27 March 2016,9/10,"Those of you who have read my review of Colm Tóibín's book will know that I didn't think much of it. I think I described it as a lightweight piece of fluff that didn't draw me in as there is so little dialogue.So I really wasn't expecting much from the movie – especially when a friend told me he hated it.How wrong could I be?It turned out to be a blessing in disguise that the book had so little dialogue in it as it afforded Nick Hornby 'carte blanche' to write the screenplay in his own way – and what a wonderful job he made of it!Almost from the opening credits, I knew I was watching a quality movie. It immediately drew me in, much as the book had driven me away. Amazingly, there were very few changes from the original story, although, as always, they cut some of it out. The ending was so subtly changed, that you can't really call it a change, but it made a world of difference to the enjoyment of the story.Brooklyn was made by people at the very top of their game.The great cinematography, the expert direction, the sparkling dialogue, the music, the costumes, the sets I could go on and on. Brooklyn is what movie making is all about.Set in the early 1950's it relates the story of a girl in her early twenties from rural Ireland who immigrates to Brooklyn. A job is awaiting her, arranged by an Irish Catholic Priest. Her struggles to adapt to her new life, her romantic liaisons both in Brooklyn and back in Ireland, form the backbone of the tale.Saoirse Ronan, who plays the lead part of Eilis Lacey, is a wonder to behold. Almost single-handedly she holds the film together and is rarely out of shot. She is truly a towering presence who commands our enraptured attention. The supporting cast is also pretty good, including the great Julie Waters who plays the owner of the Brooklyn boarding house where Eilis lives, and the redoubtable Jim Broadbent, who plays Father Flood.The film magically captures the spirit of the time and you really feel that you have been transported back to rural Ireland and bustling Brooklyn in an age when morals and social behaviour were so different to what they are today.A lightweight story it may be, but the producers saw a gem in Tóibín's tale that has turned his book into a magnificent film.Tóibín is a very lucky man."
BROOKLYN,19 January 2016,9/10,"Simply saying, its a sweet movie that passes so gently that feels like flying. Nothing in the movie is best but everything is great.I agree that I couraged to see it because of its Oscar nomination. All the small tiny elements are so put into it that there is a sense of originality into this 'drama'. Its a drama movie, because it is cute, not realistic and not a high grade movie-like movie, its sweet, the music keeps it alive, its aim is to give you a time to simply smile, and not to make a permanent impression.It doesn't feels to intend to teach one anything, its simply a story, one can cherish the habitants of the boarding house, the family of the Italian guy, lovely sister and the people that plays their part. Costume seems satisfying as well as acting, cinematography and the direction."
BROOKLYN,17 December 2020,8/10,"Many would probably be sceptical about this 2015 book adaptation by director John Crowley after reading the premise for the first time. A young, inexperienced woman from a small town in Ireland travels to the big and scary America where, after an initial rough road, she later meets the love of her life. Sounds like a classic tearjerker, but is much more than that due to its enormous depth and an outstanding leading actress.Saoirse Ronan almost single-handedly manages to put the cliché of the gushy romance to rest early on in the film. She starts off as an enormously shy newcomer who doesn't really know where she stands in life and in the social hierarchy. As she progresses, as she is able to confide in more and more people, she becomes more confident and also more extroverted in a very discreet way. This makes her performance very versatile and prompts one to follow her development closely throughout the film. Emory Cohen delivers a very emotional performance as the man by her side, but sometimes he falls into that very cliché of exuberance. Often his presence next to Ronan also seems rather indifferent, which is of course also due to her strong performance. Their chemistry is very natural in many moments and seems very real to you, but also somewhat unbalanced at times.Brooklyn starts off enormously well and is never really boring despite its simple plot. Yes, the film takes a lot of time in some scenes, but that is exactly what is needed to understand the romance and above all the protagonists tug-of-war. It is not only a coming of age and love story, but also reveals the contrast between two completely different cultures, namely life in the big New York and in the small Irish town where everybody knows and talks about everybody. For this, the film could well have been longer than 107 minutes. Towards the end, a lot of action is packed into a relatively short period of time, which makes the ending rather rushed. If this had been handled a little better, Brooklyn would have been a romantic masterpiece. As it is, however, it is a very beautiful film that is much more than a simple romance."
BROOKLYN,10 August 2016,8/10,"Nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, Brooklyn tells the story of Eilis (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish woman who emigrates to New York City to escape the prospect-less and dour Ireland. She suffers from inevitable homesickness despite the presence of friendly Brits Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent. Eventually she grows accustomed to 1950s American life with the help of dream Italian boy Emory Cohen, yet the call of the Irish remains strong...It's easy to see why this was nominated for Oscars - it's also easy to see why it could be disparaged as dull Oscar bait. But it's actually far from this. Brooklyn is a charming film, and much more enjoyable than you may expect. This is due in part to Ronan's excellent performance, which is grounded in realism and fashions a thoroughly sympathetic protagonist - though some of her decisions and withholding of information are sure to frustrate viewers. There is great support from rising star Cohen, acting as a real draw for Eilis to remain in NYC, in addition to the erstwhile and increasingly famous Domhnall Gleeson, playing an Irish boy who turns Eilis' eye when she returns to Ireland. The regions of NYC and Ireland each act as separate characters themselves, acting as attractive or unattractive to Eilis depending on her feelings. The period design is beautiful and great attention to detail is paid. About a Boy author Nick Hornby's script is insightful and unexpectedly witty, plus the music is well chosen and suits the setting well. Overall, Brooklyn is a great technical feat that is also enjoyable and just plain fun to watch. It suffers a little from being too idyllic, though. It seems a little cynical to count this as a disadvantage, but everyone Eilis encounters is just really, well, nice. Apart from a cantankerous old Irish shopkeeper who employed her for a while, there is no human villain. This is not necessarily bad - in fact, it is rather refreshing not to have a clichéd villain-vanquishing subplot. However, it does detract from the realism of the piece and therefore takes the viewer out of the experience a little. Yet nonetheless Brooklyn remains a lovely little bit of filmmaking which showcases the various extended talents of several industry figures. Certainly the most lightweight of an Oscar bunch which included the harrowing drama of 'Room', the exhilarating lunacy of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and the gritty violent survival experience of Iñarittu's 'The Revenant'. Yet it is definitely worth a watch and if you think it will be a dreary and uneventful stuffy period piece which will not hold your interest, you will probably find yourself wrong. 84/100"
BROOKLYN,27 April 2015,8/10,"Set in the 1950s, a young Irish woman emigrates to New York for a life with better prospects. Initially she misses home but gradually adapts to her new lifestyle and secretly marries.She returns to Ireland for a visit after the death of her sister, who was looking after her mother. Despite intending that her return is to be brief she begins to settle back into her previous Irish life.She reacquaints herself with old friends and a possible romance with a local lad begins to develop. She is torn between fondness for her old life in Ireland with a new romance and the excitement of her new life across the Atlantic with her husband. She is faced with the decision of a lifetime. Whilst there's nothing new in this story it deals with recurring themes well. A sweet, charming drama with wonderful acting and touching moments."
BROOKLYN,27 March 2016,10/10,"Two-time Academy Award Nominee Saoirse Ronan is as extraordinary as she is beautiful in Brooklyn. Set in the 1950s a young Irish woman is torn between her homeland and the United States. Her character has ambition and romance on her mind. She's strong and smart. The cast here maybe mostly unrecognizable but is superb. Especially handsome Emory Cohen who plays Tony. It's about family, respect, hard work, the things we love, ambition and most of all romantic love. It is a treasure trove of a movie about the the things we value most in life. It's perfect for a Sunday afternoon and brings enchantment. If only there were more movies like this one."
BROOKLYN,17 November 2015,9/10,"So the ending is pretty much the classic one you'd expect from Hollywood (even if it ain't a Hollywood production). After all, who in her right mind would abandon her chance to live in the land of plenty versus a dreary, down-at-the-heels Irish village filled with petty-minded people? To his credit, the screenwriter kept the tension of the choice sustained, and did not present the alternative Irish lover with any obvious flaws--which would have made the choice self-evident. Indeed, for much of the visit interlude, ""Eilis"" seemed genuinely taken with ""Jimmy Farrell""--and I have to admit that my wife and I were rooting for her to choose him--though we knew full well that ""America"" had to win out in the end (and we knew that because there are no ""accidental encounters"" in a ""Hollywood"" script: how else to account for the insertion of the scene at city hall with the ""chance encounter"" with a young woman from Eilis' town--who then ""happens"" to be related to Miss Kelly, the grocer?).Wallace Stegner once remarked that America is divided between the ""boomers"" and the ""stickers"". The former are always prepared to move on to more promising territory (the next great ""boom"" in the roller- coaster economy), regardless of ties to family and place. The ""stickers"" are those who, despite tough times and a ""hard-scrabble"" life, try to make the best of it and stick it out because of the importance of place and kith and kin.It would have been nice if just once we gave some credit to the ""stickers"" and had Eilis hanging in there with family, friends, and the town and the seashore she loved (despite all the flaws). That would have been too much to hope for, especially given the ""inconvenience"" of her marriage to ""Tony"". Nonetheless, I'd have opted for a toss-up that would have let the audience decide. After all, a civil marriage is not recognized by the Catholic Church as binding, so divorce is not out of the question for Eilis. So here's an alternative ending: Eilis writes to Tony to say that she's fallen in love with another man and that she'd like Tony to agree to a divorce. Tony refuses to give her a divorce, and insists that she come back to Brooklyn to contest it in person, believing that he will succeed in making her fall back in love with him. As she wanders out to the Irish seashore and looks out over the sea, she contemplates her choices,.....FINNone of the above takes away from the deeply moving and affecting performance of Saoirse Ronan, who had me tearful for much of the movie. And the movie does raise the interesting question as to whether a woman can love two men equally at the same time."
BROOKLYN,4 July 2017,8/10,"I wasn't really feeling this movie, when I first heard about it but, it had caught my attention. I finally watched it recently and it was perfect. I am very picky when it comes to romance moves but, Brooklyn blew me away. I am going to be reading the novel soon, Brooklyn is definitely one of my favorites.Really enjoyed it. Went from a perfectly pleasant coming of age story to some real deep meaning about identity, home, love, and career. Didn't see any problems with it. It got pretty dramatic and heavy at times, all while sticking with the same tone. I guess the only issue I had with it is that it was kind of slow at the beginning and I wasn't absolutely in love with it.--- From Yidioo"
BROOKLYN,12 February 2021,6/10,"So the girl left her homeland for a better life, got a job, had the best two elders taking care of her living and sending her to classes, and married to a decent Italian guy. Then she went back to Ireland for a month because her sister died. In this month she caught up with old friends, and met a charming guy from childhood. Got threatened(?) by the old lady from the grocery store when she was about to cheat on her newly married husband, and then she went back to Brooklyn. Well, sorry, I'm not so into this kind of stories even though they made it looks beautiful :) The Italian guy's 8-year-old brother is the cutest."
BROOKLYN,1 February 2016,7/10,"Another day, another Best Picture nomination. This time around, the romantic drama Brooklyn. So, as I've been doing so far, here's what IMDb says the movie is about:""An Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.""This one made me feel a lot like last year's Best Picture nominee The Theory of Everything made me feel. The backdrop of the film is infinitely more interesting than the actual story that the film is presenting. The story of Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) leaving her family to come to America and start over is a genuinely interesting one, and an experience so many could relate to during that time.The problem arises when you overlay the incredibly bland love story on top of it. The focus of the movie is Ronan's character's finding a man, and it does this in a very unremarkable, and standard way. Nothing about the movie feels especially unique or special. Particularly when you take into account the nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Lead Actress for Ronan.Saoirse does a fine job in the movie, but it's the pieces around her that make this feel like nothing special. Just as I've said with the other Best Picture nominees, these are not BAD films. When you put them up into a category that calls them BEST of the year, however, being ""Just fine"" isn't quite enough.If you like love stories then check this one out, if not then... don't?Wonderfully, this is a movie who's cast is almost entirely women. So it does have that edge on the other Best Picture nominations. With that said, the number of characters who make meaningful contributions to the plot, and are not cisgendered, heteronormative, white men or women is *drum roll* ZERO.A quick Google let me know that this movie does pass the Bechdel Test though, so that's something."
BROOKLYN,8 August 2016,8/10,"I didn't expect much and that is probably why I enjoyed this movie so much. This is an old fashioned love story with throbbing longing and quiet moments. The movie flows along without effort. The acting is convincing and I fell in love with the gorgeous character, Tony.Closer to the end I couldn't stomach the anticipation any longer and ended up forwarding to the end to check that I am not going to be disappointed. I promptly rewinded (the terminology probably giving away that Im from the over forty camp) despite watching it on a streaming service.If you're looking for a romantic drama, without the stupidity that comes with the most recent romantic comedies, then this is a sure winner."
BROOKLYN,20 March 2018,5/10,"The main weakness with this rather tame film is the male lead.His uncharismatic character does not impose itself on the film and Ronan's character.So the film is unbalanced with Ronan a strong performer,helped by the close-ups on her pale eyes and enigmatic expression.
I didn't buy the attraction other than availability,nor the speed of blossoming love.Then a toe-curling dinner scene with the family including a bizarre younger sibling(well singposted).The giggling girls at the boarding house got a little repetitive .Only when she returned to Ireland did the film open up and although it was predictable she would fall for someone else and dither it was too much to hope she would stay behind.
In a William Trevor story she may have."
BROOKLYN,8 April 2016,6/10,"Saoirse Ronan plays the young Irish woman Elis who in the 1950's leaves her family behind for a new life in New York. She enters the country through the back then famous border controls on Ellis Island. She lives with an older strict Irish lady and a couple of other young ladies also from Ireland. Domhnall Gleeson and Julie Walters play supporting roles. The film is directed by the unknown Irishman John Crowley and made on a relatively small budget.Brooklyn is an interesting film about the emigration of the Irish people, to an America they thought would be better, richer and more free. There Elis falls in love with a young Italian man and starts to work in a lady department at a fancy store. The homesickness for Ireland and her family is constant and the film does balance between her love for Ireland and the dream of a life in America. One is not necessarily better than the other. Brooklyn goes on in a relatively slow but OK tempo. The strongest scene in the film is definitely when the forgotten Irish workers, who built New York city, have a Christmas dinner and a man stands up and sings an old Irish song.The problem with Brooklyn is that the film never really takes off. Just like in the film Carol I don't feel like Elis really has that many problems and difficulties. She handles herself pretty good most of the time. She also faces decisions with rather mild consequences. In short, it could have been a little bit more dramatic. Brooklyn is still very good looking and interesting with great cinematography, music and production design. The 1950's New York looks very good and it is a nice contrast to Ireland's bare countryside. In some ways I feel like the film is trying to find and create an identity for Americans with Irish roots, and I think it actually succeeds in doing this. Especially in the scene with the beautiful Irish song. I grade it a six.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
BROOKLYN,4 March 2018,7/10,"The awesome and lovely Brooklyn movie - 2015 and the genre of drama and romance.
In the true sense, doubts is the most appropriate word in the key moments of the movie stream, the audience in an inner challenge is in the position and getting right from the first character of the story in that moments.
Especially when in the film we find that the personality of the first character of the story, Ronan Saurice, as Ellis, is a highly introverted, conservative and literary human.
On the other hand, the situation for the first character of the story is such that returning home with a rotation of one hundred and eighty degrees of livelihood situation and working conditions.
Doubts and finally thinking, perhaps by coercion, but ultimately by accepting particular conditions in a unique way, this film has to be seen with the world and more angles familiar to introverted people emotionally."
BROOKLYN,20 February 2016,10/10,"Folks in all the years I have commented on IMDb I have never given a 10 to any other movie and I am a movie addict who has watched countless films. To begin, the writer of this script is a very accomplished person as there is never a dull, boring or repetitive moment in this incredible movie. It gives an inside perspective on a young Irish woman's American experience as she begins a new life in the United States. The decency and sensitivity of the movie are to be applauded in our current world of one night stands, the shedding of moral values and the minimization of true romantic love. At one point toward the end I was beginning to get a bit uneasy as to where the plot was headed but instead of disappointing me the screen play writer brought the story to a wonderful conclusion."
BROOKLYN,27 November 2015,9/10,"By Romanticism I don't mean a romance between a man and a woman (chick flick). But the Romanticism of Ireland - it's people and beauty; and of the deep nostalgia of post WWII Brookly. This is a beautiful film with several good characters - even with flaws. The cinematography is fantastic. The acting is superb. Altogether I'd give this an 8.4-8.5 (though that's not permitted so I give it an 8). Two particular points that I find to be of great interest is how evil works in the world. Sometimes through particular individuals (not the over-the-top villain types as in Bond films; but just people who are filled with some bitterness that in turn make life more difficult for others around them). But, secondly, sometimes just through circumstances and timing in life that is bad - and creates both conundrums and moral challenges through no fault of an individual. Both of these (without giving away any of the film) are present. I find that when films and stories are able to capture these truisms to life - without being films that have total despair and emptiness within them - they are the best. And, this points toward the hope and dream that all have within their life. Yet, also bring out the futility of life's circumstances - pointing ultimately in my view toward a yet-unfulfilled hoped for future that all long for beyond this world."
BROOKLYN,8 September 2016,8/10,"The movie is visually beautiful. The portrayal of Brooklyn and Ireland was spectacular. Saoirse Ronan's acting in the movie is great. The whole time i watched it, she made me feel what she herself was actually going through in the story.The story on the other hand is a very simple one, yet it felt 'enough'......maybe because a normal iris girls life was like this in real life back then. And for this reason the story feels more authentic and touching to go through.The making of the movie is good, sound is decent and acting of everyone is obviously great. I would say its a movie worth watching."
BROOKLYN,10 October 2020,9/10,The casting for this film was excellent. Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen really shined IMO. Google Play Movies gave me a couple of $0.99 rentals and I am extremely pleased that I chose to redeem one to watch this movie. It's 5 years old and hasn't popped up on any of the streaming services or cable channels I subscribe to. My guess is that it has fared so well based on word of mouth reviews that there hasn't been a need to move away from the direct online rental/purchase business model. If you have a few bucks laying around and are looking for something enjoyable to watch you can't go wrong with this one.
BROOKLYN,19 December 2015,6/10,"I had little empathy for the heroine of this story because she has almost no obstacles to overcome. Okay, she's got a cranky boss. Fortunately, her sister has saved up enough money to send her to America--where the parish priest has already found accommodation for her. And, where everybody is nice to her. And where a sincere, kind and handsome man courts her and proposes marriage. Oh, and the parish priest pays for her schooling. And she breezes through her exams because she's smart as a whip.Then, about halfway through the movie, tragedy strikes. But it's an event so sudden and so far away that there's really nothing our heroine can--or is expected to--do anything about it. So while it's sad and unfortunate, it's nothing she can act on.Phew! For a moment there, I thought our protagonist might actually have to do something besides accept the next kind offer of assistance.Returning to Ireland, she's courted by considerate, handsome fella #2. But to make matters worse. . . she's offered a high-paying office job--doing the very thing she aced all her exams in! Will the tribulations of this woman never end? For a while, I was afraid she might win the lottery.The worst thing to happen to her is that she gets seasick and is locked out of the head. SHE HAS TO USE A BUCKET. Oh, the humanity! Someone should have told the screenwriter that this is an insufficient problem to build a drama around."
BROOKLYN,18 January 2016,9/10,"Brooklyn is one of the most charming films ever, it has a palpable charm, that really elevates the film and along with a mesmerizing performance from Saoirse Ronan, makes you fall in love with it.The screenplay is wonderful, the story is just amazing, and it is a story that you can easily relate to, with its themes of immigration, home, family, and love. While i don't think the second half of the film is as strong as the sublime first half, and i feel it could have benefited with another scene or two exploring the main character, Eilis thoughts, the film as a whole is really great. The visuals are really beautiful, and the production values are really strong, the cinematography is wonderful, but it definitely would have benefited just a little more with a just a tiny bit bigger budget to show more vistas of Brooklyn, and Ireland.There's great characters, and the cast is really great, everyone gives stunning performances, especially the two leads, but obviously the one that completely steals the show, is Saoirse Ronan. She makes the amazing one in a million character feel, as is the idea, real, someone that seems to exist. She just makes you fall in love with the film, its like shes the son and you are pulled to her orbit, she's truly mesmerizing and her Oscar nomination for best actress really reflects that.Brooklyn has a rare feel of reality and enhanced drama. But overall the film seems so real that you cant help but feel like you're watching a true story. And i was surprised at the amount of comedy it has, and think its because of its charm, because the humour is really charming, i never thought to laugh as much as i did, but almost all the humour is on the first half, as the second one is more intense.Brooklyn is definitely a must see."
BROOKLYN,13 March 2021,1/10,I am shocked that this film received so many awards nomination and awards. I watched this film after seeing good reviews. While watching the film eilis 's character did get on my nerves. I don't enjoy the film if i start hating the main character. She is selfish and cheating girl. How can someone possibly like her. I don't know how this film is categorize as love story. This is not love. She never loved any of them .if she have loved her husband then should would never cheat. If she loved the another man she should be truthful with him. I don't know why people support such kind of films.
BROOKLYN,22 March 2020,8/10,"The scenery along the way has been changing, leaving traces at every step we take, we can go forward, but it is difficult to turn back. Therefore, when accustomed to the original strange environment, it is the second ""home""."
BROOKLYN,3 February 2016,7/10,"There is always a place in theaters for flawless romances. Brooklyn is not ambitious. This love story is timeworn and the characters are mostly caricatures. But Brooklyn is built on such solid foundations that all its simplicity is just peripheral. The plot is passionate, tragic, full circle, and all tied together. No dialogue or joke is ever awkward. The 50's setting is held at a dreamy distance that somehow feels centuries away. Brooklyn is a feel good movie sans personal embarrassment. A film I could universally recommend.Brooklyn is the coming of age story of Irish Catholic girl Eilis, who leaves her country and family behind for a life with a future. There is not a trace of darkness or maliciousness in this take of a classic story. Natural challenges arise and vanquished as Eilis develops. The evolution of this character is the crux. Saoirse Ronan is currently nominated for an Oscar for this performance and she is perfectly deserving. Ellis begins shy and overwhelmed, but ends worldly, talented, and confident. This does not mean that Ellis' life necessarily grows easier, rather problems become progressively complex. All of this cultivation is surrounded by color. All side characters are enjoyable and well-acted. The cinematography is gorgeous. Ireland is quaint with a simple natural beauty. 50's Brooklyn is a burgeoning paradise of opportunity. I would love to inhabit either of these nostalgic existences.Eilis follows a straightforward trajectory until the final act. Nothing original, but equally never boring. The climax is a dramatic test of Eilis' love and newfound strength. Unfortunately, Brooklyn robs Eilis of the final life determining decision, costing the movie any chance at greatness. The final act explicates the enormity and complexity so well. Being denied a verdict in exchanged for a convenient resolution was extremely frustrating. Admittedly, it is difficult to stay angry at this decision. It is in tune with a major theme of the story. I concede this was a creative decision, not a tactic to sell more tickets. Annoyance subsides into craving. My greatest criticism is simply wanting more. I cannot think of a better testament to Brooklyn's strength."
BROOKLYN,20 October 2016,9/10,"OK. Full disclosure. I am an old guy who favors action films and historical epics. Romantic films of today usually leave me squirming and wanting to be doing anything else but watching. This film has me in tears more than I care to admit.I come from an Irish background and spent part of my early childhood in an ethnic neighborhood surrounded by immigrants of various backgrounds. This film captures the innocence, hope and texture of that background. The acting was superb, the directing engulfed me in a time sorely missed. There is magic in this creation. In part it made me sad for the best parts of America which seem to be so lacking in today's society. I am not ashamed that I enjoyed this film so much just surprised. I think that is what a truly excellent piece of art does. Not just entertain but bring a depth of emotion to the viewer that surprises. I recommend this film with no reservations. With all the crap put out by the industry of today this is a true gem."
BROOKLYN,3 January 2016,,"....I thought this was a terrific movie,that actually made me appreciate the Movie,'PHOENIX'(Nina hoss), much more.Although both are romantic movies,one of which ends happily ever after,the other(Hoss)sort of leaves you hanging. WHat I meant by that is when you see a woman of such beauty(Ronan),you sort of know going in(first 5 minutes)that no matter how the director dresses it up(excuse me,dresses it down)w/ trials & tribulations, crisis, heartbreaks,death in the family,etc,everything sort of works out in the end(it ends well for everybody).Whereas w/ Phoenix,also a beautiful woman,but the 2 films really share very little in common.I mean no matter how you dress it up,anybody that comes out of a concentration camp,even if you survive,I mean you sort of know going in (first 5 minutes)that no matter how the director dresses it up(she has surgery which restores her beauty,she finds her ex-husband,etc), it probably is not going to end well). ... .....Also,I thought Ronan bore a passing(not a striking,just a passing)resemblance to that goofy,deadpan comic wife,Morticia(Addams family);not the facial features,just the lips. Also, she reminded me of Lady Mary Crawley (Downton Abbey),in that Ronan seems to have a multitude of facial expressions that convey emotion,w/o ever having to utter a single sentence! Whereas Dockery seems to have only 2 facial expressions,one conveying total shock, & the other conveying total gratification,ie, she has to say out loud what she is thinking,or you do not know what she is conveying. But other than the fact that I thought it would be a better title,""Jackson heights"", I rate this movie 10 out of 10,since I have never lived in either borough.(i liked the part where she repeats the advice to a newbie arriving at Ellis island,the exact same advice given to her years earlier...)>>STOP"
BROOKLYN,7 November 2015,7/10,"Brooklyn is written by Nick Hornby and directed by John Crowley. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, and Domhanall Gleeson.An Irish immigrant lands in 1950's Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a new romance. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.This movie feels an awful lot like a Merchant Ivory movie, before they went downhill. This is probably the best period piece of the year simply because Brooklyn embraces the type of movie it is, whole heatedly.Brooklyn, in my humble opinion, is a wrought melodrama that is equal parts quaint as it is provocatively made. This movie was made to be perfect and that might very well be its largest flaw. Though that thought is paradoxical, it is well founded. Aside from my minor griping, I did appreciate this movie in its entirety.My personal favorite part of the movie, which I noticed from the very beginning, was the immaculate cinematography, done by Yves Bélanger. Though to the common movie goers eye it seems rather ordinary, but to me it was what made the movie so engaging. The gentile blend of light and dark colors inside and outside make the movie well worth seeing on the big screen in its own right, but what really got me was the deft mixing of colors at the dining scenes where the beauty of Saoirse Ronan was brought out through her, emphasized, kind smile and innocent eyes.Speaking of the lead actress, Saoirse Ronan was impeccably cast in this movie. She plays her role magically and brings a lot to the metaphorical and literal table. She pulls off a role that people 3 times her age would have a hard time doing; given the fact that someone 3 times as old as her wouldn't be cast to play a 19 year old accountant. Ronan plays a sympathetic and quirky lead so well that she bring Ellis Lacey to life.The same goes for Emory Cohen in his portrayal as Tony, Ellis' new Italian boyfriend in the States. The two make a remarkable pair, with phenomenal chemistry and finesse. Cohen plays a large part in this movie and understands that he needed to strike a perfect blend of desperation, love and believability.The same can be said about Brooklyn's script and tender direction. The art of creating a drama is like walking a tight rope, filled with sharp and jagged edges known to all as clichés. This movie, for the most part, avoids these dreaded obstacles, by opting to slowly but surely build up its heady themes. Though this may be true, this, said, slow pace and structure can, at times, make the film feel uneventful, which may turn off some viewers. The lucky ones who do stick around are rewarded with a deeply emotionally resonant conclusion, much like the Merchant Ivory classics. Though most clichés are avoided, some were unfortunately injected into the plot, when writer, Nick Hornby, decided to occasionally over dramatize events in the movie. This at times feels desperate and at others feel just redundant, but nevertheless gets the message across to some degree.Brooklyn is an old fashioned period piece that offers fine acting, beautiful cinematography, charming writing grounded in reality, and thought provoking direction. Brooklyn gets a B+ or 7/10."

BROOKLYN,29 July 2018,2/10,"Ugh was this movie boring...like watching paint dry. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because the acting is incredible, but it's totally boring. There was also zero chemistry between Eilis and Tony. I was rooting for her to stay in Ireland, but unfortunately she didn't. Waste of time."
BROOKLYN,12 July 2019,4/10,"Based on the title I thought its a deep movie.. But it's just a simple romance movie.. It's not deep enough to show all the struggles of her trying to start her life in a new country.. Everything is being planned for her.. The only struggle is the homesick.. The romance between her and Tony felt loose.. It feels like Jim is a better guy for her.. Her character is inconsistent.. In earlier part of the movie she is shown as a reasonable, kind and sweet person.. But suddenly she is mean to the new girl..and refused to reply her husband's letters.. The one who she hastily married.. And all of a sudden she realised she wants to choose him and leave her mother after she found out that Miss Kelly knows about the marriage..that's it.. Nothing extraordinary about this movie besides the acting."
BROOKLYN,4 March 2016,3/10,"This contains only spoilers, be warned! The movie starts off fairly solid despite being a bit dull and clichéd romance. My problem with the film is how the ending is written - it's not the only problem but is the one that killed any potential of the movie being decent. The protagonist is sweet and innocent but it's to the point of being emotionally cold. I'm not sure she ever really loved the Brooklyn boy, Tony, or if he was just really nice and she could see building a life with him. To confirm this, she returns to Ireland and finds the perfect life waiting for her; great potential husband (Jim), good job, and her mother who she can look after since she is now alone, and she pretty much forgets about Tony. I'm OK with the idea that she wasn't really in love with either boy but was merely torn between two worlds, each with their pros and cons. However, my issue is with the end, we are supposed to believe she realized where her life was and where she wanted to be.... but did she? Miss Kelly, for all of her evilness, didn't do the low thing and embarrassingly out Eilis as already married. Instead, she confronted her face to face. I mean, Eilis was traipsing around for a month leading on poor Jim and not once did she ever give any hint of disinterest. When Miss Kelly confronts her, Eilis up and leaves the next day. Isn't that getting caught in a lie (by omission) and fleeing to the USA? The most offensive part is when she has been found out, Eilis proclaims, ""Now, I remember what I don't like about this town."" Really? Eilis is the one being dishonest(to Jim and her mother). And, if she was married when she first arrived in Brooklyn and then met Tony and lead him on, it would still be scandalous when her secret marriage was exposed. There is no great realization on the part of Eilis and she really didn't choose and that would be OK if the movie treated it as such. To sum it up, the resolution cheapens the whole film."
BROOKLYN,26 September 2015,7/10,"Enjoy this movie for what it is. A simple girl meets boy story, with impeccable acting and luxurious cinematography. True, it's not the highest budget film ever, and so we never really see 1950's Brooklyn. Most the shots of it are in shallow focus, or at night. Personally, I would have liked the movie to have been more grand in scope, especially since it's lovely orchestral score suggested something more akin to an epic historical, but all the shots are fairly closeup. Maybe that was the point. It's a very personal story. Saoirse Ronan, once again turns in a great performance. She is completely believable, and hits all the right notes.The chemistry between her and her love interests doesn't sizzle as well as it could have with better casting on their end, but it doesn't detract from the overall film. Some scenes seem a little melodramatic and overdone: (like when she steps through the gleaming doorway into America for the first time, and also there are some unnecessary slow motion scenes).But, in the end, Brooklyn is a charming tale."
BROOKLYN,12 March 2019,8/10,"In modern times we can forget that until relatively recently, to move across the ocean was hardly any different than it had been hundreds of years ago. Nowadays people with a half decent income can routinely make trips ""to the old country"".I was unsure of this movie because I am not into anything ""romantic"". However, the story is solid and sweet, and about real people... Not idealized people and situations, as so many romantic movies are.The characters are endearing, and I felt a real connection to them. Like most of us in North America our relatives and ancestors came from elsewhere, and in some cases not so long ago - so although I am a third-generation North American, this story was still very close to me.It's absolutely beautifully shot. The sets and clothing are a vintage lovers dream.It's also an important story about life for young women not that long ago.Nestle in and watch it, I'm sure you will love it."
BROOKLYN,20 March 2016,7/10,"A beautifully realised adaptation of Colm Tóibín's classic novel. Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis Lacey, an Irish girl leaving home for a brighter future in 1950's New York.It's a charming film, with the beautiful Ronan giving a polished and emotive performance. Father Flood (a kindly Jim Broadbent) has placed Eilis in the boarding house of Ma Kehoe (Julie Walters playing amusingly to type, but with an Irish accent). Home sick, Eilis meets Italian-American Tony (Emory Cohen) and they fall in love. She slowly blossoms, but then tragedy strikes and she has to return home, where she finds herself unexpectedly receiving the attention of Jim (Domhnall Gleeson). Torn between the excitement of an uncertain future with Tony and a safe alternative with Jim, Eilish is eventually forced to make a decision.This is an unashamedly old fashioned and romantic drama. Beautifully shot and expertly played, particularly by the lovely Saoirse Ronan, this tale has emotional impact and you will find yourself caring about Eilish and her life."
BROOKLYN,7 December 2015,9/10,"I typically feel the word ""speechless"" is overused in commentary; however, for the first time in a long time there could not be a more true emotion felt after seeing this film. ""Seeing"" is not even accurate term- this movie was an experience. Every aspect of this production was simply phenomenal. The historical depiction of social temperament, style, behavior and even setting itself in both Ireland and New York was flawlessly executed. Naturally it struck a chord close to home, as a Dublin girl chasing and capturing her dreams in the big city, but bias aside I am so moved from the scriptwriting, to the production and of course the acting. I strongly urge you to experience this masterpiece."
BROOKLYN,23 December 2018,9/10,Soooooooo goooood IIII LOOOVEEEE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
BROOKLYN,14 May 2019,10/10,"Can't ask for anything more, good actresses, great dialogue, nostalgic and VERY real settings, Frankie's song was the icing on the cake. Would like to see more of these with perhaps a modern context? Hope and positivity doesn't always come from having 5 mansions and supercars."
BROOKLYN,21 November 2015,10/10,"This film was the best film of this year. It was a simple story. Thank God,someone wrote a simple story with a heart. There are not too many films like this these days. Its a story of a simple Irish girl who follows her dreams to come to America and falls in love. She meets this Italian guy who totally loves her. The film gave me more understanding of Irish culture and how people were more thick skinned in the 50's. This is a universal film and anyone can relate to the film as we have all fallen in love and longed for beloved ones. I had my eyes filled with tears while watching intimate and emotional scenes in Brooklyn.Ahhh..loved it. The acting is superb and Soierse Ronan definitely deserves an Oscar for her powerful and amazing performance. This film will definitely be up for many Oscars for story, cinematography, music and acting.One thing which I wanted to mention was (if the filmmakers see this), I felt that scene of Elise not opening her husband letters made me feel betrayed for one moment. I thought Elise would never do that. If she was just hiding her secret from her own town or she was afraid to tell anyone, it should have been mentioned by Elise as I was so much into this character that Elise, after going to Ireland and ignoring her husband's letters made me feel that she betrayed her true love. Although later I understood what she went through but I just could not imagine Elise betraying me. (hassanzee@gmail.com)"
BROOKLYN,7 April 2017,8/10,"Brooklyn is in every way entertaining to watch. The Best thing about it, is the well written dialogue, which makes you laugh or grin happily. That's also just possible because of the often likable but always interesting characters, whether it's the quirky matron, the smooth Italian or the self-made women. The main character is more believable in comparison, but falls a little flat. Saoirse Ronan, nevertheless, is amazing in this role. She really should be in more movies. Don't watch the trailer of this movie. It's giving away too much. I read in another critic, that the main character has no real problems. I disagree strongly. Yeah, her problems aren't big social, political or economic issues or life-threatening in a direct way, but she has to struggle with big matters of her own life. Leaving her family, especially her sad mother, forever alone and deciding for her own life. It's not just a choice between two men. They are just symbols of two different paths of life. So in some way it's basically a coming of age story. This is not a new story nor is it the best depiction of it, however it's a good one. And if you're having a date, it's perfect."
BROOKLYN,22 December 2015,9/10,"I enjoyed it very much. It was a sweet movie and I really liked both main characters. That little brother was so cute and funny and loved it!What happened to Irish tap dance?! I expected to see that!Also one of the girls talking to her by the bathroom played as a major actress in a great movie: Magdalen SistersThe reason I didn't give 10 is because I thought he should have come with her to Ireland since they were already married or she should have taken her mother with going back to Brooklyn! Well, it was based on a novel so couldn't expect it I guess. Overall every single immigrant could relate to this someway or the other. It was good era, The America!"
BROOKLYN,10 April 2016,7/10,"A thoroughly well turned-out affair from start to finish, and spoilingly endowed with genuinely memorable performances (Emory Cohen particularly impressive as Tony, IMHO) - but all the way through it was this same ""well turned outness"" that bugged me. That was the trouble: TOO well turned out by half! Nick Hornby's script was quite rich enough in emotional content to stand on its own feet. Indeed, it would have been well served by visuals that showed us the grit and reality of life for people in both 1950s Ireland and Brooklyn. Instead, it had to contend with being schmaltzed half to death by the constantly overdone ""let's put another nostalgia-glow honeyed sunlight effect filter on that shot"" photography.The same sugary approach was also painfully evident in the costume and make-up work. On telling her boarding house companions that she has volunteered to serve Christmas dinner to homeless men, Eilis is warned by her house-mates about how ""stinky"" they are. Well you'd never have known it by the look of 'em! I've never seen a more immaculately scrubbed-up, robust and healthy set of tramps in all my life: every one sporting scrupulously clean hair, a healthily un-haggard complexion and clothes that had obviously just come fresh from the costumiers. As far as I could see, no attempt whatever had been made at breaking down the garments. The only stink I had to reel away from was that of industrial dry-cleaning fluid. The story may be set in the 1950s, but heavens... I really didn't expect the artificial, squeaky-clean production values of that era as well!"
BROOKLYN,11 January 2021,5/10,"After watching Little Women and Ladybird featuring Saorise Ronan, I cannot count how many times i have searched her up on google. With high hopes for this movie, it left me feeling me empty and lost for the ending. This is not Saorise Ronan's fault, she accurately depicted her character's emotions, rather the STORYLINE and PLOT'S PROBLEM with making it CLICHE AND PREDICTABLE. I kept hoping for a twist at the end, and maybe this wasn't a waste of time, there was none."
BROOKLYN,1 August 2018,1/10,"Honestly, can't get my head around this one. Standing ovations at Sundance? Really? For this?So Saorse Ronan plays an emotionally blank young woman with a perpetual look of slightly pained superfluity, who emigrates to New York from a picture-postcard Ireland, depicted as a pursed, gossipy village of church-on-Sunday piousness and coded snobbery. Once in the Big Apple she drifts meekly through a succession of not-very-interesting adventures, with the blandest supporting cast of cardboard cutouts assembled in any film since the 1950s. Eventually she ends up back in Ireland for a stretch, works as an accountant (the drama!) and walks on the beach a couple of times with Donal Gleeson, before having a teacup spat with the old cow that she used to work for and deciding, almost reluctantly, to return to her husband in the 'States.And that's it.While it's basically inoffensive fluff, the sheer volume and intensity of critical praise heaped on this picture completely beggars belief. Ronan, while watchable, is entirely one-note from start to finish. The entire supporting cast are pasted in from kiddult romances from the 1950s, with cheerful stereotypes taking the place of any meaningful character development. Slavishly constructed around Ronan's mooney presence, the film floats aimlessly across the screen, providing neither insight into its lead character's emotional life or throwing up any truly troubling obstacles for her to overcome. In the end, so little happens, and all the characters are so thinly drawn that the viewer (or this one anyway) finds themself asking, ""what did I just watch, and was I supposed to care? If so, why did they make the lead character so dismally, relentlessly uninteresting? Why did she ditch the quirky, outspoken girl in her boarding house for the shallow, mean-spirited bimbos she works with? Was she actually into the young bloke she was romancing back home, or was he just a pleasing distraction? Would she really have left her husband just like that? Why wasn't he more angry with her for not writing or calling?""Ultimately, with stakes this low, such an empty lead character and a story so devoid of dramatic incident it's almost astonishing that this even garnered a theatrical release, let alone the fulsome admiration of critics worldwide."
BROOKLYN,3 January 2016,9/10,"I was not expecting how wonderful this film was going to be. What a beautiful tale of love, family, heartbreak, your ties to home and seeking somewhere new. Saoirse Ronan was incredible in her role, what a fantastic young actress. I felt her character's pain and longing and celebrated her happiness, finding where she belonged and finding inner peace. What a time to be alive in Brooklyn/NYC in the 1950's. The fashion and cars and entertainment. It all played a part in shaping the film into what it was. I was impressed how well the culture was incorporated into the storyline. The film was not over the top, it was simple and elegant and portrayed all the emotions you are are meant to feel perfectly. Moving and beautiful, something that has stayed with me. I thoroughly enjoyed Brooklyn and highly recommend it."
BROOKLYN,23 January 2016,5/10,"I'm not as impressed with Brooklyn as I had hoped to be. Despite the talented actors involved, the fact that the title of the film removes any doubt as to the outcome and the less than exceptional writing and directing leaves me indifferent. There is little to no character development for anyone involved in the story other than the lead and it seems as if the vast majority of the film is purely background and lead up to a conflict which is over almost before it began. Brooklyn is okay to watch on a lazy day when one has nothing else to do but there are several better options available at the theatre at this time."
BROOKLYN,24 March 2018,7/10,"In all honesty I did like this movie. Saoirse Ronan's acting was beautiful as always but the movie ended too quickly for me. Suddenly there was 10 minutes left and not enough has happened for me. But I give this film 7/10 because this film is sweet, not a masterpiece but enjoyable to watch."
BROOKLYN,7 January 2016,8/10,"This charming film is admirably scripted, shot and acted. It's also an interesting psychological study and morally more complex than it may seem at first.Initially we see Eilis ('Aylish') Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) overcoming her youthful gaucherie and gaining in confidence. I found that her diffidence and repressed emotion generated quite uncomfortable feelings at times. The effect is heightened by some strikingly searching close-ups, which Saoirse Ronan withstands very well.The story's date, 1952, is established quite subtly by a reference to the film 'The Quiet Man' and a brief shot of a poster for 'Singing in the Rain'. There is also an air of postwar drabness, especially in the Irish scenes which portray an oppressively inward-looking small community. However, Eilis's life in Brooklyn isn't very different socially from Enniscorthy, County Wexford – at least not until she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), whose family is Italian. Enniscorthy is the home town of the source novel's author, Colm Tóibín.The characters' backgrounds are obviously representative of the crucial role of immigration in the USA. Also important is the Catholic Church: Eilis obtains accommodation, a job and vocational training thanks to an Irish priest, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent, in a more substantial role than he has in 'The Lady in the Van'). As the story goes on, however, she is not such a good Catholic girl... The sudden death of Eilis's sister, Rose (Fiona Glascott), might smack of emotional manipulation. It's explained away as due to a long-concealed illness. Yet it serves an underlying dramatic purpose: Eilis is ultimately ready to leave her bereaved mother, Mary (Jane Brennan), all alone and doesn't even offer to bring Tony to meet her. This doesn't reflect well on her, morally speaking.Her mother comes to appear a rather tragic figure. After visiting her, Eilis's return to Brooklyn is convincingly precipitated when the mean-spirited shopkeeper Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan) reveals that she has heard about her wedding to Tony. This forces Eilis to tell her mother.Miss Kelly is rather stereotyped and might be called a 'dea ex machina' (deus ex machina: a device in Greek tragedy for saving a character in a seemingly hopeless situation). In both respects she could seem to be a weakness in the film. However, she has a surprising function, which is neatly conveyed, inadvertently resolving a potential dilemma for Eilis and enabling her to resist temptation.Miss Kelly brings Eilis down to earth as well: it seemed as though all the young woman's Christmases had come at once and she had appeared pretty self-centred. Whether by accident or design, this story has moral ambiguity at its heart.The film doesn't, however, lack humour. I think the scene in which Eilis impresses Tony's Italian family with her dexterity in eating spaghetti is especially funny. She reveals that another young woman at her boarding house has taught her to avoid splashing sauce over the walls - and over other diners. Adding to the hilarity is James DiGiacomo, aged 10, as Tony's kid brother: he steals the show every time."
BROOKLYN,10 February 2016,3/10,"Every year when the best movie nominations are revealed, I watch all of them to decide if they are worthy. I was surprised that Brooklyn is nominated because I have no idea why. The acting is good from every one involved. Saoirse Ronan as usual shows her limitless talent. However I have trouble caring about the events in her life or the characters. These events are meant to be extraordinary - migrating to a foreign land, overcoming homesickness to thrive in the new environment, falling in love and marrying someone from another culture as well as losing a beloved family member back home. It seems like they are just glossed over lightly and at a rather slow pace. There were some inspiring words narrated over but it still feels like a TV movie rather than one for the big screen hoping to win big awards."
BROOKLYN,6 May 2020,6/10,"I just watched the movie. To be honest I didn't like the story. Lead character is very inconsistent, you don't go out dancing with your friends when you just lost your sister and while your mother is mourning for example. Also immigration process and starting a new life in a new country has very dramatic effects in your life which you won't see any of these in this one.
Fully cloth on sex scene was completely ridiculous. If the director too scared to shot a regular love making scene, it can be skipped rather than having your characters having sex fully clothed for the first time.
They used ""the year's best love story"" quote from rolling stone but believe me even twilight is better love story than this one. It was boring and unnecessary but not a bad movie at the same time."
BROOKLYN,24 December 2015,9/10,"If you are similar to most current movie goers who only like movies that repeatedly show us how horrible we can be as a species, this film is not for you. If you want to see a beautifully filmed, beautifully acted and beautifully scored film that will not confront you with greed, lust and horror every second, then this may be the film for you. My grandfather was an Irish Catholic born in Dublin who came here long before the time in which this film was set. He married the daughter of a Methodist minister who disowned his daughter for joining her life with that of my grandfather. They had many struggles and this film is not about those sad moments. This film is about celebrating possibilities and the loving aspects of human nature. You will walk out of the theater feeling wonderful about who we have the capacity to be. Bravo."
BROOKLYN,9 February 2021,6/10,"Alright the movie was nice. My only problem is, it lacks a satisfying long story.The plot is very simple, she travelled to America. Loved a guy came back to Ireland loved another guy but she decided to stay with the one in America
The end."
BROOKLYN,25 March 2016,,"If you've never seen this movie, or heard about it, don't worry. The story is plain simple: an Irish girl emigrates to New York, and is trying to build her a new life there, but then will be stuck between two guys and so on. Well actually, that's about it.I've waited for ""that moment"" while I was watching this movie. You know, when you hear that a movie is nominated for ""Best Picture"" for the Oscars, you kind of wait it to stand out among other movies came out last year. Unfortunately, as dull as the storyline itself, the movie has overall nothing to offer and brings nothing new to the table. It could have been easily filmed as a TV Movie for BBC or Netflix. The characters and the story are so predictable that you feel like you're watching a Nicholas Sparks adaptation. The worst part is that it is nearly impossible to relate to the main character. I appreciate a lot Saoirse Ronan's work so far but I really can't say that her performance is really outstanding among other Oscar nominees. We get that she feels homesick and can not stand up to bullies and stuff, but the movie is so vacant that you feel like it might be only for the nostalgic feelings that the movie could even get a nomination.Out of 8 nominees in the 2016 Oscars, I would say that Brooklyn had already zero chance at winning and I still don't understand how it got nominated. Maybe there are also some Academy members having Irish roots? I'm sure that nobody around really watched this movie and I'd say, well, just watch the trailer and that's it."
BROOKLYN,17 March 2021,8/10,"When a young Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, she finds a life and navigates in a new land. Wonderful story ."
BROOKLYN,23 June 2021,8/10,"This is one of my favorite movies of Saoirse, cause I believe you can see her soul here. She was very nervous to work on this project, because she was representing her country. And I think she did an amazing job. In my opinion her characters from movies don't vary much, they kinda have the same vibe. (not the earlier ones) but Eilis is really independent one. She really makes you feel her story. It is so nice to see and learn about other countries cultures, through different times. I always loved Irish people and culture, I think they are beautiful and this film represented them gracefully. Struggles of being away from home mixed with young woman's life waves, is very 19th heroine, totally as Brooklyn book author imagined. As an esthetic Movie is very calming, warm, easy to watch, enjoyable. It was such a nice experience. But not very groundbreaking so I'll give it a 8, although I will always love this kinda movies.P. S Italian family was so cliche, I love it. Loved the comic scenes, (Dinner Talks especially) they really made me laugh and smile."
BROOKLYN,3 March 2018,6/10,"I enjoyed the movie as something for light entertainment. I would call it ""gentle drama."" It was a visually appealing film, and I did enjoy that more than the actual script. One thing that is a pet peeve of mine and very, very common in the UK setting movies and television mini-series, is everything is perfect: the clothes, the hair, the immaculate homes, the neatness. Never a hair out of place, or a home-made hairdo or makeup. Supposed to believe that this young woman is not rich, yet her hair, makeup and clothing are perfect. That annoys me so much in UK films. American films are much more able to portray the messiness and imperfection of real life when it comes to clothes, hair and surroundings."
BROOKLYN,2 October 2015,,"Brooklyn is a film about Eilis, who crosses the Atlantic to America in the 1950s. She is a mildly career-motivated young Irish woman who is handed a dream opportunity without ever asking for it. Contrary to what typical immigrant protagonists are like, she neither really works her way up to success nor once finds herself in a life-and-death situation. Rather, this film shows us that a woman of just a usual background can tell an important story that is surprisingly relevant to us all.The main contributor to that surprise is the lead actress, Saoirse Ronan, who plays her role meticulously while also constantly owning the tone of the film. Her delicate and sincere portrayal makes all Eilis's issues, however selfish or insignificant they may seem at first, materialize in your mind, and makes you hope that her pain will somehow ease. Already a one-time Oscar nominee, Ronan reaffirms her acting strength with this exceptional performance. Of all emerging young adult lead actresses, she is likely the most charismatic one in 5 years since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone.From start to finish, Eilis feels just like a girl-next-door. That homey feeling extends to Emory Cohen's Tony, an Italian plumber she meets in the New World. With their small height difference, she almost towers over him in her shoes as they stroll outside, which, helped by their natural chemistry, gives them the authenticity of a couple that you might actually know in real life, as opposed to one of Hollywood's ideal.This film is a remedy for anyone who is losing faith in good filmmaking. It is a splendid reminder that you can tell a great story without resorting to excessive twists and effects. With the remarkable performances from the entire cast, there is hardly a dull minute in the film, and it only gets more interesting towards the end. Speaking of the end, Eilis's tips to a new immigrant she meets at the end still hold very true today. They are not only the best advice that you could ever hear from anyone, but also evidence that America is and has always been the land of opportunity."
BROOKLYN,24 January 2016,,"I haven't seen all of Saoirse Ronan's movies but she was impressive spoiled brat in the Atonement and since How I live now I really count her amongst the most promising actresses. So I watched Brooklyn to see her and she delivered once more. The scene at the end with Nettles Kelly was a powerful performance. Very graceful without any over the top reaching for dramatic effect. This what I loved over all about the film-the intimacy of the story. Just regular people dealing with regular problems, seeking a better future. Even death is not a dramatic exaggeration but a family matter that naturally stirs the fate of the family in a new direction. Also all the supporting cast performed magnificently, especially my favorite Mrs. Weasley, Julie Walters and co-star in HP, Jim Broadbent. But just as another part of the cast, the cinematography made the story look almost magical at moment with great shots of the Irish coast and the lovely choice of colours overall.But there's a thing that I didn't quite like and this is how things unfolded in the love triangle. First of all I didn't find Tony sympathetic at all. But my problem was that the performance of Emory Cohen just didn't make the cut. At times I felt he was trying so hard ""to be Italian"" that I just didn't buy it. Also he was sweet and nice and respectful and all that, but besides he didn't feel to be a great match for the brave young girl that traveled across the world to find her fortune and goes to night classes so she can be an accountant one day. And forcing her to marry him so he can control her to come back, not nice dude, not nice. Especially as I felt she was a bit hesitant about her feelings for him. I know that's a way too modern outtake on a 50' lifestyle, but still I couldn't not notice it. And then comes my biggest issue with the plot- Domhnall Gleeson. I love the guy, he is very interesting and promising actor. So for me he did a great job here as well. I read somewhere that the movie made great work making you hate his character which left me in disbelief. His character was intelligent, well spoken young man who knows there is much more to life than his small town. So pairing him the newly bloomed into women power Eilis was very logical. I recognize that being married and having consummated it, there was not a lot of choice for Eilis but going back, but somehow I felt the story should be- a girl is young and inexperienced as well as homesick, meets a guy who makes her feel better, but then she blooms, she changes and maybe wants something different from life than being attached to an illiterate though good natured man. Instead the plot made an easier choice gossipy little backwards town vs the land of opportunities where the old simply didn't stand a chance. The same small town that was kind enough to offer her job immediately after she came back and everyone were so sweet after the loss of her sister, kind of flat, I should say. So ultimately it was a choice of where she will live and whom she will live to be and we got answer to the easier one.But all that rant out of the way it was exquisite film that I enjoyed and recommend."
BROOKLYN,12 February 2019,7/10,"It's a very simple story, but treated with so much care that you don't get bored. Difficult not to fall in love with Saoirse Ronan. The movie is forgettable, but her acting is not. Really incredible perfomance for such a young actress!"
BROOKLYN,18 December 2015,10/10,"After you watch Brooklyn, you wonder how a story so simple, can be made into such a beautiful & touching film, which makes you appreciate life even more. Its a joy to watch Brooklyn, most of which is conveyed through the eyes of Eilis's character. The deep connection felt by two human beings in a relationship(Tony & Eilis) is something to watch out for, nothing that Hollywood can offer. A natural hug instead of a kiss is a welcome change to reality. If Eilis-h's girlish nature as portrayed by Saoirse is indeed the true nature of an Irish girl, man who wouldn't fall in love with Irish girls :-)"
BROOKLYN,26 December 2016,9/10,"Watching this film actually makes me have the feeling of taking chances, being loved, moving forward and simply believing in yourself. This movie shows different aspect of life, career and love. The cinematography is really beautiful and refreshing, indeed a magnificent scenery of two beautiful cities. I loved how the movie is very modest in terms of story, acting of the actors and how it is suppose to make the viewers feel good about it, especially when the love story occurred. The love story in the movie was purely sweet and just makes you feel in love with the film. The twist in the movie was perfect for it to end with simply realizing how important it is for someone to decide for the life that may lead to someone's happiness. Brooklyn shows that believing in yourself and showing the determination to achieve what you want to achieve will actually put you to the position that you truly deserve to have and enjoy. Even though getting there may put you in doubt and on a decision making process but definitely will make you appreciate yourself's achievement in return. It is a must see film and also a highly recommended one for those people who loves a movie that is unforgettable and so much has to offer that you'll surely going to like it after seeing the film."
BROOKLYN,22 August 2016,8/10,"if a movie can make you cry and make you feel certain things inside then its good enough. No reason not to be a ten because it did its job of being entertaining and touching. Nice incite into the immigration story from an Irish perspective. The actors are good, the story is good. It is kind of straight forward but also kind of realistic without to much exaggeration. The later parts of the movie did feel a bit rushed, it could have been better if there were more scenes and growth in the second half but overall you get the point of the movie and it wraps up nicely. Its better to perhaps watch this movie in the daytime, rather than at night."
BROOKLYN,15 January 2016,10/10,"The story is about a girl who don't know where home is. Eilis is a young Irish girl in Ireland who try hard to find a job after school. Her older sister want for her, after their dad died, a better world. Desperate wrote Eilis older sister a letter to a priest in New York. The journey starts in a new world. Eilis felt lost, far away from her family. Couldn't be happy till she met Tony an Italian boy. At this moment she start fighting homesick and loneliness. This Movie is for everyone, the characters transport emotions and a way of looking, how someone can feel far away from home. Brookyn is a drama Movie who don't have to much of everything. Enjoy it"
BROOKLYN,23 June 2019,10/10,"I didn't think i would be interested in a love story set in the 50's but i was sucked right in and the film sort of chewed me up. they don't make em like this anymore. This film is exceptional. We all knew Saiorse Ronan is a natural born actress but in this one she really shines.
Great production, direction and performances."
BROOKLYN,14 December 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed the film for its escapism & the final feel good factor.
The era it was filmed in was excellently done, the hair, the costumes etc.
I fell in love with the main character, she was pretty & I love her accent, though she might not be as honest & true as we would have hoped or expected.
Talk about the luck of the Irish, she must have found a four leaf clover or something, if the lottery existed in those days, then she would have surely won the jackpot, she was so damn lucky, as everything fell into place for her.
A special mention to Julie Walters who was exceptional as the landlady of the boarding house."
BROOKLYN,17 February 2016,4/10,"My wife and I had decided ""Brooklyn"" was not a 'big screen' movie but when the accolades poured in we thought perhaps it was something out of the box. So we plonked our money down and bought tickets. Disappointment! ""Brooklyn"" is a movie populated with interesting characters, good acting, well constructed scenes and excellent 1950s atmospherics. But  what I can never understand is how a script can make its way through the system to the big screen, getting by a myriad of people who apparently have never read Robert McKee's ""Story"", or having read it failed to understand that one of the basics of story telling is that the central character has to make a decision and take action and the decision must be BIG, must be hard, must be a choice between conflicting ideas of good (not between good and evil which is no decision at all). And the decision must be taken by the central character, not forced upon him/her. What a let down at the end of ""Brooklyn"" where the decision taken by Eilis was a 'no brainer' forced upon her by someone threatening to expose her real situation. Come on script writers! Read McKee. I can't go higher than a 4."
BROOKLYN,20 December 2015,10/10,"I loved this movie! Within the first few minutes I was captivated. It's a beautiful story, and Saoirse is a wonderful lead character. You can feel her intent through her eyes, she doesn't need words for you to understand what she wants and is thinking. Excellent classic film, that will be one for the ""watch again"" list. It is such a nail biting film and the time period captured and true nature of being an immigrant is seen, through the eyes of a very shy and smart Irish girl. The plot is thick with emotions, decisions, wants and needs. The cast is wonderful, all of the people selected for this film, made it feel truly authentic. I'm a 3rd generation Italian and German immigrant, my family can watch this film, and tell me that it is true. The fear of the unknown, the hard work, the strength that you needed to survive and flourish here. In my opinion this is a real love story, with more than one kind of love."
BROOKLYN,23 August 2016,,"Well, I finally saw the movie. It escaped me in 2015 so I thank HBO for putting it on. Now to the crux of the matter. The real heroine of the movie is Ellis's sister Rose. Let's look at the facts Ellis is going nowhere in Ireland. She is is by her standards not pretty like her friend Nancy. She is not interested in the rugby boys who wear the ""blazers"" and oil their hair. So that cuts her out of a potential social life. She is a good pious catholic girl, another strike ""agin"" her . She has a dead end job (working for an old ""witch"", boy I wish I could use another consonant but I will get blacklisted). Her mom (sadly) wants her to stay in Ireland for her mom's benefit by making her the ""dutiful daughter"". She lives in a god forsaken little town, both in size and attitudes which stifles any possible growth or hope for a life. So you can see her current ""life"" really rots!!! But her sister who undoubtedly knows she is terminally ill is not blind to her plight. Again her sister understands all the obstacles confronting Eillis and as such arranges for her to go to America and secure the opportunity of figuratively being reborn.In fact when Eilles is packing she mentions to her sister about the money she has spent on some clothes but the reference is in the fact that she (the sister) would spend any amount to see her happy and thriving in America!!! Also, Eillis had a mini network when she came to America. She has lodgings, a job, and a family friend Priest who gets her into Brooklyn College and pays her tuition for her schooling. She even can go to dances sponsored by the parish to meet boys, which she ultimately does when she meets Tony This touched a nerve in my system. I wish I had a sister or brother or Rabbi who was so altruistic and caring. I wish I was a member of a religious community that set up social functions for me. Sadly, Hebrew Congregations did not do these things well and my dad did not join any Jewish Organizations (because it cost him money) for his son. (me) Unfortunately, I grew up in a ""God forsaken town"" and my life was shaped by all the people that as Ellis said she had forgotten!!!! So, all I can say is her sister is my heroine and the true heroine of the movie and most likely (until I read it the novel)that made me both cry and rejoice for the protagonist !!!!!!!"
BROOKLYN,23 June 2018,10/10,This is a simple story but an amazing film. Saoirse Ronan is magnificent and will be a huge star for years to come. Very enjoyable movie
BROOKLYN,15 March 2019,6/10,"I loved how colourful this movie is, Saoirse Ronan (one of the best actresses of her generation) gave great performance and some frames were shot very well, but i kept asking myself through the movie is ""where is the drama"", everything is going extremely l for the lead character, and the story did not focus enough on the only tragedy that happened during the film, and the final conclusion of the movie (whether she should stay in Ireland or go back to Brooklyn) was not enough for me.
Is this a good movie? Yes, is it special or memorabld? I don't think so.
6.5/10"
BROOKLYN,4 March 2016,6/10,"Brooklyn is mostly a story about immigration. Eilis, the main heroine, travels from Ireland to New York where employment, lodgings, and even night classes are all conveniently arranged by a kindly priest. Though the journey is arduous and homesickness prevails, the path to romance is fairly smooth, and she soon falls into a relationship with a nice, less educated Italian plumber whose love for her could be easily confused for lust. Fate intervenes when Ireland is reintroduced as the new land of opportunity, and Eilis drifts between countries, relationships, and jobs, squandering any apparent initiative on her lackluster love life. Saoirse Ronan infuses Eilis with independence and reason, traits that are stifled by the conventional story. I cared more for her sister than the men she may have loved. Worst of all, the main conflict and resolution come late in the film and have a strange way of undermining Eilis' best qualities. In a picture that makes everything else beautiful, the protagonist remains somewhat tainted in the end by her own indecisiveness.Rating based on five factors, each worth up to two points: Sound: 1; Acting/Characterization: 2; Script: 1; Visuals: 1; Concept: 1Total: 6"
BROOKLYN,23 October 2019,6/10,"As an Italian I can say that the Italians in this film don't look at all Italian, especially Ronan's love interest.
Scrolling the cast they haven't got Italian surnames.
One little kid has an Italian surname, he uses Italian gestures but not in the right way.
They drink milk at the table. No Italian would ever dream of drinking milk at the table.
My point is that if you get Irish (or British) actors to play the Irish you might as well get Italian-Americans to play the Italians. If you do things do them right..."
BROOKLYN,4 September 2016,,"Thank you, a John Crowley for bringing this film to life. There's only a small number of filmmakers who have enough clout to make a non star driven, period piece film in this day in age of comic fanfare. And this hits the mark. It's simple and beautiful, and feels so amazing the tic and genuine. I've watched it six times now ..... And it has a magic quality that really makes me love this film in a way that made me fall in love with films so long ago.Terrific performances throughout. Beautiful production design. Great story telling. Just refreshing to see talented filmmakers and actresses/actors working with good and well crafted scripts. And, again, Crowley, the Captain, thank you. I will pay to see whatever you come out with next."
BROOKLYN,14 May 2016,8/10,"Brooklyn tells the touching love story of an Irish immigrant, Ellis Lacey, as she explores a new world, and leaves behind an old. After moving to Brooklyn, Ellis at first feels alone, and struggles to find happiness in her new life. She struggles until she meets Tony, an Italian boy who she falls in love with after meeting at a dance. The story itself is moving and heartfelt, with a very solid script to help drive home the emotions. The music and acting came together to create a film that not only is immersing, it feels real. Saoirse Ronan does a particularly spectacular job, by making the lead character very relate- able and adorable. Emory Cohen plays opposite her, as the sometimes awkward but very likable Tony, and he performs in a way that compliments the two leads as a couple while highlighting how their differences in character make them stronger together. The camera work was my only complaint, some shots felt somewhat unimportant or irrelevant, but overall this was a very excellent and memorable film."
BROOKLYN,13 March 2016,7/10,"An excellent time-piece portraying the difficulties faced when emigrating to a new land. The protagonist is torn between two commitments: her duty to her homeland and family, and her duty to her aspirations in the new world. Or rather, between a glorious past and a glorious future; an old village and a grand metropolis. Her choice ultimately resembles the ones our great-grandparents made upon arriving on these shores; they risked everything for opportunity and personal gain. For that reason the setting is fascinating. The characters could easily be our own family. Yet, though it only takes place less than 100 years ago it may as well have been a thousand. The stark difference of culture, customs, and technology is poignant throughout the film. And yet we see a world where our own culture (American culture) is the strange one. The 'normal' is Irish or Italian. And therefore we realize the line between us and modern day immigrants is not as wide as we thought. A very fitting film considering our present day circumstances in global politics. Maybe we should not fear immigrants? After all, are they much different from our grandparents?"
BROOKLYN,27 September 2016,8/10,"This movie is like one of the million movies out there who tries to make a simple yet original story without failing it. I love the characters, I love how Saoirse Ronan portrayed her character really well and you can see all the actors, even the supporting one are really really talented. And can we talk about the relationships in the story, so pure, innocent and cute at the same time. However, I wish that there were more soundtracks put in the film and my most concerned thing is the filter. I mean, the pictures were great but they had to add some final touches to make it looked like the film was originated at the time of the story. And if you noticed, sometimes the cameras moved on some scenes and it made me a bit annoyed. But apart of all that, I think this movie deserved awards. Couldn't agree more"
BROOKLYN,13 August 2016,3/10,"Unspeakably dull romance about a somewhat unpleasant, rather smug and judgmental Mary Sue. Basically everyone seems to find Ellis wonderful, falls all over themselves to help her or literally falls in love with her....and given how she generally seems slightly bitchy (in some cases, inexplicably so, like with the ""she's awful"" comment about the new girl, to whom Ellis had been the awful one)----to say nothing of, as a newlywed, she proceeds to flirt shamelessly with another man and ignore her poor husband's letters. That's an emotional affair and made me feel very sorry for both men.T be honest, I liked ""evil"" Miss Kelly better than anyone else----at least, she called Ellis on her lies. Though, naturally, Ellis got all sanctimonious about it.I'd probably give it one star, except the acting was good."
BROOKLYN,7 April 2018,7/10,"Brooklyn is the story of Eilis, a young Irish woman crossing to 1950s America to start the life she couldn't find in Ireland. At first overwhelmed, she soon finds her feet and the love of her life until tragedy and an unexpected match leaves her torn between her lives in Brooklyn and Ireland.The focus of the movie is place strongly on Eilis and her personal struggles; her sense of loneliness and vulnerability being homed in on by the director in an effort to elicit an emotional response, the beautiful musical score went a long way ensuring this hit the mark most times (though the emotion of the opening scenes and some in the third act felt very contrived). The introverted personality that we follow for the opening of the movie made for an uninteresting protagonist, aimlessly plodding along until she finds love in the form of an Italian plumber (yes, really...no, his name isn't Mario).However, the slow start is soon made up for. Set in an idyllic alternate Brooklyn adhering to the stereotypical 'American Dream' holding a quietly romantic tone throughout (as dictated by lead Saoirse Ronan) as the couple fall in love in the most unabashedly cheesy but endearing way. It didn't feel like anything new but it did feel very well done, in large part to the charming performances of Ronan and Cohen throughout.Following this, the movie began to outstay its welcome, the effect lack of a fleshed out secondary cast were felt and my attention would waver a bit as the third act commenced, suffering from the same forced emotion of the opening scenes of the movie. While the dichotomy of Eilis' identity was well-established, the film was taken over by an oppressively overly-sentimental tone which made me feel detached from the movie rather than investing me deeper. Brooklyn is a slow-burning love story and a unique immigrant story centred on the identity crisis of Eilis, though it suffers from some drawbacks; most notably a lackluster secondary cast and contrived attempts at sentimentality in places. Despite this, it's still something I'd recommend for its lovable protagonists (Ronan and Cohen) and their winning performances."
BROOKLYN,31 January 2016,9/10,"I would've given it a 10 but one part of the film made no sense to me. When Eilis returns to Ireland, why did she keep her relationship to her American man such a well-guarded secret?If anybody can explain this, i'd appreciate it because i did not read the book.Nevertheless, i thoroughly enjoyed this moving film with its many themes of loves and immigration. My parents are immigrants so this strikes a chord with me.Go see this wonderful film and take a date, it's a classic romance.This film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar btw.The character's name, Eilis is pronounced ""Ay-lish"".Underrated part of the film is the music, particularly the acapella singing at the Irish American feast."
BROOKLYN,27 November 2015,6/10,"I saw this film earlier today, and it is already slipping from my memory. There were a few scenes I liked, but overall it is somewhat forgettable. A fair number of scenes were not very satisfying, and the sum was perhaps even less than the parts. Saoirse Ronan has a nice screen presence and seems to be quite talented. Actually I liked the casting in general; It was the writing and maybe the editing that were less impressive. The attempts to trigger emotional response felt forced most of the time. After one such dramatic peak, a number of people in the audience gasped, like a sorrowful equivalent of a laugh-track. Amanda and I looked at each other and laughed quietly."
BROOKLYN,3 March 2016,6/10,"I went to see this film with high hopes. Despite being a male I have always enjoyed romance in movies. When it's done well (see ""Her"", ""The Titanic"", ""Silver Linings Playbook"", ""Punch-Drunk Love""). When I say ""well"", I mean that it is not a by-the- numbers, cliché filled, boy-meets-girl story in which you know how it will end the second the movie begins. This, unfortunately, is exactly that.I will not spoil anything, but even if I did, I wouldn't be spoiling anything you couldn't have already figured out ten minutes into the movie. The movie follows an Irish immigrant to Brooklyn, New York, in search of money and opportunity. It is here that she meets a boyishly handsome Italian man at a dance. You already know how this movie ends, don't you?My issue with this film is not even in its clichéd premise or story, although there's a lot to complain about there. My main issue is its execution. There is not a single example of interesting directing or cinematography. There is not a single example of an interesting and well written character. There is nothing special about this movie in any way.To sum it up, Brooklyn is a movie you've seen a thousand times before, with no defining features or surprises. It is an extremely generic film, and I will never fully understand how it came to be nominated for best picture."
BROOKLYN,21 December 2016,9/10,"Just watched this fabulous film....don't usually write reviews but this time I felt driven to. I'm not going to describe this film in any way, all I can say is watch it...and if you have a heart you will love this beautiful and poignant story. Some of the reviews I've seen have been dismissive and uncomplimentary; OK, fair enough, because all of us have a right to our opinion...But this is exactly why I was compelled to add my 'tuppence worth'. This is a terrific piece of cinema, a heart-rending story but one with ultimate hope and optimism; it exemplifies precisely what good film-making and cinema should be all about. I loved it!"
BROOKLYN,15 August 2019,7/10,"Just think about Eilis's mother, how is she gonna live the rest of her life and how's she gonna bear the neighbourhoodEilis made too many mistakes.Should have never married Tony just before leaving. She was having sex and getting married in NYC while her sister's funeral was going on in Ireland. She didn't think once about her mother before making the decision.Then she didn't tell her mother about the marriage staright away after reaching Ireland.Then she started ignoring Tony and romancing Jim despite being in a wedlock.Then she made the final decision in desperation and out of emotions after Miss Kelly told her about the letter. She should have bombed the bad out of Miss Kelly for interfering in her personal affairs.All in all, I would say Eilis wasn't a wise girl and that she made many selfish decisions. On the other hand, her big sister was a true role-model. The movie seemed very real.... very close to our real social behaviours..."
BROOKLYN,1 December 2015,6/10,"A wonderful movie experience in the telling of the story of a young women discovering herself and her place in the world. Remarkable for her not being dependent on men or her elder female relatives to define what she wants out of her life. It was one of those movies you want to go on and on telling their story. So want to give this movie a ten but can't because of one thing. If you have not seen the movie, perhaps you should stop reading as I do not want to prejudice your viewing ahead of time.****** ********* ********** ******* ********** ********* ***********The director and/or cinematographer have chosen to repeatedly use a sort of rolling motion when filming characters at medium distance from the camera. This occurs quite often during dialogue among characters. Unfortunately once I noticed it I could not stop seeing it. I'm of the opinion that technique used in a movie should never get in the way of immersion into the film especially for those watching in a theater setting. My sole exception are those beautifully framed ""art"" shots that make you say ""Wow!"" while watching.Having noticed it early on in the movie, I had plenty of time to think about whether the motion was intended to enhance the moment or pass on subliminal expression/emotion to the viewer. Then I thought it was to add some sort of realism in experiencing the characters' conversation. However, my recall of talking or watching others talk does not include a sort of ""at sea"" rolling motion so that's not it.Very glad I went but wish I could have totally enjoyed it. Oh well."
BROOKLYN,21 November 2015,7/10,"The reviewer who said the film is in a ""sea of Hollywood schlock"" is so right. The novel is so much better and has so much more depth. The words in the novel are crafted cleanly and sparingly to give us Eilis' thoughts. I found the Hollywood clichés in the writing of the screenplay a little too over the top. I wouldn't have been surprised if a charming Lephrechaun had jumped out of a box of ""Lucky Charms"" at their table. The film's saving graces are the extreme close-ups on the eyes and face of the lead actress, which are compelling and the art direction and lighting. The cinematographer and art director captured the beauty of the Northern light and perfect period detail in the interiors, such as delicate, old teapots and the quiet calm of having tea with her mother in her old home-- this is what good filmmaking is about- stunning light and truthful visuals."
BROOKLYN,8 August 2016,10/10,"I watched Brooklyn with one of the biggest grins I've ever experienced. What a beautiful and heart warming tale of immigration and love, and the struggles that accompany them. Rich cinematography brings alive the era and the characters, great dialogue bounces perfectly (and the dinner scenes gave me some of the best laughs I've had in a while.) Ronan's performance is fantastic and heart wrenching, her eyes alone can tell so much. I would personally say that nearly everything here is on point, it's everything I expected to get from it and more. I loved the vibrant outfits, the lovely score, and the use of letters.I loved this. It is definitely going up there with the rest of my beloved favourites. I recommend this very heavily to anyone looking to smile, to shed a few tears, and to just have an enjoyable experience."
BROOKLYN,25 December 2018,8/10,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. I didn't mind that the lead character didn't face many challenges and that overall everyone around her was kind as other reviewers have commented. I didn't even mind that the main protagonist, her ex-employer in Ireland was hardly a protagonist at all.
But what niggled at me in the latter half of the movie was the Main character's suddenly spineless uncharacteristic slippery slope into having an emotional affair with another man and toying with his emotions and ignoring her husbands letters when they had gone to such great lengths to build her character in the beginning as one of such fine moral standing, kindness and gentleness. Even more so that the slippery slope was a steep one taking place less than a full month after she had just been married in Brooklyn? That part of the storyline felt weak and uncomfortable.
That said, visually the movie was beautiful, most of the characters were likeable and it was a nice way to while away 90 minutes of an afternoon."
BROOKLYN,18 February 2016,8/10,"I watched this movie because of the several Oscar nomination it have, and I have to say that I'm not disappointed. Brooklyn can be a slow movie, but for me it was pretty fast-passing and entertaining. I know that the immigrants going for the American dream is something topic in films, but I haven't seen a lot of movies about it, so for me it was all new and beautiful. I really like the performances. I was prejuicious and I thought that the main actress wouldn't do a good job (despite of being nominated for best actress) because she also was also the character in The Host (I liked that movie, but it was cheesy). But oh-my-goodness her portraying of Eilisie was fantastic; she turned an insipid and boring character in something really... lets say artistic. The male character in this movie was very sweet and beautiful and everything, but I just couldn't stand all the insta-love here. Just don't. I don't know why but I wasn't able to believe in the romance on Brooklyn.Overall, I loved the final message of the immigration and how strong the main character turned out to be."
BROOKLYN,20 May 2016,10/10,"Brooklyn (2015) 1 hr. 51 min.Ellis Island has been the place where millions of people from the early to mid-1900's have welcomed many immigrants from all over the world in particular Italy and Ireland and the main character of this story is an immigrant from Ireland, who moves to America for a better life for herself with little prospects for the future because of lacking in real economic substance in her home country. Her name is Ellis (Soraise Ronan) who works at a local shop only once and week and lives with her sister and Mother. Her future prospects look dim until a Priest Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), who is visiting from America, offers her money to stay at boarding house and she gets a job at a very ritzy department store in Brooklyn (hence the title). She goes to Brooklyn and stays with a woman who runs the boarding house (Julie Walters) and a couple of giddy tenants who are older but are not as sensible and as responsible as Ellis is. The Walters character, offers Ellis to stay in a roomy basement. Ellis has a wonderful job and has a roof over her head but she is homesick and is quite depressed of her predicament, until one day at a dance she meets a charming and sincere Italian named Tony (Emroy Cohen) whom approaches her and they begin a sweet romance that is built of respect, attraction and hopefulness of the future. They are both attracted to each other and one of the best things about the movie, is how Ellis initiates the relationship when she first tells him that she loves him is very straightforward, but sweet and sincere way. One scene that also stands out, is when Ellis's fellow tenants at the boarding house, teach her how to twirl spaghetti, when Tony invites Ellis to meet his family, which leads to a funny scene where Tony's 8 year old brother reams off negative Irish stereotypes that they cannot be trusted, taking Ellis aback and how Ronan handles these moments is the greatness of movie acting. Problems arise with Ellis when her sister Mary dies unexpectedly and returns to Ireland where her Mother and Meddlesome towns' folk try to persuade Ellis to stay by introducing a friend of the family to start a courtship with Ellis. She now has to decide to either stay in Ireland or return to Brooklyn and start a new life with Tony.What is refreshing about the movie is the main character Ellis, is not a dysfunctional person. She is not an alcoholic, promiscuous, mentally unstable is a well-rounded and responsible young woman who is nonetheless, a very interesting character because she is starting a new life with optimistic dreams and possibilities of the future. She is a hard worker who is determine to find love and have a better life for herself. But when she is tested to go back to Ireland to be with her mother, who is lonely after Ellis's sister death. Ellis faces a serious dilemma of what is more important. To stay with a mother who has no one to confide in or with Tony who she could build a family and pursue their quest for the American dream. The resolution is not as simple as it appears, because family heritage, tradition and loyalty come into play. To decide between these two elements, is dealt with in a thoughtful and truthful way. Moreover, how dealing with family dynamics can be stressful to a daughter or son that can be riddled by guilt. Lastly, the movie asks the audience, what the best decision Ellis must make. What is more important thing in life? Family and tradition or loyalty to a man that brings her much needed love, stability and comfort. Soraise Ronan is wonderful in the lead role. She witty, intelligent, loyal young woman and you're rooting for to make it in America and to find true happiness and Ronan and Cohen have great chemistry as the young lovers. Julie Walters is very funny as the Manager of the boarding house where Ellis stays in."
BROOKLYN,22 February 2016,8/10,"Yes this film has flaws and it's not the greatest film ever made, but it's an incredibly emotion packed movie. I won't go into details about the story and the qualities, others have done it at length. I just want to say that it is one of the very few instances where the emotion does not really come from the story but from the characters. And specifically from Saoirse Ronan. This girl comes from another planet. What she is able to convey in this film is just incredible. The feelings, the pain, the joy, the doubts, the anger, I can't remember this quality of acting in a long long time. And I'm still wondering : ""is she really an actress ?"". I don't think so, the word has not been invented yet for what she is. It's beyond acting and maybe beyond perfection. You have to see this film to believe it."
BROOKLYN,23 December 2015,3/10,"Colm Toibin is a great writer. Nick Hornby is not. I have enjoyed some of C.T.'s novels a great deal (In fact ""The Heather Blazing"" is a favorite of mine.) I like his genteel style in such work. The performances here are fine, or better than fine; it looks lovely: the color palette, the costumes, the scenes and scenery all make for a fine backdrop. Where it fails, and it is a major failing, is that it says nothing of any real worth about the migrant experience. Eilis (Saoirise Ronan) is shipped off to NYC through the assistance of her thoughtful sister and a kindly priest. (In a good performance by Jim Broadbent as Father Flood.) Up until an easily predicted plot development the difficulties faced by our heroine are a bout of seasickness, the need for 30 seconds training in her new job as a shop assistant, and a touch of homesickness. While I'm happy to see women succeed, there would have been far more dirt under the fingernails of all of these women. Apart from the minor matter of losing her virginity, Eilis could indeed be the sainted mother of God. It all suffers from Nick Hornby blandness. Everything he touches turns to bland. My advice: stay away from his cooking and, more importantly, his ""creative"" projects. This is not meant to be an art house atmospheric enigma, nor is it, but it fails to involve solely because of a threadbare plot that avoids detailing the threadbare aspects of lives led by women who were, in reality, the working poor."
BROOKLYN,17 December 2015,,"I must confess being a bit of a sucker for the 50s, especially America. I recently saw the equally beautiful Carol (Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara) also set during the 50s and both films share a similar innocent suppressed vibe. And, it must be said, wonderfully elegant fashions.Sixty years ago, for anyone to travel, with their family, half way across the world in search of a better life, was and still is a significant undertaking, but for a woman to do that on her own, took immense courage and fortitude.The Brooklyn story is very simply told, not requiring any contrivances to keep things ""interesting"". It's this purity of focus that allows the audience to be drawn in to the world of Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) as she experiences life in all its messiness and beauty.Brooklyn is a film that, similar to Carol, relies as much on what isn't said as what is and with Saoirse Ronan's piercing eyes, a silent look can melt hearts.Strong female lead roles are still a depressing scarcity and it's wonderful to find a film that succeeds because it ""is"" from a woman's perspective.If you are jaded by convoluted romantic story lines and token female characters I urge you to give Brooklyn a watch."
BROOKLYN,17 February 2016,5/10,"Pyrite, that's exactly what this film should've been called. Both the book from Irish writer Colm Tóibín and the film are ingloriously flat and plain. The tale is lost, it is not about a generation or the History of immigration in Ireland, the narrative is weak and gets lost. It is about young Eilis, a young girl with no power of decision, no opinion, no move throughout the book... In the film, the director tried to save it a little bit. The director hid Eilis flaw's (which could be explored both by the writer and the director to compose a good story, I am not defending perfection) in order to make people empathize with her. Truth is: the book is so lame the director had to improvise. And then, because he had no working material, she is light and empty and superfluous, in both supports.What I consider to be important: there are many characters in Literature and cinema that are absolutely hateful. But not Eilis. She is so bad depicted that... you never really believe she exits. She never leaves the sketches of these artists and never becomes alive. So to me it is all fake, both book and film. They kept reminding me ""is doesn't feel real because it isn't real, it's a circus"".And this is my opinion. I won't forget this so soon because it is an artistic fraud. I hope it doesn't get any awards, or I won't be able to trust the better judgement of the Academy ever again."
BROOKLYN,21 January 2016,6/10,"If there's a scene to point out the target audience of this film, it's when our lady Eilis goes to a park alone and sits in front of a lake and reads a letter with no sad information and cries anyway.It's about Irish immigrants going to New York. Now, as a quarter Irish, I don't care. I imagine if you're full Irish this is the story your grandmother tried to tell you and you ignored her, rightfully so.This is the tale of the birth of the Brooklyn hipster. A girl falls in love in America. After Prettyface Mick returns to Ireland, she forgot about the beautiful Irish countryside and begins to fall in love with someone there. These are the interesting aspects of the movie where the forces of family and familiarity and community pull at your heartstrings and threaten to mold you into a life by their design. It's the dichotomy of city life versus the simpletons. The simple life is very seductive, but relatively complacent. At some point a simpleton says something mean and our protagonist is all, now I remember how this place is.What I don't like is when it comes to the country or the city, the movie makes a definite decision of which one it prefers. Progress isn't just one route. You can always go back, or you can change your mind. The movie doesn't make this distinction."
BROOKLYN,18 February 2016,6/10,"In all honesty, this is a good movie. I mean, it was well put together, it had an OK story and I'll even say that I did enjoy some of it. But the fact of the matter is that objectively Brooklyn is nothing special. The story has been told, the characters have existed and the relationships have been played out. It's a fine movie that I enjoyed well enough but I simply don't understand the love for it. With multiple nominations (Damn, I'm discussing it again) Brooklyn really does steal the show from other – more deserving titles. But hey, film taste is a matter of opinion Let me explain mine. Let me start off by saying that this movie is basically what you expect. Seen the posters? Seen the trailer? You know what this is. It's not a big surprise and it won't blow you away. If you're into it, you're into it If you're not, you're not. So considering this I will clearly state that this movie was not made for people like me. I probably don't quite hit that demographic in the slightest. But as I said, film is subjective, And I saw it anyway. As a consistent period piece, the film follows a young woman from Ireland as she makes her move to the bigger and busier city of Brooklyn. (Duh) The contrast between settings and lifestyles of 1950s Ireland and America is heavily implied and exposed throughout the film, and this is where Brooklyn succeeds. The simplicity and familiarity yet boringness and lack of opportunity at home compared to the intimidation of a big new city filled with many new faces is quite a staggering difference. From the colour palette on screen to the general aesthetic, Brooklyn visually demonstrations an obvious comparison. We see this through the eyes of our protagonist; Eilis. Paired up with the pressure of new responsibilities and a lack of experience, Eilis is in the middle of a relatable situation. We've all been 'The new guy,' in one way or another and the film presents this in a realistic way; We feel what she feels, as she learns to live this new life style and deals with life's general hurdles. The character development of Eilis is clear and realistic, and we grow with her throughout the film.Another strong suit of this film is the relationship between Eilis and her new found boyfriend Tony. Tony is easily the most likable character in the film (In a film full of lifeless human-mannequins) He's charming, ambitious and clearly loyal. In the end however, Tony truly represents the city of Brooklyn to Eilis and thus to us. We do root for these characters, however the drama which effects them is completely blown out of proportion and comes off as totally exaggerated. Tony and Eilis however, are just about the only interesting characters in the film. Everybody else feels as if they're not really people living their own lives but these personality-less beings that weave in and out of the story. Even Domhnall Gleeson's (Who I'm recently a fan of) character is boring. We pretend as an audience to care about the people Eilis cares about, but in the end these people are side characters that we never really get to know; They don't really stand out and don't have much to do. They're dreary and sometimes downright unlikable despite the actors' best efforts. The acting in the film is something to pay attention to if anything, it's at times rather melodramatic and 'soap opera-y' however mostly keeps low-key and realistic. There are not too many cliché 'Oscar worthy' moments here, but rather the film managed to keep restraint and never went over the top in terms of acting. Themes of 'leaving the nest,' and being a young adult can be a relatable story, and it's here where the film keeps most interesting. I enjoyed seeing Saoirse Ronan play an awkward inexperienced young person in almost comedic fashion as well as her interactions with Emory Cohen's (I didn't have to google that or anything) character Tony. In this way, the film could often at times be surprisingly funny. Moments of comedy are hidden between the cracks of the films mechanical like drama. However, the film fails to really be about anything - Not much happens in Brooklyn and there's not much beyond that to say about it. This is where the film falls hardest. We witness characters speaking to each other, going from point A to point B scene after scene. Perhaps stories such as this are better left in written form, because as a film, Brooklyn is a bit of an eventless drought. The film is extremely slow, and in the end mostly uneventful. It comes off as a bit pretentious. This isn't a movie strictly for intellectuals and it's not a movie that will be all that remembered as a classic. It's an alright movie though, that you may or may not enjoy, may or may not see in cinemas and may or may not care about at all. It's in no way terrible, but also doesn't come close to amazing either. It's enjoyable enough to give it a watch if you're interested and even surprisingly funny and relatable. 6.5/10"
BROOKLYN,17 February 2016,8/10,"Sweet, romantic and heavily laden with longing, this little film has all the ingredients of a date night movie. The camera loves Ms. Ronan, and the Brooklynesque scenery behind her is meticulously dressed considering this movie was shot a long way from NYC. It's not an epic, and I don't know why it would be nominated for an Oscar were it not for the ten nominee slots the Academy has to fill every year. But it is a gentle and pleasant tale that leaves the audience feeling uplifted, something we can't say about a lot of the big movies this year. On the negative side, do we need another movie about a woman whose entire existence seems to revolve around finding a man? There are thousands of stories to tell about women of true accomplishment. And was Brooklyn really an all-white borough back then? Just some quibbles with a movie I walked away from smiling, and holding hands with my wife."
BROOKLYN,20 February 2016,4/10,"The movie doesn't look like 50s, both cars and Brooklyn, Ireland, dancing, poverty, motivation, costumes, atmosphere itself. Sometimes it looks like 30s, sometimes 60s. Poor Ireland turns into blooming country for a few months. The plot is very nice, wide space for creativity, but... It looks like authors never felt need nor duty nor passion. Life of wax people with synthetic problems and feelings. The movie pretends to be a human story, but it is far away from real life, real people. False feeling. It looks like authors read no book only comics, never fell in love, they can make love only. Ultimately, poor realization strangled nice plot. As for me, of course. You eager in anticipation with plot for all the movie but the small mistakes and disappointments then and again spoil your impression, but you calm yourself down, OK, it's just a small lapse, let's enjoy it... I'm surprised the movie was nominated, it is not Cinema, it's just a piece of pop-culture, cliché, comics."
BROOKLYN,8 January 2017,9/10,"This is such a heart-warming movie! It does not display any of the fast pace often used in Hollywood movies. The plot unfolds slowly, allowing the watcher to share the protagonists' emotions. Myself not being an English native speaker, I enjoyed the different kids of accents (all very easy to understand!) used in the movie. Also, I always enjoy historical insights into entering the US (like Ellis Island) which is also very shortly covered in the movie. Also, the actors' immense beautiful acting needs to be praised! There is surely no overacting, no out-crying drama or over-joyous happiness like in a fairy tale. The movie displays an emotional range one might encounter in everyday life - which I found very intriguing.Since I do not want to spoil the movie, I can only recommend it! I'm wondering wondering whether a male audience would enjoy this film as much because the main protagonist is a woman. Nevertheless, it's a delight to watch!"
BROOKLYN,3 April 2020,6/10,"I've always put off watching this film - perhaps it's timing. It seems there are far too many movies and shows which somehow glorify (or at least vindicate) having affairs and I feared this would be much the same so avoided it. I was half right. It is a love story, beautifully acted, which left me shouting at my tele on more than one occasion questioning what will happen all the way through. Are the people really this nice? Do they have ulterior motives? Will she go back to the man who very clearly loves her? (gosh, I hope so!). It's enjoyable enough but have to say, I'm not sure it was worth the hysteria."
BROOKLYN,11 August 2019,9/10,"If you like heartwarming feelgood Movies then you should watch this. It has like other mentioned before some Hallmark flair to it. So if you like Hallmark Movies, you sure would love this Movie.The Acting is very good and the story is rather nice and calm.Not 10 Stars because there are definitely better Movies out there, but you can see and feel why it has been nominated for 3 Academy Awards."
BROOKLYN,25 October 2019,5/10,"I hated the carachter, I couldn't accept her behaviours. She was never sure about loving tony. It seemed like it's the best chance for her at that time then why not?
This appears when she met Jem, she get confused that she doesn't reply Tony's messages and starts to give Jem promises while she is already married!
Then she simply leave saying that she is married.
I couldn't accept such action. If someone is not sure about his decisions, feelings, or himself, he must never give a promise to someone else..
The other people also have feelings and this is called ""messing up""."
BROOKLYN,25 December 2020,10/10,"What a beautiful and relatable film, I can relate to it as a relatively young person (26) who has experienced moving to and living in a new country. Whilst the film is set in the 50's, in an era where communication was not as instant as it is today, it speaks of the raw emotions, pain, joy and journey of growth that one goes through when moving to a new place. Eilis - Saoirse Ronan's acting speaks for itself. It is moving and utterly beautiful. I am in awe of the whole movie. It also made me feel and understand what it was like for my parents and other immigrants to move to a new country when letter writing and telephone calls were the main mode of communication, when travel was less frequent and distances were greater, and begin to understand what it must have been like for them to leave lives, parents and families behind to begin a new life in a country they would grow to call home. I love this movie and I will watch it again."
BROOKLYN,30 September 2018,5/10,"All women in this film are aggressive. No emphathy for anyone. No good dialogs, nor story, not credible."
BROOKLYN,1 November 2015,8/10,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to a preview of Brooklyn last week, and in a rare change from the normal routine, I went into a film knowing absolutely nothing about it. It was such a full house, that I ended up staring up at the screen from well outside my usual comfort zone at an awkward angle, too close to the screen, and away from my girlfriend which wasn't a great start, but once the film started I was quickly caught up in the magnificence of Saoirse Ronan's performance and forgot about any of those minor gripes.Ronan owned this film, from first to last. The storyline itself is a somewhat thin and a follows a well-trodden path but Ronan gives it such heft, and brings the intensity of her character's experience and development full force such that any deficiencies of the story seem inconsequential. It was only after leaving the screening that I really looked back at some of the plot points and realised how contrived it had been in places, but for the time I was watching it, I was simply living it through the potency of the acting. Ronan was brilliant in this, and I struggle to think of any recent performances that can match this for the confidence and sure-footedness that she showed. I think she's in with a good shout for an award or two for this role.It's worth mentioning Julie Waters as well, who reliably entertains and impresses in all she does. Between her and Saoirse Ronan, they made sure that Brooklyn passed the 6 laugh test – and also the 6 cry test. I laughed, and cried, and laughed as I was crying, and cried as I was laughing pretty much throughout the whole film. A thoroughly enjoyable film, where the central performance takes the audience on an engrossing and emotional trip through an otherwise somewhat slight storyline."
BROOKLYN,14 December 2015,9/10,"Brooklyn is the story of a young Irish immigrant in the 1950's who moves across the ocean to Brooklyn, NY in search of a better life at the behest of her sister.Saoirse Ronan (of The Lovely Bones and Hanna fame) plays Eilis, an intelligent and relatively ambitious young woman who wants for more than her uneventful life in her home country of Ireland. Her sister, through oversees connections, secures Eilis a visa and urges her to take the opportunity, even though it means leaving her family behind and saddling her sister with the responsibility of caring for their aging mother.The filmmakers succeed in making Eilis instantly sympathetic, creating an atmosphere for Ronan to further engross audiences with her inherently endearing nature. She seamlessly glides through her performance as Eilis struggles through her first New York winter terribly homesick, and eventually comes to terms with her new reality. She's helped along on that journey by the charming Tony (Emory Cohen), who falls head over heels in love with her the moment that they first lock eyes. With the help of Tony and with her roommates as a support staff, Eilis she is able to make a life for herself in Brooklyn and keep the pangs of homesickness at bay.Special attention is paid to Eilis' character development, something that as a viewer, I really appreciate. 30 minutes into the film I felt like I knew Eilis personally, like I was a guest at the diner table. Tragedy strikes back home in Ireland and halts her new found happiness. She's forced to examine her direction in life and furthermore, evaluate her choices.The film's greatest accomplishment is the connection it fosters between the characters and then extends to the audience. Every member of the cast pulls their weight, but Ronan carries Brooklyn in her eyes, which she uses to display a plethora of emotional reactions that not only provide insight into Eilis as a character, but move the story forward as well. I wouldn't be surprised to see her name on the Oscar ballot this year.Brooklyn is without a doubt my favorite love story of the year. You will laugh, you will cry, but you'll ultimately leave the theater with a smile on your face."
BROOKLYN,25 August 2016,9/10,"A beautiful and moving film. A love story that draws you in, and is told so well that you care about the characters almost immediately. The photography and the close-ups are really beautiful, and the camera loves Saoirse Ronan. She leaves Ireland and she is off to America, (Brooklyn). Her trip to America is shot so economically, yet powerfully, you could feel what it must have been like on that Ocean Liner. Homesick and missing her widowed Mum and Sister she makes a home for herself in Brooklyn. But will she stay in Brooklyn? The cast is amazing, Julie Waters, Jessica Pare, and Jim Broadbent, to mention a few. The wardrobe was authentic , and the soft warm colors seemed to give this film a dreamlike feeling. But In the end it was all about Saoirse, she carried this film, there was never a false moment. When she was homesick, you knew it, you could feel it. I love ""BROOKLYN""."
BROOKLYN,26 July 2019,1/10,So looking forward to this movie but goodness me so superficial and complete lack of depth of characters. You cared about no one really and the final scene you hoped a car would cause some drama but no. The scene of of Frankie's 'song' and young Freddie's contribution shone the only light in this movie. The interesting Australian film Ladies in Black handled similar issues with so much more panache and care. Sadly awful.
BROOKLYN,2 February 2016,6/10,"I have to say it from the start : it's not a bad movie. But this movie does not have an original idea. The main story was present in the history of movies in many, many forms. It's not a true candidate for the best picture. By far i think mad max should win this category but the actress though has done her job. For her tasteless,rushed role she made it. I don't know,maybe i'm too rough with these movies, but it seems that this year it's a weak one when when we look at Hollywood production. Brooklyn it's just another production which if it wasn't nominated for Oscars have had gone unseen by most of the people around world. It's sad but true... another mediocrity has been nominated for the grand prize ! Peace out !"
BROOKLYN,29 April 2018,10/10,"I keep watching it over and over again. I find the characters so intriguing and yet so secretive that I need to keep watching it to try and learn more about them. I find the character of Tony, played by Emory Cohen, just perfectly acted."
BROOKLYN,10 November 2016,8/10,"I was first introduced to Saoirse Ronan when I saw the movie Atonement. Back then I saw a young actress who had a promising career ready for her. Brooklyn in so many ways is a story of my life as a former immigrant to this country, so in so many ways I felt a strong sense of nostalgia come over me while watching the movie. I am sure that other former immigrants or those who had to travel to a different country for a while for whatever reason, who have seen this movie can fully relate to the kind of home sickness that overcomes you when you are away from home.The story plot of the movie is simple and pleasant. Although I enjoy intense drama's there are times where I don't mind a more lighthearted kind of drama. So to me the acting by all of the actors was superb. I am most certainly looking forward to seeing what other works Jessica Pare is in as of the fact that this is the first time I am acquainted with her acting in this movie. I think that she did a wonderful job playing the role of Miss. Fortini. The cinematography was also wonderfully done. I enjoyed seeing the many beautiful scenes of Ireland, a country that is on my list of places I'd love to tour one day.I am not so sure what people would find as a ""spoiler"". I am never sure of that when I talk about movies. So I hope that I did not give anything away that would disappoint someone, as that is not what I like to do anyway. I checked the spoiler checkbox just in case for that reason. If you enjoy a good simple, not so intense, kind of drama then I highly recommend giving this movie a try."
BROOKLYN,25 February 2016,9/10,"A simple , yet unique story is portrayed in this well written and superbly acted movie. This is the short version of my conclusion after watching ""Brooklyn"" the other day. There are some points i want to make about this flick to ""justify"" and explain my thoughts about it and why i gave it a rather high rating. I will start with the acting because i sense it is what most people talk about when it comes to ""Brooklyn"", and rightly so. The film offers a strong lead performance by Saoirse Ronan which is, of course, very important in terms of credibility and transporting the emotional situation her character is in. I have to say Ronan exceeded my expectations, her portray of Eilis was very nuanced and , at times, emotionally powerful. The rest of the cast work incredibly well around her, especially Emory Cohen as Tony. I cant see any flaws whatsoever when i look at the performances : Domhnall Gleeson,Julie Walters,Jessica Pare and everyone else. Whether the scenes are tragic,hopeful or even funny, they are always perfectly executed. This and the well written dialogs create an amazing atmosphere that dragged me into the streets of 1950 NY and keep the movie from becoming a boring torture that tries to pull your heartstrings at all costs. Though it is a slow paced and tragic story filled with all kind of emotions , it conveys them in a subtle and plausible way. Another beautiful thing about ""Brooklyn"" is the directing by John Crowley. He seems to always find the right timing for certain shots and close-ups, it makes the experience so much more immersive and beautiful. The colours and the lighting are immaculate. All these things combined support the atmosphere and make everything feel incredibly real. There are also some shots which are simply magnificent ( i don't want to spoil too much here ). Also worth pointing out is the wonderful score by Michael Brook.The only thing i didn't like at times was the pace of the story and some of the film-editing. In my humble opinion some scenes and places shouldve been relevant a little longer and the cut from one shot to the next ( indoor-outdoor ) felt a little hasty in rare cases. All in all this is a very thoughtful, slow paced and beautifully directed and executed movie. It is about life, how it is affected by the circumstances of your time and how these can change drastically. About family, love and loss. About finding your home. I think this is a great movie and you should definitely go check it out. Thanks for reading!"
BROOKLYN,30 December 2015,10/10,"I have been waiting for this film for ages! it was so so good, eillis moves away from Ireland to go to America living and working in Brooklyn all done and sorted by her sister rose. she goes to Brooklyn and begin to work in a big shop in the heart of Brooklyn and basically lives in a boarding house for girls (that the only way I can explain it) after a couple months eillis is still so homesick and doesn't want to do anything but go home. but then he meets tony. oh tony. tony is an Italian man that is big on family and quickly him and eillis begin dating. tony quickly shows his love for eillis but she isn't sure. she finally admitts she loves him and they are all happy and cute together. but then eillis sister out of the blue passes away and so eillis decide to go home but tony asks her to marry him before leaving and they don't tell anyone. eillis goes home and helps her mother out and goes to see friends and meets a man called Jim. Jim and eillis begin to get very close Jim begins to fall for eillis but eillis wants to go back to Brooklyn. eillis finally tells her mother she's married and that she is going back to Brooklyn the next day. they say there goodbyes and eillis is off to Brooklyn and waits for tony at this work like nothing had changed and the film finally ends. the love this film and eillis and tony are so sweet and i would love it if they made a second its worth a watch but get your tissues ready!"
BROOKLYN,24 January 2016,5/10,"'Brooklyn' was a lovely little bit of nothing much. Gorgeous cinematography, production design, costumes. A beautiful portrayal of worlds. Nothing felt false or forced, but nothing much felt outstanding. Ditto the performances, for me. No false notes by any of them, but no profound epiphanies into the art of acting, either. Everything was really just... lovely.Though it had the guise of something deeper, I'm not sure it ever attained that status. If you think about it hard enough, it's a bit of a brutal chauvinistic entre masking as a powerful woman's story. Our ingénue does not find a lick of happiness until the very first man shows her a bit of attention. And while it certainly doesn't fall into a trope of showing us he's a bad guy (he's not), it doesn't do much for feminism, does it? She falls fast and hard, and the only thing that ever makes her think this could be a bad decision is... Another man? Hm. Okay. And while he doesn't discourage her pursuits, he doesn't do much to encourage them either. He's calling all the shots, and she's following along. It's never explored why, but there's so much loveliness to go around, that I'm not sure we're supposed to think that deeply about it, either. The resolution is too quick and average. And while the messages of 'true home' are sweet, they really aren't that much more than any generic romantic comedy. They are just masked in such an abundance of production loveliness that we must think this is a higher art form at play."
BROOKLYN,16 March 2016,8/10,"First of all, I just have to say it - for once the trailer does the movie justice. It's just sincere of what the movie is about, it doesn't assume the appearance of something else (probably more exciting) in order to attract the audience. It's a movie about a girl, brilliantly portrayed by wonderful Saoirse Ronan, her choices, and where the home is, and what love is about, and all those little occurrences and chances you sometimes stumble through life. It's about being brave and taking a chance, but staying true to yourself and others. Eilis is an amazing characters. She starts off as a sweet, adorable, inexperienced young girl, but complex rather than flat and stereotypical, and transforms into a strong person capable of an extraordinary bravery - being what she is and not what she's supposed to be. Simple, heartwarming and wonderful story."
BROOKLYN,4 May 2021,9/10,"For those of us that grew up in New York in the 60 's and 70's, this was the story of our parents and grandparents. Maybe they weren't Irish, but they probably were Italian, German, English, Polish or Greek and they all had dreams like Elish! They grew up in the 'City' and took us out to Long Island when the hustle and bustle got too much. If you enjoy a simple story about Love and Loss and the sometimes simple 50's-you can't find a better movie! Saoirse Ronan is magnificent and all the supporting cast hold their own in a marvelous story about Immigrants dreaming of making it in New York! Those were the days!"
BROOKLYN,8 February 2016,3/10,"One of the marks of a bad movie is unmotivated or out of character behavior. That pretty much sums up this whole movie. The main character is set up to be sweet, loving, quiet, and innocent. She is forced to emigrate in order to have any kind of future. Then she goes to a dance with a new girl at the boarding house and treats her horribly for absolutely no reason. She remarks, based on nothing, that the girl is ""awful."" I guess the awfulness must have been edited out. She marries hastily before returning to Ireland due to a family death. I mean this was set up to be a real love match and then continues to be that at the end; but, she gets involved with another man while in Ireland for absolutely no reason. She refuses to read or respond to her husband's letters, again for no reason. She never tells her mother she's married...you got it --no reason. She seems to make her decision to return to the US based on the fact that she got busted for being married. But, her reaction to being busted is pure righteous indignation. How does that follow? She's indifferent and withdrawn from her mother, and she spends her time working and running around while in Ireland for the funeral. Then she abruptly leaves with only a day's notice after being busted. I guess we're not supposed to care about the mother at all. It's only this little sweetie that matters. Totally unsympathetic main character and false/unmotivated behavior add up to a really lousy movie. That's what this is."
BROOKLYN,26 August 2016,8/10,"An interesting story of a young Irish woman, immigrating to the USA (LEGALLY) in the 1950's. She had a sponsor and a job to go to; imagine those who came over in the 1800's. My own ancestors came to the US in the 1800's, and I can't imagine what it must have been like to leave their lives behind in search of a better one. I know I'm grateful for the sacrifices my ancestors made. The acting is well done, and you could easily see the difference between life in the USA and life in Ireland at that time. After seeing this film, I'm Proud to be an American of Irish descent!!!This film is a vague example of the difficulties of moving to a whole new world, seeking a better life."
BROOKLYN,19 January 2016,1/10,"The script does not deserve to be made into a movie. Its more like a five minute bed time story for a 5-Year old. The story revolves around the beautiful Saoirse Ronan who won many hearts due to her enchanting and mesmerizing eyes. That's all that is to the movie. A little summary, that's the introduction and the end to the movie. An immigrant to Brooklyn, she has home sickness, but then she thrives, then she goes back and faces the dilemma to stay or go back. Voila! Obviously she goes back, end of story. No drama, no romance, no suspense, and according to me no story-line. Waste of time and money. This movie is so short that I can't even write a 10 line review for it."
BROOKLYN,4 March 2016,9/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it instantly became one of my all- time favorites. Flawlessly acted by Miss Ronan, it grabs your feelz and gets you caught up in her struggles between her old and new lives. Eilis leaves Ireland and everything she knows and loves behind to find her fame and fortune (and surprisingly, the love of her life). Returning home to support her mother after a tragic event, she finds herself in the very situation she longed to be in before she left. A great job, a suitor, her family, familiarity. Watching her struggles between choosing between her old life and new gets personal. I couldn't help but get caught up in the story and praying for an good outcome. This is and will be for many years, a movie that I will be able to rewatch over and over."
BROOKLYN,7 March 2016,8/10,"Have you ever wondered what your life would be like in another country? Would you be happy or would you miss home, successful or feel completely alone? If you catch yourself pondering these questions then you must see the upcoming film called Brooklyn 2016. Directed by John Crowley and Wildgaze Films, Brooklyn is a touching love story about a young Irish girl named Eillis Lacey played by Saoirse Ronan who leaves Ireland in hopes for a better life in exciting Brooklyn. Leaving her mother and sister behind, Eillis sets sail for New York finding herself in an all girl's boarding school, landing a job at an expensive department store and taking bookkeeping night classes. Eillis continues to feel homesick until she meets a handsome young Italian man named Tony played by Emory Cohen. As a lover of Irish women, Tony attends the weekly Irish dances. There he meets Eillis who takes his breath away with her fiery red hair and fragile porcelain skin. Her story of travelling to America and relaxed personality intrigues him ending up in a world wind romance between the two characters. Tony and Eillis fall in love through trips to Coney Island, movie dates and dinner with Tony's parents. After surviving one cold winter in America and a year in Brooklyn, Eillis receives terrible news from her priest, Father Flood played by Jim Boradbent who arranged her move to the United States. Father Flood informs Eillis that her sister Rose played by Fiona Glascott has suddenly passed. This event shakes Eillis forcing her to make a difficult decision to leave Tony and her life in Brooklyn. Before her return to Ireland, Tony proposes to Eillis. They are married the following day at the courthouse and share an intimate night of romance before her trip back to Europe. During Eillis' time in Ireland, she attends her sister's funeral, helps her mother cope with Rose's loss, spends time with her friend Nancy, helps out as a bookkeeper where her sister used to work, and begins a relationship with an Irish bachelor named Jim Farrell. Upon Eillis return to Ireland, Tony begins to fear she will never come back to America because they have since any communication for several weeks. Tony asks his little brother, Frankie, to write Eillis one final letter in his fight to bring his wife home. Jim begins to fall in love with Eillis and reveals his feelings to her asking Eillis to stay in Ireland with him and develop a relationship. This leaves Eillis in a difficult situation, as she must decide whether to stay in Ireland with Jim and her mother or return to Brooklyn and be with her husband Tony. This romantic film reminds us the importance of choice and the fight for love. A five-star performance about risk, love, heartache, fear, freedom, and hope for a better life."
BROOKLYN,28 December 2015,10/10,"So often these days, boy meets girl (or boy meets boy or girl meets girl), then they hop into bed like a rabbit on a date. Hot, steamy sex ensues - without love. This film is not like that - rather, the plot is believable from beginning to end.A young woman from Ireland sails to the United States in the early 1950's and starts to make a life for herself in the US. She finds a place to live and a place to work, and gradually builds up a support system. She meets a young man and they fall in love. While their marriage seems to happen rather quickly, things happen in a way that is believable to ordinary people.The sex scene comes later in the plot, but it is one where the couple is actually making love - especially as they gaze into each other's eyes. So tender is this scene that it is one that I would be comfortable with my kids, ages 9 and 14, viewing (with my 9 year old son, I may have some explaining to do, but the male character is being very much a gentleman, and these two people love each other!)The plot might move rather slowly by today's standards, but the story is so absorbing and believable that you cannot help but fall in love with it! I also have to say I loved the Father Flood character - so gentle a man he was (I once worked as a church organist for an Episcopal priest who has that same gentleness).I was so excited about seeing the movie that I went alone the first time I saw it - but it was so romantic that I had to take my wife back the next day to see it.It is a great date movie, and I would recommend it even for some families (probably early teenage years on up, since people treat one another with respect in the plot).Whether you are young or old, this is one of my favorite films of all time!"
BROOKLYN,12 March 2016,7/10,"And one day, the sun will come out you might not even notice straight away-it'll be that faint. And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past. Someone who's only yours.And you'll realize that this is where your life is.This is one of the best closing speeches that sums the movie.The story develops on one character who has no fear to choose her options. To find herself She has to mat it right and she goes for it. Even in our modern world We choose to stay in our small words with the fear of challenge, something new. The movie says it aloud "" Be brave, Challenge Search and Discover."" It was the masterpiece of lead roles to reflect all character developments and instability of emotions. From starting with blank state to confident and made personal. Cinematography is at its best. I know maybe it is a small detail or has no relation with truth but I love seeing Green details when it is about Ireland. For me the best part of the movie is simple yet so charming love story. Lead actors' luxury visuals compliment the story. Their body language and face mimics flutter my heart. After ""The Notebook"" Stret scene and "" The Legend"" proposal scene Brooklyn has the most sensual love scene. There was no glamor, no exaggeration .. The bus scene was one of the moments I have lost my sense and live the moment. For once I forgot it is a movie. It was so realistic and so intimate. Emory Cohen is another spotlight stealer for me. They all have done a great job but i still don't see the necessity of love triangle. Maybe it was the only turn-off moment for meBut Overall it is one of the magnificent movies of the year"
BROOKLYN,31 March 2020,4/10,"This film is just plain boring. Takes forever to get to the main storyline, just wasted 2 hours of my life."
BROOKLYN,23 September 2017,10/10,"This movie is so good I don't even know where to begin, two years after its release.The story has drama, laughter and sadness. The mood of each setting in the movie is captured perfectly. Saoirse Ronan gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.As a middle-aged man, sci-fi and adventure fan, I never expected I would be much interested. This movie had me glued to the screen. I saw it twice in the space of a month when I recommended it to friends who came over for a movie. The second time I liked it even better than the first. They loved it.This needs to be on your to-watch list."
BROOKLYN,27 May 2019,9/10,"Overall well directed by John Crowley and well performed by its leading star, Saoirse Ronan, this drama crafts a great epoch-production and an appealing atmosphere, unfortunately, its themes are already too familiar and the premise and plot never seem to go anywhere innovative or interesting enough, offering in the end a mixture of Oscar-worthy-like-elements just for the snob eye to fully appreciate, lacking a true genuine hook for average audiences to truly appreciate."
BROOKLYN,23 January 2020,7/10,It's not very often I enjoy a movie better than the book it's based on but in this case it's a definite. This movie is a great weekend chick flick that I gave enjoyed a handful (or more) of times.
BROOKLYN,3 May 2021,2/10,"I did like this movie overall, but I'm so sick of films where a woman's happiness is dependent upon a man giving her attention (or in this instance two men). She's so homesick and depressed until... A Man makes her want to stay and build a life there. She goes back to Ireland and has every intention of returning back to the states until... A Man makes her want to stay and build a life there. Maybe the source novel has more depth and tells a larger story than this film does. I love films that tell a simple story, but this one just missed the mark with me. I wish they would've explored the theme of being responsible for your parents after a certain age more, as that was way more interesting to me than the romantic aspect. Also, I really hated how quickly she was willing to drop her husband for the first Irish guy that made conversation with her once she was back in Ireland. Again, maybe the book gives more nuance to the situation, but the movie doesn't in my opinion. I understand life can get messy, and you develop feelings for more than person at a time, but the movie makes her seem so cavalier about it."
BROOKLYN,3 January 2016,10/10,"I have to give a shout out to the movie ""Brooklyn"" - my favourite movie of 2015! The writing is sharp and witty and it is coupled with excellent acting. Saorise Ronan and Emory Cohen's performances are just so good. You feel their pain, amazement, and her heartache. When the main character finds herself in a quagmire of indecision, your heart aches with her. Saoirse Ronan - She will have to prepare her acceptance speech for the Oscars. Hopefully Emory Cohen will be one of the candidates for Supporting Actor. It was simply exceptional and one I would see multiple times again. The screenplay, incredible score, cinematography, costumes Worth two hours of your time – I can't stop thinking about it!"
BROOKLYN,29 May 2016,6/10,"Brooklyn is a movie about Eilis, an Irish girl who is travelling from her home country to America. She has left her mother and sister behind in Ireland. Her travel is rough, and she meets a woman who gives her advice. Arriving in New York, it takes time for her to get used to her new lifestyle, she is homesick. However, she feels more and more comfortable and meets a young man, Tony, with who she gets along very well. Eventually, they get married secretly. But a big event is going to ruin their plans. I liked the movie Brooklyn, it was not bad, but not one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story is good, an immigrant trying to get used to a new country. It is also about a love story between Eilis and Tony, which is good. I think it was also catchy when Eilis is flirting with the other man in Ireland while Tony, her new husband is sending her letters. Despite the fact that the story is interesting, it is a bit long and slow-moving, and can be boring sometimes. But still, if you like that kind of feel-good movie, it can be good for you to see it."
BROOKLYN,2 October 2021,4/10,"Enjoyable and visually pleasing, but Ronan sleepwalked her way through this. Apart from looking like a beautiful madonna, it was plank acting. Where was the wit and vitality associated with the Irish? Thank god for Julia Walters.Too much gazing meaningfully into the distance with those beautiful blue eyes.When I read the ending was different to the book, which I haven't read, my heart sank,thinking a happy ending had been conjured up, but it is so minor it doesn't change it."
BROOKLYN,11 August 2019,5/10,"This is a pretty, glossy picture that makes a good popcorn movie. I haven't read the novel, so I can't comment on the movie as an adaptation of it. As a standalone work, I enjoyed it up until Eilis married Tony, which imo seemed out of character for her as she had been portrayed up until that point. The way that she carried on the pretence of being single until confronted by the horrible Miss Kelly also seemed contrived to me, and the very feeble reaction of Eilis's mother to her confession of being married highly unrealistic. I can see Eilish agreeing to marry Tony as a way of cementing her newly attained social status by giving her a reason to return to New York. But I don't understand why she didn't tell her mother or her best friend about Tony, or why her mother didn't probe for answers or get angry when she finally broke down. The way the situation resolved itself at the end just seemed too slick and easy to me, and I couldn't help judging Eilis for fleeing Ireland under a cloud of scandal and throwing her mother to the village wolves with the gossip. I couldn't reconcile this girl with the prim, conservative young lady we were shown at the beginning. I know people change, but the change in Eilis was too sudden and too drastic for me to find it believable, and this unfortunately ruined the movie for me."
BROOKLYN,18 January 2016,7/10,"Brooklyn is well written, directed and acted. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Eilis. She's pretty without being beautiful and delivers a thoughtful performance as a young immigrant. The supporting cast is very good across the board, especially Julie Walters as the boarding house matron and Jim Broadbent as Eilis's sponsor. The costumes, hair and makeup are well done for a 1950's period piece.While I liked this film, I can't say I found the story all that interesting. Eilis seemed to live a charmed life. Other than one tragedy and a contrived conflict, life was very good for Eilis.Wait for this on streaming video"
BROOKLYN,18 January 2016,9/10,"First of all, I would like to give a standing ovation for this fine piece of the portrait, which beautifully describes love. Well, I haven't read the novel yet, and I am sure I would love to read it. Not every movie gives you the sense of satisfaction and joy after watching, but this one surely does. Every character in this movie has played their part surprisingly well. It is a worthy watch and the reason why I am writing about it is that I would like others to go through this wonderful feeling which I did. A good movie is something which leaves a strong impact after watching and this one gets that privilege. Clearly, I am trying to contribute as much as I can to promote this wonderful movie.P.S. If you feel that this review is not up to the mark, you surely can discard it. I am just a novice, trying to write my first review without any spoilers."
BROOKLYN,11 January 2020,7/10,"This movie stayed with me forever. Those who stay away from home for work can connect a lot. Who knows what ""Life"" is?"
BROOKLYN,12 August 2021,10/10,Wonderful movie about love and the power of love. The character development is amasing and Saoirse Ronan plays it just beautifully. Worh to see!
BROOKLYN,18 May 2016,7/10,"I was really interested in this movie; a romance with immigration to New-York in the 50's in the background; that seems like a feel-good movie. I don't expect a must-see movie, but an ordinary one, which would be very pleasant; Brooklyn is exactly that type of film. The story-line may seem rather dull but it wasn't, thanks to all the staff who worked on it. They all adapted this book to a movie very well. The cast is excellent; Saoirse Ronan has a really good actor's game, she looks very sincere, but the supporting actors too, the film was really trustworthy. The costumes look very authentic too, like the places where characters go; we are transported in the 1950's, and it is really amazing. I suppose that this film has required a lot of work. Without a thrilling plot, this movie is really great. If you like feel-good movies or if you need a love story, this film is one of the best you can find in the genre."
BROOKLYN,2 December 2015,9/10,"This is a gem of a film that really stands out. The storyline is simple: girl travels abroad, boy meets girl, they fall in love, girl leaves, it gets complicated, then it is resolved.I cannot give more details than that, but the lead actress is superb, combined with a wonderful performance by Jim Broadbent of independent film fame.While the storyline is simple, the acting is done with such palpable emotion by the lead, that one can empathize with what the character is going through. Also, there is some good humor in the conversations that take place through the movie, which gives it a lighter touch, despite the undertones of the film being a romantic drama.The filming on location is well done, as well as the period costumes being spot on for the mid twentieth century.The film is done tastefully, like the movies that were filmed in the golden era from the 30s to the early 60s (ie, nothing seems overdone).I applaud the director, the cast, and writers for creating a piece of art that most likely will win some sort of award in one of the critics' circles."
BROOKLYN,25 December 2015,10/10,"Young Eilis (pronounced Ae-lish), beautifully, artfully portrayed by Saorise Ronan leaves a tired, dreary life in Ireland, working for literally Ebenezer Scrooge in drag, for a flashy, dancing, movie-going lifestyle here across the pond. Just before giving up hope and feeling condemned to be lost in an unknown land, she meets the right person. But when home calls her back in just the right way, her head pulls her there but her heart begs her stay. If art is a mirror to reality, than any good movie has several connections with past, present, or future moments of our lives. What distinguishes Brooklyn and other Great Art is that THIS mirror to reality is panoramic. Everyone in that theater was everyone in that movie! Everybody emigrates some day, be it literally, mentally, or spiritually, we all move on different paths and pilgrimages through life. we've all been in a new place surrounded by new people with no sense of self direction. Brooklyn reminds us exactly how beautiful that can be, being lost in the woods with naught to do but smell roses. Seen at the magnificent Fine Arts theatre, on Biltmore Ave. in Asheville, North Carolina. They have fancy chocolate concessions! Their atmosphere truly enhanced the old Europe meets Yankee vibes, and I was physically moved to tears."
BROOKLYN,12 February 2016,7/10,"First and foremost , when I saw the trailer for the first time I thought this would be another average 'romantic' movie. In spite of the film being Oscar nominated , I thought that there ought to be something Oscar-worthy and so I watched it. Surprisingly the movie isn't average and I quite enjoy it.This movie is not just about love and whatsoever, it's also about family and the inevitability of aging and finding your path. It emphasizes the aching truth of being away from your loved ones and the thought of being like that way for a very long time--which at the end of the movie this 'very long time' turns into forever (and it is very sad).All I can say that it has a lovely plot--heartbreaking and funny at times."
BROOKLYN,27 March 2016,9/10,"Beautiful film, which will touch the heartstrings of anyone who tried to build a life far away from home. Saoirse Ronan, who last struck with her prodigious acting in Atonement, was a perfect choice for this movie and fully deserved the Oscar nomination she received. Her subtle, sophisticated performance was about saying more by talking less. Brooklyn is a coming-of-age story as much as it is a recount of ex-pat melancholia. And the choice heroine has to make between two men is very much pointing to her confusion, being lost between two worlds - her homey, nostalgic past and new, frightening, but exciting life in 1950s America. Saoirse is showing magnificently the transformation her heroine undergoes, from shy, bewildered teenager to composed and resolved young woman. Her acting efforts do not look underwhelming even in comparison to such movie giants like Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent. Overall, Brooklyn is an enjoyable and refreshing film experience, which manages to stay away from over-the-top drama, while avoiding falling into dullness."
BROOKLYN,4 May 2016,2/10,"Im sharing my opinion, which is full of SPOILERS. I did not particularly like this film, partly because of the lack of originality. The main reason however, is that the main character is absolutely unlikeable and inconsistent for me. In details: When she arrives to Brooklyn, she is a shy and closed girl, who is really bad with people. When they go to the Irish dance night she leaves the ""new girl"", because she is annoying for her. The first sign of selfishness, and also an inconsistent move with the introvert character. She moves back to Ireland, for her mother. The second night she is out and start to flirt with a guy, Jim, despite his husband waiting for her in the USA. Girls in love are not like this. As her relationship evolves with Jim, she stops responding for her husbands letters. Again, who is in love would not do this. The all village is speaking about her and Jim. She is really thinking to stay in Ireland, until the old lady unveil her secret (she is married), and eventually goes back to the states, without spending some more time with her mother (for who she moved back). And than she is just waiting for her husband, like nothing had happened, like she is in love, like she is back for him. Am I missing the point?:)"
BROOKLYN,24 May 2016,8/10,"Brooklin is a movie that takes place in the fifties and is about an Irish immigrant girl named Eillis who wants to start a new life in the U.S as many Irish people wanted back then. But it ended up in a love triangle situation and she had to struggle with wanting to go back to her birth land and staying there, in Brooklin with Tony. First of all, I must say I loved this movie, for me it's a must-see! as a fan of one of the supporting characters I really enjoyed watching this movie. Their Best Picture and Best Actress Oscar nominations are well deserved. If you enjoy romance movies but not the too romantic kind this is your go to movie. On my personal opinion I'll say this movie was both thrilling and mesmerizing because of the love story behind the immigration problems she had to cope with. if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it."
BROOKLYN,21 May 2016,4/10,"This review may contain spoilers.This film is about Eillis a young Irish woman, who wants to start a new life in New-York city; in the 50's. But she left her mother and her sister in Ireland . In my opinion this movie is not exceptional at all, it is dull all along... The film-maker doesn't do anything that can marvel the audience, it is a movie for people who have two hours to spend watching a film which could be broadcast on TV a Sunday evening. I must say that the cast was not so bad, the main roles were played by good actors and we can see that because the lead actress who plays Eillis was nominated for an Oscar. This movie is the typical movie about immigration there is not nothing relevant, just love and sadness apart the banality of this couple who is different from other Hollywood couples. I don't recommend this movie apart for people who love romantic and boring movies.See you next Saturday for another review!"
BROOKLYN,30 May 2016,6/10,"The film is about an Irish girl who live in America, in New York City. She meets Tony, an Italian-American. They are in love so they decide to get married. But, Rose, Eilis's sister, dies, so Eilis goes to Ireland to see her mother. But there she meets a new boy. She needs to know who she will choose between the two men. First, the lead actress who plays Eilis plays with a lot sensitivity and she is very charismatic, which gives Eilis all her strenght: a girl who has a lot of dreams but she has a tragic life becausen wherever she goes, she will make people sad. After that, the story is slow-moving and not very original. Again, It's the story of a girl who has to choose between two men and she will break the heart of one of them. But she will get married with a man who will follow their dream...etc. The only thing which is original is that the movie is the relationship between Eilis and Tony, they are not any Hollywood couple. Eilis is taller than Tony and we can see she takes decisions, she does not work like a typical woman in the 1950's. We can say Brooklyn is not a masterpiece and isn't the movie of the year but it is a good film thanks to a talented lead actress and actor because Brooklyn is a love story with no originality."
BROOKLYN,25 May 2016,5/10,"Today I'm going to give my point of view on Brooklyn, the film. I went to see it a few weeks ago with my classmates. To be honest I really don't know if I liked this film or if I didn't like it because I like love stories so when I read the synopsis. The film founded good and interesting but sincerely when I saw it I thought that it was slow moving. The plot focuses on a good story (a love story), the cast is great and the leading actor is amazing when she plays! Even if there are good scenes in this film some things are not good to me! The film is too long and too dull! Only see it if you have time to spare, trust me!"
BROOKLYN,25 May 2016,5/10,"Brooklyn is a love story between an Irish girl and an Italian-American man. Ellis wants a new life in the U.S so she goes there and works in a shop, she makes studies accounting. I have mixed feelings because I Think this is a beautiful love story, people can identify with but for people who don't like that kind of movie that could be very boring because there is no action, or ""comedy"" time. The casting choice is interesting because the lead actor/actress are not very wheel-known and they perfectly play they ""lover's"" roles. I think this is not necessary to grant an Oscar because there are other movies which are more interesting with action and good laugh. Well, for people who love this movie genre, that is a great film, with a little suspense in the middle of the film but that's all nothing more.So that is not for people who like action movies or if you have other things to do, you can see it."
BROOKLYN,24 May 2016,7/10,"Brooklyn is a movie about an Irish woman named Ellis who have plans to move in Brooklyn,NYC,for have a better life. She has to leave her mother and her sister behind in Ireland. This movie takes place in the 1950's and it is a romance.I liked it even if it is a slow moving movie. I mean, there is not a lot of action and I found the lead character annoying. But, I loved the story, I loved the fact that Ellis achieved her goal, she went to Brooklyn for have a job, for have a better life and a better future and that's what she gets. The settings and the outfits are also impressive, we really have the feeling to be in the 1950's, the way the movie was filmed in that period of time. The love story between Ellis and Tony is so nice. After their meeting, Ellis is in a better mood at work and in her general social life. They get married and when she comes back to Ireland she lust think twice about her future plans but her love for Tony is beyond everything. From my point of view, the romance between the two characters is the best thing in the movie. This is not an original story, it makes us dream. Moreover, the actors cat amazingly. I'm not surprised about all the Oscar nominations."
BROOKLYN,29 September 2020,8/10,"Nice atmosphere, well played. Old fashioned good movie."
BROOKLYN,17 January 2016,8/10,"The film Brooklyn stars Saoirse Ronan, who plays Ellis, an Irish woman, coming to America in the 1950s to start a new life. What sets this movie apart from those other coming of age movie, is how tame it is in regards to the strife immigrants would go through. This movie was about a personal story of a young woman in a foreign land finding her place. Even though she is a world away, her problems were not gone. She leaves her family at a low point although she clings to them in a strange world; they are the only comfort and support she knows. A scary situation for anyone to be in, but with time we all learn to cope. In typical movie fashion, she meets a love interest and it makes you wonder where this will go. It seems like the movie did its best to steer away from the clichés of love stories. I like the fact the story did not feel contrived nor formulaic. There were many tender moments that allows Ellis to grow before your eyes. It is the simple things in American culture like eating other ethnic food. That is something new to anyone in a new place. How to covertly eat the food properly. One scene that stood out for me was when Ellis was given advice on what to do in the immigration line. She was told to just act like she belongs there in America—to just be an American. If subtleness is focused then it will reveal you. I quite enjoyed the film. It had great pacing for a two hours movie. In the end, I still wanted more, so I knew this was a good movie. I found the score to be beautiful. It struck a chord with me. This is a charming movie with touching scenes. I highly recommend watching this movie. It is definitely one of the better movies of last year. I give Brooklyn an A- grade."
BROOKLYN,27 October 2016,1/10,"Do you like watching people having conversations over dinner? Well, this is the movie for you. 90% of this year travesty of modern film making is just that. Scene after scene of people eating and some of the worst dialogue I have ever had the displeasure of suffering through. If you need some sleep put ""Brooklyn"" on. You'll drift off before the female lead even reaches America. There is a bit of a saving grace in the Gaelic songs, but it is brief and can't save this sojourn into tedium. If one is constipated the movie does make an excellent laxative. Avoid this movie at all costs. Poop. Crap. Shite. Excrement. Defecation."
BROOKLYN,7 November 2020,2/10,"Every here and there I feel that watching a film was a complete waste of time.
The only feeling Brooklyn left me with, was this."
BROOKLYN,3 January 2020,7/10,I guess this movie was nominated for Oscar under the influence of Trump's immigration policies.
BROOKLYN,18 August 2016,8/10,"It's great to watch a new movie without having to endure the typical cast of ""stars"" that Hollywood is forever jamming down our throats.If you enjoy good story telling, excellent acting and terrific set design, you are in for a treat (I love seeing Brooklyn as it was in the 1950's). Every actor played their part, and played it exceedingly well. Saoirse Ronan in particular, is a remarkable young actress who is simply a joy to watch.My only regret is that she, and many other actors within this movie will become household names in the coming years and be over-exposed by Hollywood. But for now, just sit back and watch the movie, you will NOT be disappointed!"
BROOKLYN,17 December 2015,,"This film is outstanding. Heartfelt and relatable. Saoirse Ronan is an actress with such range, and I've known since Atonement that she has the makings of a very very strong female lead. The art of the performance could be described as effortless, but for the gripping emotion that is so masterfully communicated to the screen.My star-struck infatuation may continue for many years forward, but I must say, if I was Tony (Played by the well cast Emory Cohen), I'd have had the same smile on my face when the plain girl from Ireland stared back at me from across the road in Brooklyn, the 1950s. Give this a watch with a loved one or a double of Irish whiskey, it will please the filmic appetite of a discerning viewer in more than one way."
BROOKLYN,18 February 2019,6/10,"I am a fan of slow paced period dramas, yet this film fell short."
BROOKLYN,17 March 2019,1/10,"She talks down about the other girl behind her back. She is shameless returning to her husband after getting busted by the old women from store.
Love doesn't last long with someone, I agree with that. But the way she treats her husband, her new love, her mother, is awful.I would vote this movie 7~8 stars if she is villain character. But she's not, so this movie deserve 1 star."
BROOKLYN,26 August 2016,8/10,"Brooklyn — The Movie Review: Home is where you live your life---Spoiler Alert---I would say the movie is the best of I have seen this year. Not just in terms of the high quality of the movie, but also I can put myself in the shoes of the main character. It was good, because it caused me to think, moreover, resulted in the existence of this review.As a girl came to US alone 3 years ago, I am living in Brooklyn. English is not my first language, but I am still enjoying my life here. America is a magical place if you have a dream.Back to the movie, there is several topics I want to discuss.Home and Love — the theme of the movie as I see.The movie was so real that caught the every emotion change of the character without monologue. (Good acting Saoirse!) There are four stages of the emotion change of Eilis. 1. Homesick: New to a country, feeling as an outsider 2. Love : Meeting Tony changed Eilis, which finally made she feel that she can have her life here. Tony was such a sweet Italian boy, who has the blue print of future. (I will discuss about the love between Tony and Eilis further) 3. Back to home : Everything was so familiar with memories of friends and family. Coming back from America made Eilis shine in the small country. She was fashion and modern in appearance; smart at work; her vision was broaden oversea. She became the charm, everything that she wanted to have before leaving became so easy to get. She was confused— why going to U.S with all these? A stable job, wealthy fella\ potential husband and the company of family. 4. Back to U.S : While I was confused about how the movie would go, here comes the twist/climax of the movie. Eilis met her old employer, the mean bakery owner, who knew her secret marriage in Brooklyn. All of a sudden, Eilis's fantasy of living in her hometown went broke. She realized that the old town she hated was still the same one, nothing changed even she owned more. She was no longer belong here. Then she became honest about her marriage with her mom and went back to the life in US. She realized that her life was in Brooklyn with Tony.Here are my answers to couple questions raise while watching the movie myself: a. Why Eilis chose America over Ireland? The future, the possibility, the unknown and the excitement b. Why Eilis chose Tony over Jim? Family, Tony has a big and warm family. c. What make Eilis feel home? Love, the love around her not just romance. The manager of the department store, the priest, the landlady of the boarding house, Tony's familyd. Does Eilis really love Tony? To be honest, I was not sure about it until the end of the movie. Tony was a sweet boy for sure. Comparing to Eilis, who studied at College, Tony didn't has much social advantage. I think that's why Tony was so caution and insecure at the beginning of the relationship. As for Eilis, it took her while to understand her feeling after hearing the three-words from Tony. During her time back to Ireland, Eilis seems to enjoy dating with Jim without sparing tears for missing Tony. e. Does Eilis mum love her? I think Eilis's mother really love her. She could do anything to keep Eilis around — a husband and a job. But when she heard Eilis's confession, she said goodbye in a short manner that left less guilt and pain in Eilis's decision. Overall, in the end of the movie, Eilis's monologue gave us the definition of home.""You have to think like an American. You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die, and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it. But you will, and it won't kill you. And one day the sun will come out — you might not even notice straight away, it'll be that faint. And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past. Someone who's only yours. And you'll realize... that this is where your life is.""Good luck to everyone who is trying to find a home in US!"
BROOKLYN,6 November 2015,10/10,"Wow,Brooklyn, easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Once you see it you can't stop thinking about it especially if you've made a similar journey to Eilish's,which nearly everyone has. Although it's set in the 1950s, 'Brooklyn'is still universal today. Saoirse Ronan gives her best (Oscar worthy) performance along with Emory Cohen in this magnificent coming-of-age tale about becoming independent, finding love and carving out your own path in life.Julie Walters really cracked me up in the boarding house scenes as did the supporting cast. I liked how there was no cattiness amongst the ladies. They all looked out for and supported one another which is a rarity in cinema these days. Domhnall Gleeson gives a fine performance as Jim, a change from his usual roles. I can't recommend 'Brooklyn' enough. It will make one cry, laugh, think about one's own life and the choices one's made. As Steven Zeitchik LA TIMES said ""If you dislike Brooklyn the movie, you have no soul""."
BROOKLYN,8 January 2016,2/10,"I thought this might be a great movie but it turned out to be not so good. As the minutes passed by I can tell is a flat plot with nothing more interesting than a girl traveling abroad for a better life and finding love so genuinely easy and fast. Script is predictable at times and looks forced in others. At first, I thought Saoirse did a great job with the accent until I listened carefully. Personally, I'd have been amazing to put an Irish actress for this role (no discrimination intended), it seems more appropriate. American people trying their best to speak with an English accent makes them look not good, sometimes. Looks so forced and not well speak that pronunciation gets lost. By reading all the past reviews I think is a little bit overrated and it's actually not a big deal of a movie."
BROOKLYN,9 January 2016,9/10,"A highly watchable, absorbing film that will surely be a marker for emerging stars such as Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, and Domhnall Gleeson. There are also many excellent supporting performances by veterans such as Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters and many youngsters as well. The American immigrant story has been told many times, but the picture still seems fresh and original. Ronan, in particular, is remarkable as the lead who must carry the film. She is so good you could cry and laugh in every scene, and you wish you could just tell her everything will be all right. One feels she will be able to do anything she wants in the future. It's a little film about little people, much in the tradition of Marty or On the Waterfront. No one is on the way to greatness here, but you still care about them.The only problem is that the movie runs out of story before it runs out of film time. The last part depends on too many unconvincing events and coincidences. How can a young woman who appears to be in perfect health suddenly just die for no stated reason? Just saying she must have been ill and not told anyone doesn't answer the question. And how can a fabulous boyfriend and a promising job appear suddenly in a place where neither seemed to be available before? And what are the odds that a brief chance encounter in New York will be reported in an obscure Irish town? The appearance of a young girl who is in exactly the heroine's original situation also seems unlikely. And our heroine returns abruptly without any goodbyes or any trips to or from the docks. One feels like the film had a maximum run time and late scenes had to be cut to achieve it. Or else the film just had to be wrapped up, and the end had to be as is (sort of like the minimal ending added to an unfinished piece of music)."
BROOKLYN,14 February 2016,10/10,"This was an absolutely incredible movie! The lead actress, Saoirse Ronan, captured the essence of her character, Eilis, perfectly. Perfect for viewers of all ages, with a captivating storyline and concept. Great setting and had a great feeling throughout the whole movie! We would definitely recommend it for all ages, from the elderly to the young. One sex scene, but not too long and with more of a romantic feel to it. Good plot twist involving a love triangle and puts you on the edge of your seat. Really draws you in! Suitable setting and clothing for the era of 1950s. Script was also well written for the year it was set, actors were inspiring and the overall set was brilliant and had a great 1950s feel. Definitely a 10/10! Loved every second of it!!"
BROOKLYN,28 February 2016,6/10,"Photography great. Production great. Lead actress great. The problem, in a nutshell, is that the character of the female protagonist so carefully established in the beginning is completely sacrificed when she returns to Ireland. She lies (by omission) in not telling anyone--including the guy she leads along romantically--that she is married. The hurried marriage itself is out of character, as is the premarital sex. Her out-of-character activities when she returns to Ireland are there to add a bit of drama to the simple love story. But sometimes simple is best. A plot that maintained her character could have been worked out if the script writers had considered an alternative that maintained her character. For example she was in love with the Italian and perhaps betrothed to him, but hadn't yet married him when she went back to Ireland. She returns to Ireland because her sister died then has to choose between her love in Brooklyn and her needy mother in Ireland (not between her true love in Brooklyn and a new boyfriend in Ireland). Not so easy to accomplish maybe, but it could have been a truer and deeper story with the rendering of a real and consistent character. Finally, the horrible storekeeper in Ireland was just a caricature of a human being, the Italian family was a cliché, and the romantic male lead was an attempted clone of Marlon Brando."
BROOKLYN,1 March 2016,7/10,"Overall the the film was good, with a decent cast and some good acting, and it is definitely worth a watch, if a bit slow in parts.But, and this is a big but for me, the Ireland of this period is shown as a small-town, middle class society. Nothing is shown of the poverty which existed, and the only explanation of the migration of thousands of people to the USA is that there were no jobs. In fact, the only scene featuring poor people showed ex-pat Irish down on their luck in Brooklyn. Neither does it show the hardship and prejudice faced by many Irish and Italian immigrants to the USA.Saoirse Ronan is as good as ever, but for me the standout performance was by Emory Cohen, who plays Tony in a natural, believable way. Good cameos by Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent too."
BROOKLYN,5 March 2016,9/10,"As an Irish emigrant to the UK this story touched me so deeply. I never wanted to move out of Ireland but after my brother came home from Australia and told me that there is life outside of Ireland and that I needed to go out there and live it. I moved away when I was just turned 20 and thought I was going to the UK for just 3 months. 25 years later I am still here. I miss Ireland dearly, but like the main character in this movie I met someone who made me realize my live was here now. This film made me cry several times and for this I would recommend it because it tells a true story of what its like to be an emigrant, no matter what country you come from or go to. It was so beautiful filmed and the music is so so beautiful. I can see why this was nominated for 3 Oscars"
BROOKLYN,20 March 2016,10/10,"I watched this movie for the first time a few days ago while on a plane traveling from Ireland to Australia after my first visit to the country to say goodbye to my best friend who had passed away.Needless to say I was an absolute mess but at the same time it gave me so much comfort to hear that beautiful Irish accent and yes the emotional connection now to the movie will mean this review is ridiculously bias.Brooklyn is a film that has so many elements that relate to so many people around the world and not just Ireland. There's a story about living abroad and finding your place in the world which so many of us have gone through as well as issues about self discovery and growing up, death and grief while tangled in this beautiful world of love and romance. There are so many elements to this movie that it's really a testament to the beautiful novel written by Colm Toibin and the very brave and brilliant screenplay adapted by Nick Hornby that was able to translate the messages from the novel to the screen. Combine that with the vision of John Crowley and the Oscar worthy performance by the breathtaking Saoirse Ronan, and you just have this brilliant and amazing heart warming movie. This team didn't just do Ireland proud. They just did proud period. Great work everyone that worked on this film."
BROOKLYN,2 April 2016,3/10,"I don't really understand why so many people like this movie. Through the whole movie you feel like the main protagonist is going to experience some sort of character development but she never does. The most character development in this entire movie is Eilis learning how to eat spaghetti. OK, so first of all, In the beginning you think of Eilis as this nice innocent girl, then she comes to America and sort of seems like a different person. She lives in this house with a bunch of other immigrants while she's living in America. A few of them you see like once or twice but Eilis acts like shes known them her whole life. Also there are these two little snobby girls that kind of just make you angry through the whole movie but its OK because Eilis seems to think they're alright because they taught her how to eat spaghetti. Then there's this one girl with curly blonde hair that was a little different but she seemed very nice. Later on at a dance, Eilis meets some Italian guy and then points out to him the girl with curly blonde hair and makes fun of her. Then you start thinking huh, Eilis kind of isn't very cool. Then she goes back to Ireland because her sister died which kind of added nothing to the plot. Anyways so she gets back to Ireland and doesn't tell anyone that she's already been married to the one Italian guy. So since her family didn't know this, they try to set her up with this random Irish guy who seems nice but, you know, Eilis is married and should stay loyal to her husband. So she proceeds to flirt with this random guy and receives many letters from her husband but just stuffs them in a drawer. So Eilis kind of blows at this point and you're not really liking her. Then the people in Ireland find out that she was married and this one old lady calls her out that she was flirting with another man while she was married and Eilis gets all mad and dignified like she has some right to be angry. Then the movie acts like it wants us to feel sorry for this girl who you kind of just hate at this point. Then she goes back to America and hugs her husband. Nothing was concluded. There was no closure, no character development, and a protagonist that you kind of grow to hate. The movie was pretty, thats one thing i'll give it. Otherwise it was kind of just, eh."
BROOKLYN,23 May 2016,2/10,"The film, BROOKLYN is a sentimental movie. Personally, I found this film boring, but beautiful: I loved the landscapes, the costumes, the houses, the cars... This is typical things of the 1950's, and I love that. the actors and actresses play their roles well and they are handsome (except Mrs Kelly!). For example, Eilis is a beautiful woman, cute and much appreciated.She plays with perfection her role of the girl who does not know who to choose between Jimmy and Tony. After that, I want to say it's a long film, which does not mean much. There is no moral in this film, except the fact we mustn't love someone else when just married... It's obvious, right ? I have not found any interesting moral. I saw at the end of the film that this story had been adapted from a novel; many scenes are too long and boring; for example the party where Eilis meets Tony, or when she works, or when she goes to the beach... So, I give two stars to this film BROOKLYN. One star for the landscapes, and one star for the cameraman's work, because this is good job."
BROOKLYN,23 May 2016,3/10,"Today I'm gonna tell you my feelings about the film ""Brooklyn"". Honestly, I didn't like it, it was a classic love story with a love triangle between the main character, Eilis and two young boys. The story was dull and slow-moving, I wasted two hours of my life to watch a tasteless love story with people gossiping for two hours. I gave three stars because the places were great to see and only for this reason because if I had marked the actors only, I would have put only one star. Mercifully, the film is only two hours long otherwise I would have asked to get my money back because love stories are not movies that I like to watch and this one was really hard to watch until the end, I was almost sleeping when it ended. I couldn't stay awake when I watched it a second time to write my review and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch a film like that again. I really advise you not to see it, it's a waste of time."
BROOKLYN,25 May 2016,4/10,"Spoiler The plot of this film focuses on an Irish immigrant girl who wants to leave her country and live in the USA. This part was really great, we could see the life of an immigrant and that's interesting and new! Not like those awful love stories that we always see in romances. So, I think that was the best part of the movie and also the shortest. After this wonderful part, there is a long and boring love story. We can see some bad sides of the main character who falls in love with two men. I found that this film was boring. I even slept. Love stories are always the same, so when I went to see this movie, I was thinking that this one would be different and original but I was wrong. So the main part of this movie was boring even the first part was great. Only watch this film if you have plenty of time to spare, this is the only piece of advice I can give to you."
BROOKLYN,25 May 2016,3/10,"Brooklyn , is a movie about Eilis a irish girl who lives in Ireland. She has an awful job with her terrible boss who is hard on her. She had to stay keeping her mother with her sister but , Eili's sister gives her an opportunity : to go to Brooklyn , NYC USA ; She could have a new job , better maybe , and she will stay with other gilrs like her in a house. But , in every movie like this one , something bad will happen ; in fact she is homesick , then she cries and she fells bad .And that is something boring , it's an uninspired movie . Badly actriss plays . The dresses are cliché of the 50's and full of sterreotypes. She fall in love of a guy , get married , then she go back to Irland and met a new boy , she will obviously be interest by this one but will return to her husband. Finly I think that , it's slow-moving , they should renamed it ""Eilis life"" . Probably better than ""Brooklyn"" ."
BROOKLYN,29 May 2016,,"Brookyn is a drama movie about a young Irish girl,Eilis who crosses the Atlantic Ocean and settles down in Brooklyn, New York City. After the death of her sister she decides to come back to Ireland and must choose between her country and her life and her love story with Tony. About the leading role, I think she plays her role with honesty, there is no extravagance. Her exceptional performance granted her an Oscar-nomination. She plays her role with simplicity and she may look old-fashioned but she does not. Eilis and Tony are a very authentic couple with not artifice. It's a very moving film about love and decision to make a very good mirror of our life. It' not a gem, nor a must-see either but it's a great example of film-making. I recommend this film for all the people who love dramatic love stories and films and for people who like films from the 1950's."
BROOKLYN,1 June 2016,6/10,"in the first place, I have to say that I was rather reluctant to see this movie because it looked like a basic love movie, with a dull plot and a slow moving rhythm; there was a good probability for the scenarists to talk about the Irish immigrants' life conditions in the mid-20th century New York though. I was hoping that it would be developed in the movie. Here's the synopsis: Eillis is a young Irish girl who's going to move to America, because she has no future in Ireland. She settles in Brooklyn and for a while she feels very homesick but then she meets tony, a young Italian-American man; they fall in love and the uninteresting romance begins. In the meanwhile, her sister dies, she marries tony and goes back to Ireland to see her mother. I marked this movie 6/10 because I think that it didn't show the social side of the story enough apart from some scenes like the Christmas one, with old Irish workers. I am not really disappointed because I wasn't expecting much, but I think that I can't bear a real love/romance movie for almost two hours"
BROOKLYN,31 May 2016,8/10,"""Brooklyn"" is a movie about Eillis, an Irish girl who's going to America because in Ireland she has a boring job and she can't find a boyfriend. In Brooklyn, she meets an Italian boy she's going to fall in love with, but a family problem will make her come back to Ireland and Something or someone will make her hesitate about coming back to America. At the beginning, it seemed a little too long to me and quite boring. But when she leaves America to come back to Ireland, the movie starts to rock! You're suddenly in Eillis's shoes and the way the movie is filmed is fantastic, you know everything that Eillis is doing but Nothing about her Italian boyfriend. And the actors are just stunning, the actress who plays Eillis is maybe one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen and her American friends (the two girls) are so funny!"
BROOKLYN,1 June 2016,8/10,"Released in 2015, the film ""Brooklyn"" chronicles the journey of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman who immigrates to America in the early 1950's. Brooklyn offers a compelling look into the world of Europeans, many of whom came from destitute backgrounds, who viewed America as their great chance to achieve upward mobility for themselves and their families. As a historical telling, Brooklyn does not break any new ground or give any revelatory insights into the waves of Irish immigrants settling in the outer boroughs during America's newly prosperous decade. As a work of intimate storytelling, however, Brooklyn soars with its' portrait of a naïve yet steely young woman who learns to create her own definitions of love and home. Directed by John Crowley and written by Nick Hornby (adapted from a novel by Colm Toibin), everything about Brooklyn feels sentimental, but the sentiment is earned through small character moments that build a relationship between the viewer and the film. We meet Eilis as she slogs through another day at her part-time retail job, stifles a yawn during Sunday Mass, and quietly has supper with her mother and sister. In these brief scenes, we get a sense of Eilis' life in Ireland as one of repetition, duty and longing for something more. With the help of her family priest and her dutiful sister Rose, Eilis launches a plan to move to America to begin the next phase of her life. Crowley and Hornby do a strong job of showcasing Eilis' homesickness in her first weeks in America; her discomfort at work, as well as at the dinner table of her new boarding house, is palpable. Saoirse Ronan, an experienced actress who has an Oscar nominated breakout role here, conveys Eilis' sense of alienation and longing for her home country with mere changes of expression. Once Eilis meets a down to earth, affable Italian named Tony (Emory Cohen), her life in America really begins and the film shows this through faster paced, brighter scenes played with engaging chemistry between the two leads. For a time, the film settles into a groove and looks as if it's shaping up to be a likable but slight period romance. In the third act, however, a tragic event draws Eilis back to Ireland, where she struggles to choose a clear path for her future. Does she return to the life she forged in America with Tony, or settle back into familial comfort (not to mention a new Irish suitor) in her hometown? Brooklyn will certainly please audiences who enjoy strong character studies and period pieces. It does not break any new ground, but does deliver a period specific look at immigrant life while asking the timeless and universal question, ""What makes a home""? The naturalistic performances of the entire cast, in particular Saoirse Ronan on whom the movie rests, make the material feel honest and true."
BROOKLYN,8 August 2018,8/10,"Saoirse Ronan shines in the film with her strong acting. This movie deals with several important issues such as homesickness, love, family, and country love. One of the main theme of the film was choices, sometimes in our life we have two options to choose. It's all depends on our minds to choose the right path."
BROOKLYN,19 November 2019,9/10,"Imagine that, if you're a young who struggling with, or seeking another kind of life oversea, you may face up homesickness, lacking of cash, loneliness... You gotta figure all out one way or the other. And you probably meet someone who will be part of your future life... What need to be afraid of is, better offers are given when everything just settled down. Stay with or leave? No matter which decision you make, someone let down anyway."
BROOKLYN,17 February 2016,9/10,"Such a beautiful film from start to finish. I wasn't familiar with the book so didn't know what to expect but I wasn't disappointed at all. It was filled with endearing, witty, and emotional moments. The change of colour throughout the film reflected EIlis's storyline and the whole thing just had me gripped, the characters, the 50s and the setting of New York. I've recently bought the book and can't wait to read it and then re-watch the film, I think it's one of those that I'll watch over and over. Also a big Domhnall Gleeson fan as well as his work is so impressive at the moment and it was lovely to see him being Irish!All around beautiful film, highly recommended."
BROOKLYN,13 June 2020,2/10,It starts off slowly. It proceeds at a pedestrian pace. It appears to be going somewhere. Then it goes nowhere. Then it ends. In the end I was left feeling it was a complete waste of time. The characters are not well drawn. Elis does things that are boring and other things that are inexplicable. The only interesting character was the small town gossip. In a word: boring.
BROOKLYN,29 November 2018,10/10,"This is a story told beautifully with breath-taking shots, and powerful characters, the movie Brooklyn, a relatable, passionate drama, embodies great contrast between life in Ireland and America when the character Eilis Lacey immigrated to Brooklyn, New York for opportunities that weren't available for her in 1950's Ireland.This journey to self discovery was one with parts everyone can relate to. The choice to stay in the comfort of your own home, family, and culture or to jump into a life of uncertainty, but potential success was portrayed beautifully by the actress Saoirse Ronan. The actresses real connection to Ireland, being born and raised there and extraordinary acting of a witty, timid, but courageous Irish woman created an irreplaceable authenticity.The director, John Crowley, intensified the viewers relationship with the Character with long shots of Eilis with her pale skin and Irish red hair showing silently strong emotion. Just in time, when her homesickness is at her peak, she falls for Tony Fiorello, an American-Italian man that lifts her spirits in a magically pleasant relationship made this way through beautiful shots, and color arrangements leaving you wanting more.The story shifts when she was greeted with terrible news that changes her life and forces her to make difficult decisions. This event forced her to visit home, and when she gets there, it wasn't what it was for her before she left. She arrived to new opportunities that weren't there before, a new job, even a new man. This was emphasized by beautiful shots of Ireland colors, and beaches that weren't shown before she left. As she remembered what her home was like, she came to a realization that home can be made anywhere including Brooklyn, where she would go back to the open arms of her lover, Tony.Although there is this heart-warming love story, it's more than that. It shows that both men she meets in Brooklyn and Ireland are suitable for her, as well as both, America and Ireland are suitable for her but the choice is completely in her hands making this movie unlike other love stories. It's not a story about soulmates and her not being able to live without the other, it's her choosing a life that she wants. Something that wasn't normal for her in the beginning of the film, when she was uncertain in herself and in the future that was chosen for her.The last scene of her on the boat going back to Brooklyn showed hope, and confidence in her future. She grew into an outspoken independent women and saw that, making the decision to go to Brooklyn much easier. This movie is an eye-opening look to see how things have changed then compared to today. It let's us step back into a time where we didn't have everything like communication and knowledge right at our fingertips. Overall, Brooklyn is a coming of age story of a girl gaining confidence and security within herself. The theme of finding home in any place is understood and has been experienced by just about everyone."
BROOKLYN,22 December 2018,10/10,"Really enjoyed this film - very natural and brilliant acting, Very understated not the usual Hollywood glitter thank goodness."
