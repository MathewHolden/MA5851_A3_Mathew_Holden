THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 June 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" worth seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you'll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won't be exactly sure why!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 August 2016,9/10,"That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.While it isn't quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don't like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast's roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson's style), 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.It really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.Alexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it's never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.In conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one's taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2015,,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)** (out of 4) Wes Anderson's critically acclaimed film tells the story of concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) who befriends a young lobby boy and goes on an adventure dealing with a priceless stolen painting.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL has gotten some of the greatest reviews of the year and it even managed to pick up several Oscar-nominations but it just didn't work for me. Every once in a while a film will come along that I watch and I can understand why so many people love it but it just doesn't sit well with me. This film is a perfect example because there's no question that the film has some very good performance, has it's own look, feel and style and there's also no doubt that it's really unlike anything you've seen before. With that said, the film just felt like all style and very little actual substance.There's no question that Anderson is one of the most interesting director's working today and he often creates films that are just so original and fresh that they seem to take place in some weird, alternate universe. This film certainly fits into that category because visually speaking it's quite remarkable and it seems like each shot must have taken hours to set up in order to get right. The miniatures used in the film are obviously miniatures but it's clear they were shown like this for a purpose. It builds atmosphere. There color and set design is another major plus working for the film and especially the lay-out of the hotel.Another thing that works are the performances with each actor doing a very good job. Not only do we have Fiennes but there's also F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe, both who easily steal the show. There's certainly nothing to complain about in regards to the performances as everyone steps up and comes across with very original characters.Having said all of that, I just never once connected with the film and this is certainly not good when watching something. Obviously many people love this movie and it's a hit with most critics but to me there just wasn't much here to keep me entertained."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 May 2017,5/10,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is another quirky comedy from director Wes Anderson, a man who can seemingly make no other type of movie. I watched and enjoyed the first half an hour of this film, finding it fresh and inventive; however, the magic began to wear off after this point, and by the end I found it more than a little tiresome. I have a feeling that the director's style would best be suited to short films, not overlong efforts like this.The problem with the film is that it has no meaning, no depth. What you see up on the screen is everything you'll get. The plot is simplistic, and devoid of much interest; Anderson keeps you watching only by including endless random cameos from all of his celebrity friends and actors. I've never been a fan of Ralph Fiennes and he can't shake off his coldness here, although the young cast members fare better. Some of the stars, like Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum, are great but get too little screen time. The movie raises a few smiles and has some nicely dark moments, but I was left wanting more from it and I found the whole experience oddly hollow."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 July 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an old relic in the eastern European former republic of Zubrowka. In 1985, the author of the book Grand Budapest Hotel (Tom Wilkinson) recounts how in 1968 he (Jude Law) got the story from Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). He talks about his early life as Lobby Boy (Tony Revolori) with the original concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932 who was willed a priceless painting by Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) setting off a battle with the woman's family led by her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and the violent Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is the girl of purity who's in love with Zero. Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) is the executor of the will.This is a new high for Wes Anderson. He's filled this with his usual unique visual style and his quirky characters. In addition, he has used it in an exciting thriller with a bit of mystery. There are some really dangerous bad guys. There is real tension that isn't always there for a Wes Anderson film. He always had the quirky, the fascinating and the unique. This has so much more than that. It's a pretty fun thrilling ride."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 March 2014,9/10,"It's so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: ""The Great Race"" and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" What transpires is Ralph Fiennes' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth. One reviewer talked about it not making any money. If that's the case it means that a whole bunch of viewers have passed up a gem."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 September 2015,,"as remember of pieces from a lost age. as homage to a lost world. as trip in a special form of fairy tale. a fantastic journey , spectacular inside in heart of genres, books, adventure's basic idea and humor with a lot of nuances. a film who impress for its strange simplicity, for new version of honesty, for the emotions from childhood. for the game who has the public as partner. for the original , subtle and profound image about the history of the XX century. short, a delight. full of surprises and nostalgia, remarkable for the science of detail, mixture of stories and exercise to understand different taboos in nice manner. a film about us. from a not ordinary director."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 February 2015,6/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the newest film by Wes Anderson and also the one that gave him more nominations at the Academy Awards than anything he has done before. Of course, he also wrote the film, together with Hugo Guinness with whom he collaborated in different ways already for ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". The film begins with an old man telling a story to a younger man and we find out that the old man is the owner of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and worked as a lobby boy many decades ago under Ralph Fiennes' central character. This film is very Wes Anderson: the straight camera shots at objects people, the unique set decorations and the subtle humor from start to finish in the script, especially the way Fiennes' character interacts with everybody. The Mendl cakes also fit it perfectly. The big shooting at the end was pretty hilarious. It was obviously not to be taken seriously and just so random just like the way the characters slided down the snow with so much speed earlier in the film.The film is packed with known actors, mostly with very small performances, sometimes only one or two scenes: Adrian Brody, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Owen Wilson, all of them Oscar nominees (the latter two not for acting). And finally Willem Dafoe is also in the film, as a ruthless killer with a somewhat different villain performance than his Spider Man turn, but equally great. He is just so good when it comes to playing scary, maybe my favorite from this movie. From the German perspective, I was surprised to see Michalowski, Markovics and Lukas in several scenes.Occasionally, it is a bit style over substance, but most of the time, it's a decent movie. However, I am still surprised about the awards recognition it got. Best comedy/musical/screenplay of the year I cannot agree with. That does not mean it's bad though. I would recommend it, especially if you have seen and liked some of Anderson's previous films. Also, I'm curious what Revolori's career will look like in the coming years. The mentor/student relationship with his character and Fiennes' may be the same like with Fiennes being his teacher in terms of acting in this film. Will he disappear quickly or have a grand career? Time will tell."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 September 2019,10/10,"Wes Anderson had made a delightful offbeat art house film that never outstays its hospitality. It has a stamp of an assured filmmaker, confident of his eccentric style.Mr Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) his tale of the now faded Grand Budapest Hotel over dinner.In 1932, the Grand Budapest Hotel was epitome of decadent and luxury somewhere in Eastern Europe. Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a refugee started out as a newly hired lobby boy. He is taken under the wing of the eccentric concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes.)Gustave in effect runs the hotel and attends to the personal needs to some of the older ladies who stay in the hotel such as Madame D (Tilda Swinton.) When she dies, Gustave is bequeathed a valuable painting. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is far from pleased with this. Gustave is accused of the old lady's murder and Dmitri's henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) makes sure any irritant is disposed off quickly.Wes Anderson has directed a whimsical and absurd black comedy with a camp performance from Fiennes that has a startling odour. It was a shame that he was not Oscar nominated. There are cameos from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Edward Norton. The story can get dark and murderous at times, it has an underlying sadness. You see proto fascists who demand to see papers of all the travellers on a train. Enough to parallel the real world of the 1930s."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 July 2014,7/10,"A writer (Jude Law) travels to the decadent Grand Budapest Hotel in the mountains of the Republic of Zubrowka and he meets the owner Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who is a very simple man. Zero invites the author to have dinner with him and he tells his story and how he became the owner of the hotel. In 1932, in the glorious days of the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) is hired to work as lobby boy under the command of the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) that becomes his friend. Gustave manages the hotel and staff and also attends the sexual needs of the old ladies lodged at the hotel. He spends one night with Madame Céline Villeneuve ""Madame D"" Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) and soon he learns that she was found dead at home. Gustave summons Zero to travel with him to the funeral and he learns that he has inherited the valuable painting Boy with Apple. Madame D's son Dimitri (Adrian Brody) and her family do not accept that a concierge may have inherited the painting and Gustave and Zero steal it and return to the Grand Budapest Hotel to hide the painting. Gustave promises Zero that he would be his heir for helping him. But Gustave is falsely accused of murdering Madame D and is arrested and imprisoned. Will his friend Zero leave him die in the prison?""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is another original and weird movie by Wes Anderson with his usual bizarre characters. The story is funny and entertaining and it is impressive the number of stellar cameos along 100 minutes running time. Tilda Swinton is unrecognizable in the role of an old lady. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Hotel Budapeste"" (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"")"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 March 2016,,"I watch a lot of short films and you can tell that Wes Anderson has very much made an impact on up and coming filmmakers due to how often you see people trying to make what they call 'a Wes Anderson style film'. Watching these film is mostly interesting because of how often these efforts fall short. It is a reminder to me of how hard it actually is to do 'whimsy'. To make it work, you not only need to make it happen, but you also need to do it in a way that gets the audience into the space they need to be in so as to be able to enjoy it; without this it is often just annoying.I was thinking of this because GBH is a great example of this working. This is not to say it is brilliant cinema, because in the end it is a whimsical piece but it does do it really well. The structure itself tells you where you are, because this is a film that opens with a girl paying respects at the bust of a dead author, who we then jump to as he starts to tell the story that was told to him by another man – a story which is also that of a story being told – and it is this story which we see for the most part. It is a structure that allows for the exaggeration and elaboration of all told stories, and it allows us to go with the sheer silliness of the tale. I say silliness, but actually the film keeps a lot which actually engages in the adventure plot, but yet at the same time delivers enough decadence and invention to allow us to enjoy it as a piece of fun.The cast match this. In many films it would be a real distraction to have so many famous faces in one film, however here it works – again because the audience are mostly positioned just to go with whatever. Fiennes is the beating heart of the film, and if he does not make his character work then the whole thing would struggle; as it is, he makes it work really well, with such color and flourish. Revolori is equally good, and needs to be since the friendship and his link to the presence (or plural) is also critical to making it work. The rest of the cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless to name them all – but they all add to the whimsy rather than overwhelm it. Technically the film is a beauty, with great shots, great design through, and a sense of second-hand wonder which fits the story-telling structure.All told, it is a quite wonderful piece of silly adventure. It works because it knows itself, and it delivers itself really well in a way that draws the viewer into the space we need to be in to really go with it. This is not easy to do, and Anderson does it really well here."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 July 2018,10/10,"Not since ""The Book Thief"" have I been so entertained by a movie that knows how to create art. Rather than mention the plot, I will say that the language flowed with grace and humor. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) our main character had the ability to be classy while being crude. The harpsichord soundtrack fit well into the production. One could see where classical action/comedy/romance films of the 50's and 60's have influenced the film until it spoofs them in a generic fashion. Even minor characters like Saoirse Ronan are carefully crafted with odd flaws, such as her facial birthmark shaped like Mexico.Gustave describes sex as ""eating steak."" His affairs with older women he claims, ""The cheaper cuts are more flavorful."" He is also a lover of poetry and writes poems and speaks poetically with a way that amuses the audience.While the film has a classic look and sound to it, the humor is suited for a younger audience."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 August 2014,8/10,"If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback. Depending on what your viewing behavior is, you'll either enjoy the really out there feeling of this or you won't. Normally I'd think I'm not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it's not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it's the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the ""tension"" high. If you're not sure watch the trailer, if it is appealing watch, otherwise don't waste your time"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 December 2014,8/10,"I don't know if you'd call Wes Anderson an acquired taste or not; I didn't like 'The Life Aquatic' very much and felt the subject matter for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is part of the reason the culture is hitting bottom of the barrel levels these days. Yet this film held a strange fascination for me that's tough to put a finger on. I enjoy movies with rapid fire dialog, and crusty language doesn't bother me, so those features of the picture delivered quite well. There was also the stylized CGI used in the scenes of the hotel itself and that very odd funicular railway construct that seemed just the right sort of bizarre for my taste. I managed to recognize virtually all the cameo players except for Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel, the rest were on either side of hilarious. Willem Dafoe's Jopling character was particularly over the top and made for an intriguing assassin. The story itself was rather interesting, a sort of offbeat heist and murder mystery, but with elements that defy classification. I guess with Anderson's films you have to take them one by one. This one I could take a couple more times."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2015,8/10,"The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.This is the highest-grossing Wes Anderson film to date, as well as his highest budget. Some (particularly IMDb voters) would say it is his best. Perhaps. On first viewing, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was the stronger, more cohesive film... but this one may take a bit more time to sink in, and may require multiple viewings.Certainly it has Harvey Keitel in one of his better roles, as well as a near-endless stream of great actors, many of whom (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, etc. etc.) have worked with Anderson repeatedly. This may be the film that will grow in stature as the years go on."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 March 2014,9/10,"So far I've liked every Wes Anderson movie that I've seen, and that includes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". This comedic tale of murder and mayhem in inter-war Europe has everything that we expect in Anderson's movies: dolly shots, pronounced colors, and quirky characters. Watching the movie, I got the feeling that Anderson made it with the aim of appealing to a larger audience due to some scenes that tended more towards action. Not that it subtracts from the good stuff in the movie. One thing that struck me is that even though the movie takes place in a fictional country in Central Europe, every cast member uses his/her real voice: we hear American, English and French accents. It's as though this country is a microcosm of the entire Western world.This time Anderson assembled what appears to be his largest cast. Ralph Fiennes as the hotel concierge and newcomer Tony Revolori as the lobby boy are the main focus, but there are lots of others (including, naturally, Anderson regular Bill Murray). It's just a really fine piece of work. I'll be very eager to see Anderson's next movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 October 2014,7/10,"I heard a good amount of this film during its release in the cinema, because of its director, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox), and an impressive all-star cast, I didn't know much else besides that, but I was most keen to watch it. Basically, a memoir was written by a character known only as 'The Author' (Tom Wilkinson), it recalls his trip to the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968, in the Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state damaged by war and poverty. The Young Writer (Jude Law) finds the remote mountainside hotel, it has fallen on hard times with glistening facilities in need of repair and fewer guests, the Writer encounters and in the evening has dinner with the elderly hotel owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), and he starts telling his tale of how he came to own the hotel and why he will not close it down. The story flashes back to 1932, during the glory days for the hotel, then young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) was a lobby boy, in charge of the staff is devoted concierge Monsieur Gustave H. (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes), important messages from the unknown owner are relayed through lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). When not attending to needs of the hotel's wealthy clientèle or managing staff, Gustave courts numerous ageing women looking for ""exceptional service"", one of these ladies is Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) who he spends a night with before she leaves, one month later she dies in mysterious circumstances, at the wake her will reveals she bequeathed Gustave the very valuable painting Boy with Apple. This angers the family who wanted to inherit the painting, including the Madame D's son Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis (Adrien Brody) who lashes out, Gustave and Zero return to the Grand Budapest Hotel and the painting is locked away in the safe, Gustave makes a pact with Zero that for his help he will be his heir, and following this Gustave is arrested and imprisoned accused of murdering Madame D, after forced testimony by her butler Serge X (Quantum of Solace's Mathieu Amalric). To aid Gustave with his escape from the prison Zero has his fiancée Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) bake cakes to send, with stone working tools concealed inside, he and a group of convicts dig their way out of the cell, Gustave and his servant team together to prove his innocence, while cold-blooded assassin J. G. Jopling (Willem Dafoe), working for Dmitri, who kills Kovacs for refusing to work with Dmitri, also pursuing is investigating Inspector Henckels (Edward Norton). The adventure takes Gustave and Zero to a mountaintop monastery, the only person who can clear Gustave of the murder accusations is Serge, but before he can reveal the important information he is strangled by Jopling, the assassin is chased fleeing the monastery down the snowy mountain, they stop and there is a face-off at the cliff edge, Zero rescues Gustave and pushes Jopling to his death. Back at the Grand Budapest Hotel, an outbreak of war is imminent, the hotel has been commandeered by the military who are in the process of converting the hotel into a barracks, Gustave is heartbroken, Dmitri catches Agatha trying to retrieve the painting, chasing and gunfire ensues, until Gustave's innocence is proved by, the Madame D's second will is discovered, hidden behind the painting, she was the unknown owner, in it she leaves most of her fortune, the painting and the hotel to Gustave, he becomes a wealthy regular hotel guest, while Zero becomes the new concierge. Old Zero tells that on a train journey enemy soldiers inspecting papers took Gustave and shot him, Agatha died from influenza two years later, and he inherited the hotel and fortune Gustave promised him and he vows to continue the legacy of the Grand Budapest Hotel, he explains this is not loyalty to Gustave, it is his last remaining link to Agatha, and the Writer departs for South Africa and does not return. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Ludwig, Jason Schwartzman as Monsieur Jean, Bill Murray as Monsieur Ivan, Owen Wilson as Monsieur Chuck, Bob Balaban as Monsieur Martin, Short Circuit's Fisher Stevens as Monsieur Robin, Léa Seydoux as Clotilde and Hostages' Larry Pine as Mr. Mosher. Fiennes is the perfect choice for the most prominent character, I agree the likable newcomer Revolori is a little overshadowed by the big names, including Dafoe, Norton, Brody and Ronan who stand out in my memory, its choice of colouring for costumes and scenery is nice and vibrant, the eccentric characters add something to every scene, and the weird and wonderful story with a murder mystery and a charming hotel is interesting, an entertaining wild yarn comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Music, Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for Best Original Music, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay for Wes Anderson, and Best Make Up & Hair, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 December 2014,7/10,"The writer/director Wes Anderson seems to have translated the story directly from Stefan Zweig's German, except for a few more or less modern interpolations, like ""F*** you."" Really, it begins in the Grand Manner, with someone telling a story to someone else, that is then illustrated in the following scenes, much like Marlowe in ""The Heart of Darkness,"" missing one intermediary, I think. And Henry James in ""The Turn of the Screw."" It must have been a powerful convention of the time, around the turn of the century.The translated prose that comes to us is phrased in elegance, very formal and dignified, like the Grand Budapest Hotel itself in its fashionable early years, a stately pleasure dome, all pink gingerbread, perched on a mountain top, accessible only by funicular railways. (No riff raff allowed.) I'm afraid I missed the middle part so I can't spell out the story. I don't think I could anyway because it's not exactly linear. There are lots of characters, all somewhat cockeyed, and many incidents, some briefly violent.But if the story of the little lobby boy who grows up to be F. Murray Abraham isn't linear, the direction certainly is. I've never in my life seen a more SYMMETRICAL movie, a more CARPENTERED movie. Forget about traditional reverse angle shots, in which two people are speaking and the camera alternates from peeping over one shoulder to peeping over the other. Everybody looks and speaks straight into the lens.The settings are equally stylized. You want to see a huge dining room? You see it framed from the entrance, each side mirroring the other. The chandeliers are equidistant. When people walk or run past the camera, or away from it, or towards it, they seem to do it on x and y axes, as if the scene were the solution to a problem in calculus. There's no other film quite like it.Yet it's funny too. Near the beginning, when there is breaking news, we see a succession of local newspapers. The names of the newspapers run along lines like ""The Middle European Star"" and so forth, and one of them, which gets no special treatment, is ""The Continental Drift."" The dialog sometimes descends from formalized and ornate into the vulgate. It doesn't happen often but when it does, it's a surprising and refreshing break from all those sumptuous phrases.I look forward to catching the part I missed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 February 2015,8/10,"The titular The Grand Budapest Hotel was in the fictional central European nation of Zubrowka; it has since been demolished but here we learn how its last owner came to possess this imposing building and why he stayed in the servants' quarters when he visited. Told in flashback, we learn that owner Zero Moustafa, a stateless immigrant, started off as a humble lobby boy working under M. Gustave, the hotel's previous, and greatest, concierge. M. Gustave was particularly popular with the female guests, especially Madame D. When he learns of her death he and Zero go to pay their final respects. Much to his surprise he discovered that a recent change to her will left a valuable painting to him a painting the rest of the family are determined he shall not have. He takes the painting setting in motion a train of events which will see him and Zero pursued across the country, his jailing and subsequent escape as well as romance for Zero before we finally learn how Zero came to be the owner.When I started watching this film I knew little about it apart from the fact that it had won a fair number of awards and was popular with the critics. In the opening scenes I thought it might be trying a little bit too hard to be quirky but once we were back in the past seeing M. Gustave and young Zero's story I was quickly hooked. The story contains wit, excitement and a degree of tragedy. The whole cast, which includes plenty of well-known actors in cameo roles, does a fine job; most notably Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori who play our protagonists M. Gustave and Zero respectively. The action doesn't look realistic but this is clearly deliberate and affective in a way that means we can believe things like the rather unlikely jailbreak. If there is one complaint to be had it is about the strong language; it isn't too excessive but may put off some viewers who would otherwise have enjoyed the film. That is a small quibble though; overall I found this quirky film most enjoyable."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 July 2014,,"I watched this movie twice. The first time I neglected to consider that it is a Wes Anderson movie. As such I tried to make sense of it in the usual way and, while I enjoyed it enough, my second viewing a few days later was much more fun. In fact, I'll go so far as to say this is one of the most fun movies I have seen in quite a while.The most common element of every scene is that there is nothing in common with normal expectations. Every scene is done in a very careful, particular style. Whether it be colors, or camera angles, or unexpected dialog, often all of these and more, the whole movie is a delight of invention.The phrase ""never a dull moment"" applies.The story has three layers, 1986, 1968, and 1932. It starts with the older author telling of his younger self meeting with a mysterious man who tells him of his past, in 1932, and that is the story featured. It is about how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel in a fictional place. It involved wealthy guests, a bisexual concierge, and a very new lobby boy, destined to become the old owner of the hotel.It has a great cast of some of the best actors, many of them typical participants in Wes Anderson projects. The story is fun, but it really is secondary. The filming and story-telling mechanism is the best aspect of this movie.I watched it again March 2017 and in February 2020, and each time found it as enjoyable as ever."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 May 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson's stunning Grand Budapest Hotel is a treat for the eyes and years. It's visually gorgeous, as well as being witty, dark, and magnificently acted by a huge cast which includes Ralph Fiennes, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe.F. Murray Abraham plays the owner of the Grand Budapest, Zero Moustafa, who tells how it came to be his. In order to do that, he has to tell the story of the concierge, M. Gustave (Fiennes), who befriends Zero when he becomes a lobby boy. Gustave inherits a painting, Boy with Apple, from a wealthy older woman (Tilda Swinton) and, in the midst of a family fight for her fortune, takes off with it. Meantime, the world is entering the war.Anderson has created an amazing universe that is like watching an MGM film with a foreign story back in the '30s, such as Idiot's Delight. It goes back to the days of exquisite service, enormous wealth and privilege, and idyllic beauty.It's also hilariously funny, with Fiennes popping off the one liners and the young Zero (Tony Revolon) keeping a serious face throughout. Many of the scenes, including the ones in the prison, are priceless.There's a dark and poignant undertone to The Grand Budapest Hotel because for all its wild characters and antics, it portrays a way of life that is no more.Everyone is excellent, but Fiennes has the largest role and is fabulous -- elegant, funny, flirtatious, and demonstrating masterful timing. It's really a new side to him -- considering that I saw him do Hamlet on Broadway.Terrific, don't miss it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 April 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, a tale of an old-lady womanizer (Ralph Fiennes, the reason if nothing else to see the film) who is accused of murder and up against an evil son and set in the backdrop of a fake-but-sorta-real European landscape in the mid 1930's, is at its best when it evokes a comparative feeling through its style that may or may not have anything to do with the film itself.This I mean is the passage of time for cinema, as its in three times (30s, late 60s, briefly mid 80s) and had three different aspect ratios, largely shot in 1:33 (the square, not the widescreen rectangle for you laymans) And at this, of course, the film is always a pleasure to look at. That's a given for Anderson. His work here is especially colorful, every hue pops and shines even in that few minutes where it's Black and White on the train, and Fiennes and company are game to play along...Yet, ultimately, I felt maybe a little-sorta let down following the one two punch of Fantastic Mr Fox and Moonrise Kingdom. Though a lot happens in Budapest hotel and its oozing period detail (both real Euro and made up), it's ultimately a bug-eyed cartoon and only two main males, Gustav and his bell-boy-turned-surrogate-son Zero, have two dimensions with everyone else with one. And of course Willem Dafoe looks cool in black leather on a motorcycle (unintentional homage to his debut in the Loveless mayhap crossed with a second tier bond villain ?) and the music is sweet and catchy.I just didn't see the characters having enough depth for me to care that much past the facade Anderson has made up. As with Fox and Life Aquatic to an extent, this is a world where many times you'll see this world created in the hotel and out as a diorama, and all Anderson and his cameraman shoot it impeccably. maybe, this time, TOO impeccably, for me. It gets to the point where even in its controlled pov you''ll know where the cameras going to move, who will be where, even what they'll probably say, filled with witty and sometimes very funny jargony speech.And at the end of it all it's fun to watch, has a look that is unlike anything at the movies right now, and has the sort of bittersweet ending Anderson has made a hallmark of his career. It just doesn't stick with me and prod at me like the director does when he gives characters with firmer consequences at hand. And yes I know this story is in the backdrop of a (pre) war environment and involves falsely accused murder (if one must give the highest comparative praise, think the cultural refinery in Renoirs 30s pics with a Hitchcock yarn also from the 30s). But... too many characters, all drawn with broad strokes, and just when you think you're getting a handle on one like Ronans character shell slip away from the movie so long that the motivations get mixed up.Recommended for being the work of a master stylist (And Jeff Goldblum cause he's who he is) but not recommended if you want a movie with something to say, which after Moonrise and Tenenbams and bottle rocket, I know the man's capable of. 7.5/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 September 2014,9/10,"Having seen quite a few of Wes Anderson's movies, I knew to expect a certain rhythm and flow concerning characterizations and story. So I knew that most of the characters will speak in a certain clipped tone that never wavers and certain jump cuts were also expected. Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time. So on that note, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel if you don't mind such an unusual experience of a noncommercial nature."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 December 2014,1/10,"I'll even take the Bates Motel in Psycho after seeing this truly awful film. How did the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody and F. Murray Abraham ever get suckered into making such a colossal mess as this film?You would think that this film could have done without the constant narration and would have been on the scale of a Grand Hotel like atmosphere. Instead it concentrates on the relationship of a concierge and bell boy, with the former jailed for allegedly poisoning a frequent elderly guest. Most of it concerns itself with the bell boy aiding the concierge's escape from prison and the two constantly alluding the authorities.To me, this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Abraham relates the story as he did when he played Salieri in Amadeus in 1984."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 May 2014,,"This film tells the story of a man who owns a run down hotel that used to be a glamorous social hot spot.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" tells an intriguing story about how a man comes to own a grand establishment. It is filled with joy, tears, love, courage and integrity. The plot is so beautiful that will touch anyone and everyone. I really liked Ralph Fiennes' performance as the head butler, he is reserved but charismatic, charming all the ladies completely. It's a lovely tale, and the plethora of stars is also great to watch. It's fun to spot the stars! I enjoyed watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 August 2014,7/10,"A Wes Anderson fanciful farce. Anderson directs, shares story writing and is in charge of the screenplay. This is a maniac fantasy that takes place between the world wars in the Republic of Zubrowka. Gustave H(Ralph Fiennes) is the eclectic concierge at the prestigious European Grand Budapest Hotel, who takes a bellboy named Zero(Tony Revolori)under his wing and preps him to become a trusted friend and protégé. Mr. H caters to his guest and even makes clandestine visits to some of the most snooty and wealthiest older ladies. And on occasion the richest of men. Gustave and Zero find themselves embroiled deeply in a heated battle for a family fortune. The meticulous concierge is accused of art theft and even murder, making for riotously and hilarious flight from the authorities. Mr. H and Zero, while on the run, contemplate a logical conclusion. Playful, witty, quirky and near impeccable story telling using a backdrop of flashbacks.Packed full of stars for sure: F. Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Adrian Brody, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 April 2015,8/10,"I've never been a fan of Wes Anderson . He's something of a one trick pony who makes black comedies with well known casts where the cast obviously enjoyed working on the film more than this audience member enjoyed watching them , That said when FILM 2014 reviewed this movie guest critics were falling over themselves to lavish praise on it especially the technical merits and the close attention to detail . Also you should bare in mind it picked up several Oscar nominations including winning a few Oscars and considering it was released in the Spring of 2014 about seven or eight months before the main big hitters with their eyes on rewards go on general release it seemed to have stuck out in many voters minds . Giving it a chance due to the acclaim it received I found myself very surprised as to how much I enjoyed itThis wasn't the case at the film's start . ""Oh dear"" I thought ""We're getting a story within a story as a narrator talks over a series of events . One thing I share in common with Robert McKee is an instinctive hatred of voice over since it's usually delivered in a clumsy manner which caused me to hate THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS with a passion and thought we'd be getting more of the same but I stuck with it for which I was rewarded with a brilliantly witty and delightful black comedy The plot is relatively straight forward . A hotel concierge Gustave finds himself in himself hot water and the metaphorical water is going to get a lot hotter he finds himself in episodic dilemmas . I don't want to make it sound like it's an earth shattering plot because it's but Gustave is beautifully drawn and Ralph Fiennes makes the most of the part especially some wonderfully sardonic dialogue and insults .. He's an anti-hero with humanity and you find yourself greatly sympathising with his plight as well as laughing out loud at the absurd situations . Fiennes is excellent and one wonders why his performance wasn't nominated for more awards . He is at the apex of a wonderful cast though I should perhaps warn that despite a large number of well regarded actors most of them only appear in cameo roles . Perhaps the best performance from the supporting ensemble is Willem Dafoe as Jopling , a silent and sadistic assassin on the trail of Gustave and the house boy Zero Despite some bad language and violence there is a very old fashioned feel to TGBH and that's not just because of its chronological setting . Wes Anderson must be a genuine film fan and I was constantly reminded of the great Michael Curtiz . Does Budapest appear in the title as a reference to the great Hungarian born film maker ? At other points in the movie I was reminded of THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and one chase scene reminded me of the best James Bond sequences . Typing that last line I was reminded of what a mess this film could have ended up as and yet it's a very consistent and involving film on both a narrative and visual level which I enjoyed watching"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 October 2021,7/10,"This is one of these films that you just have to watch to believe. No amount of analysis or attempts to define it are really going to make much sense of the thing. It is Wes Anderson's equivalent of a Lewis Carroll story. There is a loose framework to the plot with luxury hotel concierge ""M. Gustave"" (Ralph Fiennes) and his new hotel lobby boy ""Zero Moustafa"" (Tony Revolori) embarking on some quirkily perilous adventures. There is an hunt for a will that might reveal the beneficiary of a vast fortune and for a priceless painting - and all of this set against a backdrop of political and social upheaval that keeps the scenarios changing constantly and amusingly too. It's got just about everyone making cameo contributions, some more effective than others - but for the most part the pairing of the leading two works well enough to help the story develop in a curious, erratic and sometimes quite unfathomable fashion. For folks who want the traditional style story then maybe skip this, but if you can let your imagination run a bit wild then this makes for an enjoyable deconstructed piece of cinema that moves along at quite a pace and works well."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 July 2014,10/10,"Orson Welles Famously said something like ""Hollywood has given me the greatest toy set a boy could ever want."" Wes Anderson is one of the Few New Hollywood Directors that has Embraced that Boyhood Enthusiasm and Unleashed it Upon His Body of Work with Joyful Abandon. He doesn't give a Hoot if it is Commercially Viable, Sellable, Marketable, or even Understood by the Great Unwashed. This is Anderson at Play take it or leave it.Most Critics Love His Quirky, Offbeat, Out of the Box take on Mainstream Movie Making and Relish in His Delivery of Unexpected, Untried, Ultra-Realism. His Dialog is not Easily Digested and doesn't Fit Comfortably in the Ear. His Visuals Overwhelm the Eye and Stimulate Cortexs that are Not Known to Exist.Watching His New Movie it is Obvious that He has Perfected His Craft and is so at Ease with His Art that the Complications look Effortless. What Emerges is an Art Form within an Art Form for the Art-Film Connoisseurs and a Vibrant Free for All for Anyone with a Modicum of Interest in being Entertained, Albeit, in a Distinctly Unconventional Method.No One is Making Films like Wes Anderson and there Probably isn't Room in the Multiplexes for Many to Try, and some may be Relieved that He is a One of a Kind. It is Verbally Futile to Describe the Insanity of the Plot and to Try and Review what took place On Screen. It is better to just sit back and Watch it All Unfold and be Amazed at its Wonderful and Fully Fledged Pretensions.NoteIf you really must know what it is about then be advised, it is a screwball, slapstick, satire, fantasy, action, romp. The Marx Brothers meet Monty Python. But that hardly begins to describe what it is. It is more, maybe, or less perhaps. Depending."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2014,7/10,"I can't say that I've heard of Wes Anderson, unlike the majority of posters here; I was attracted initially by the title, which conjured up images of the sort of lost world personified by the Orient Express and whilst that wasn't too wide of the mark what I found was a touch of the Monty Pythons and the sort of fare turned out by Terry Gilliam. It seems to be going out of its way to defy classification and in that sense adheres to the statement by Scott Fitzgerald; start with a character and you find you've created a type; start with a type and you've created nothing, with Anderson endeavouring to create a type of movie. The shaggy dog element may well irritate some people but I found it rather beguiling and an effective way in to a labyrinthine film that should repay a second look."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 April 2014,7/10,"Great...in spells. Also quite dull in spells. Broad feel of the is typical Wes Anderson: quirky, whimsical, sentimental, sometimes funny. However, here he is unable to sustain the interest and continuously engage the audience throughout. Some parts just drift.Set up and initial development are great, as is the conclusion. It is the third quarter or so where things get tedious and uninteresting. Essentially the movie becomes a silly common-or-garden chase movie. Performances are great. Ralph Fiennes was perfect for the lead role and carries the movie with aplomb. Tony Revolori does well as the Lobby Boy, Zero. Supporting cast is star-studded, include many Wes Anderson regulars and don't put a foot wrong: F Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwarzman, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Siaorse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, Fisher Stevens. I even found Jeff Goldblum convincing and non-irritating, which is rare for me.A bit more focus in the middle-to-end sections and this could have been a great movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,8/10,"You know your movie is getting overcrowded when it becomes nearly impossible to tell who belongs on the poster and who is to be relegated to an Unbilled Cameo. Milton Welsh (AEON FLUX, CONAN THE BARBARIAN) is on-screen for more scenes lasting longer than is Tom Wilkerson. However, most everybody else at my screening were gray-haired old farts approximately Wilkerson's age, as opposed to the Milton Welsh crowd, who are still in their reproductive years. Therefore, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL plasters Wilkerson on its poster to appeal to its target audience (folks with one foot in the grave), most of whom could not distinguish Welsh from their own great-grandchildren. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is ALL about the past, with lines such as, ""His world vanished long before he ever entered it."" As Michael Bay once said, ""Those who can, transform the ""Now"" into Tomorrow. Those who cannot, make 'Art' films."" The best thing about THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is that it provides so many jobs for codgers. With every flick like this, it's likely to be one less plug for the Old Broke Actors' Poor House we'll be forced to sit through at the multiplex (and less social security gravy train dough stolen from today's teens)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2014,10/10,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) **** Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F.

Wunderkind filmmaker Wes Anderson continues to outdo himself in all matters of whimsy in this mirth-filled mischievous romp set in a fictional European country in flashback 1932 with bisexual bon vivant Fiennes (having a field day) as the concierge of the eponymous posh establishment taking a new 'lobby boy' (newcomer Revolori) under his wing as mentor/protégé and embroiled in an inheritance battle of wits involving a priceless painting, thuggish vulgarians and a dash of sharp-witted observations thrown in for good measure. Resplendent production design by Adam Stockhausen, Robert D. Yeoman's picture perfect cinematography and a cheeky screenplay by Anderson and Hugo Guinness inspired by Stefan Zweig's canon the film is a well-oiled machinery enmeshed with a crazy quilt more-than-a-cameo filled cast of Who's Who all relishing their moments however brief of irreverency and tact(less) behavior. Fun, funny and surprisingly poignant with a hint of historical nostalgia of what could've/should've been. Finally the first Must See Film of 2014!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,6/10,"I don't know that I'd call ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" Wes Anderson's latest bit of whimsy, exactly a misfire, but I certainly didn't like it as much as some of his other recent films.Almost always there's a strong emotional core to Anderson's films that anchors the idiosyncratic absurdity that defines his style. But that emotional core is missing in this film, leaving us with a slew of Anderson creations, cartoonish characters that don't engage us because they're not given time to. His film is stuffed with famous names, some of them Anderson regulars, some of them new to his world, but virtually all of them are given short shrift. I was excited when, for example, Jason Schwartzman made his entrance, because he's been given the opportunity in previous Anderson movies to make such a comedic impression, but he gets about two minutes of unremarkable screen time before the story whisks on to the next disposable character. It's the first Wes Anderson film I can think of that caused me to actually be annoyed by his self conscious style, a sure sign that in other respects Anderson was off his game.I should add, though, that Ralph Fiennes is sensational. His performance is the one thing about the film I can praise without reservation.Grade: B"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,9/10,"In the 1930s M. Gustave, the concierge of a grand hotel in middle Europe, becomes embroiled in plots relating to the death of an elderly guest with whom he had been having an affair.I had seen two Wes Anderson films prior to this: The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, which I found interesting and quirky although I am not sure whether I was actually entertained by it, and Fantastic Mr Fox, which I disliked. My failure to see any other Anderson films was more due to circumstance rather than intent, although I have always garnered a Coen Brothers vibe in that I get the impression of private jokes to which the audience is not necessarily party. So I approached The Grand Budapest Hotel with trepidation.And I loved it. From the opening framing sequence (which frames another sequence, which frames a third sequence which frames the actual story - the first two are completely unnecessary, albeit quirky and entertaining - I loved the son's intrusion and apology) I was sucked in. There is a huge cast of Names, some providing mere cameos, others taking on meatier roles. There is fantastic production design which ties into the storytelling -- the highly distinctive visuals and the script work together, often to specific purpose - and great direction, plus an engaging deadpan central performance from newcomer Tony Revolori as Zero.But towering over everything is Ralph Fiennes: M. Gustave is urbane, charming, efficient, (almost) always sincerely polite to everyone, and (under the surface) quite weird. He is also very, very funny, and you can see how much fun Fiennes is having with him, displaying a gift for comedy which, while not wholly unexpected, has never been as obvious as it is here.I really, really enjoyed this."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2014,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the finer things in life are an acquired taste. The exception to that is writer/director Wes Anderson's films. You either ""get"" it or you don't. Which side of the line you fall is much more a matter of style and taste than intellect.This latest from Anderson may be his most visually distinct and stylistic presentation yet. He even tosses in a bit of a plot so that we have reason to follow the outlandish antics of master concierge (and murder suspect) M Gustave - played with comic verve by Ralph Fiennes. Yes, the Ralph Fiennes known for such comedy classics as Schindler's List, The English Patient and The Hurt Locker. Admit it, when you need a laugh, you fire up the Ralph Fiennes stand-up routine. OK, so he did have a role in the terrific In Bruges, but nothing has prepared us for seeing him in this witty, fast-talking role at the center of Anderson's wildest ride yet.As any follower of Anderson films will tell you, there is always fun to be had in picking out the members of his supporting cast. Assisting Mr. Fiennes with this one are Edward Norton, Jude Law, F Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton (oddly cast after Angela Lansbury dropped out), Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, Mathieu Amalric, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Of course, there is also Bill Murray, in his seventh collaboration with Anderson. The most impressive new face is that of Tony Revolori, who plays the teenage Lobby Boy in training ... a role that turns vital when he is befriended by Gustave.None of that really matters though, as the best description I give this is spectacle. It's a whimsical romp with nostalgic tributes throughout. It's a movie for movie lovers from a true movie lover. You will notice the three distinct aspect ratios used to depict the different time periods, and the music is perfect ... from Vivaldi's Concerto for Lute and Plucked Strings to Alexandre Desplat's fantastic composition over the closing credits. If you are up for some hyper-stylistic eye candy, this one is tough to beat (especially this time of year)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,8/10,"Talking recently to a fellow IMDb'er,I was surprised to be told that Ralph Fiennes had teamed up with film maker Wes Anderson for a title that was going to come out in a few days time!.With the last movie that I had seen by Wes Anderson being his charming Claymation adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr.Fox,I felt that it would be the perfect time to pay a visit to Mr Anderson,in a grand Budapest-based hotel.The plot:The present:Walking up to a monument statue for a writer that is based next to a long closed down hotel,a girl begins to read a book by the writer called The Grand Budapest Hotel.The 1960's:The Grand Budapest Hotel-Republic of Zubrowka:central Europe.Spending time in a hotel whose better days have long since past,a young writer suddenly notices a hotel guest who he has never seen before.Being introduced by a hotel staff member,the writer finds out that the stranger is actually Zero Moustafa,the owner of the hotel.Taken by the writer's clear signs of intrigue,Zero arranges for them to sit down for a meal,where he begins to tell the writer about his long history with the hotel.The 1930's:Getting hired to work as a bellboy for a grand hotel,Moustafa finds himself receiving a warm welcome from the hotel's owner M.Gustave H,who along with keeping a keen eye on all aspects of the hotel so that it remains immaculate,Gustave also gives some of the hotel's most loyal (widowed) guest a special bonus,by sleeping with them.Despite openly admitting that she's not a 'fillet steak' Gustave finds himself taken aback by loyal hotel guest Madame D telling him that she is going to die in a few days time. Believing these to be the words of a half-crazed woman,Gustave waves goodbye,and turns his attention to the hotels cakes.Sadly,Gustave soon finds out that he was completely wrong,when he receives a letter requesting him to attend Madame D's will reading.Taking new bellboy Zero Moustafa along for company,the train that Zero and Gustave are on is stopped by soldier's of a fascist army called Zig Zags, (The ZZ) who only allow the train to carry on,when leading ZZ general recognises Gustave from his childhood memories.Finding the will reading to be filled with dozens of family members who Madame had called 'hangers on',Gustave is left speechless,when he discovers that Madame D has left him her most prized procession:A highly prized painting titled Boy With Apple.Angered by his mum's surprise,'loyal' son Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis tells Gustave that he's been waiting years for his mum to die so that he can at last get his hands on the painting,and that he is going to make sure that neither he,nor Zero walk out with the painting.Finding themselves stuck in a corner,Moustafa and Zero decide that if Taxis does not allow them to walk out with the painting,then the only option that they have is to steal it.View on the film:Splitting the title's different eras into 3 changing aspect ratios,co- writer/(along with Hugo Guinness) director Wes Anderson allows the immaculately detailed work that art directors Stephen O.Gessler,Gerald Sullivan and Steve Summersgill have created to perfectly express the rise and fall in the hotels success,as the designers contrast the fading Art-Deco appearance that the hotel suffers in the 60's,with a ravishingly pomp that fill the hotel with precisely designed cupcakes and rooms which appear to contain furniture which has been built in a manner that will allow every minimal detail on the items to shine.Creating an amazing atmosphere which allows for the distinctive features of the production design to stand out,Anderson and cinematography Robert D. Yeoman give the film an immensely warming 'hand made' quality,by using vast wide shots to show the quirky side of the character's location.Along with his keen eye for vast wide shots,Anderson also displays a terrific willingness to openly manipulate the movie's speed,with Anderson speeding up the film to give a number of scenes a strong comedic Fantasy feel,which is counter by Anderson displaying an unexpectedly downbeat side,by using stilted shots to gradually build a surprisingly tense affair,which is emphasised by Alexandre Desplat's coiling score.Taking inspiration from the works of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig,the screenplay by Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness strikes a delicate balance of placing the mysterious death of Madame D. at the centre of the title,whilst making sure that the comedic elements never become overpowering,and that the present day ruins of the hotel hang over the entire events.Placing the viewer in Zero's shoe's,the writer's brilliantly display the growing relationship that the character's have,as Zero goes from being desperate to get rid of the stolen painting as fast as possible,to Gustave risking his own life as he attempts to save Zero from the ruthless ZZ.Playing both the young and the old sides of the character,Tony Revolori and F.Murray Abraham both give extraordinary,complimentary performances,thanks to Revolori showing that despite having a sense of naiveté ,Zero also has a firm loyalty to his boss/soon to be friend Gustave,the progression of which is expressed by the spot-on 'elder statesmen' direction that Abraham takes Zero to.Joining the 2 Zero's,Ralph Fiennes delivers a stunning performance as Gustave,with Fiennes bouncing off every hilarious scene that he shares with Zero,and also keeping Gustave away from becoming a 'player' by displaying a genuine sincerity in his concern for Zero's safety,and also a real determination to make the building the grandest hotel that there will ever be in Budapest."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 May 2015,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014): Dir: Wes Anderson / Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Adrien Brody, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton: Another great Wes Anderson comedy after such gems as Moonrise Kingdom and The Fantastic Mr. Fox. This is a colourful comic epic about the history of this European hotel. It is narrated over dinner by Zero, a former lobby boy informing an author how he came to own the hotel. Anderson highlights the film with a large ensemble cast entering in and out throughout the colourful sets and quirky camera shots. Ralph Fiennes plays owner Gustave who is framed for a murder. The victim is Madame D whom he flirted with and whom he learns left a painting to him in her will. This enrages her family who viewed the valuable painting as something that should have been left to them. Instead Gustave and Zero steal the painting and conceal it in the hotel safe. Fiennes leads the cast with pencil moustache and a hit on his life after escaping prison to clear his name. Tony Revolori plays the loyal Zero who benefits for his protective loyalty to Gustave. Adrien Brody plays Madame D's enraged son Dmitri who wants Gustave dead. Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, a pastry chef at the Grand Budapest and who marries Zero. She also demonstrates bravery when it factors into transporting the painting when Dmitri comes looking. Edward Norton plays an inspector who first comes into the film on the train to the funeral. He eventually ends up hunting for Gustave. This is a grand scale mystery and comedy about loyalty and those individuals who make an impact along the way. Score: 10 / 10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 November 2014,9/10,"Gustav, the concierge at a hotel situated in the Alps, becomes the centre of suspicion when one of his institution's oldest and richest patrons turns up dead, and she leaves him her most priceless work of art, a Renaissance painting of a boy with an apple. Furious that she left nothing of value to anyone else, the woman's greedy heir uses all manner of underhanded tactics to pin her death on Gustav, and to silence anyone who questions his objectives. This leaves Gustav's trusted lobby boy Zero to clear Gustav's name and prove that the grand lady's killer is none other than her own son......There's so much to say about this film that's already been said, but, I've never really been a fan of Anderson's work up until this. The Life Aquatic was okay, but I found the rest of his work very overrated and a bit of an ordeal to get through.Saying that, after seeing this, I am going to go back and see if I missed something, because this movie is something else, the flow of the narrative is simply sublime, and with so many great performances, it would have been easy for some of the cast to get lost in the mix, but wow, everyone holds their own in this, and Fiennes, wow, he's a comedy genius.But watching the film really does remind you of cake, especially the scenes filmed in the titular hotel, it's as if Anderson has sought inspiration from the actual cakes that Gustav brings back to the hotel.Its a solid movie, very witty, richly narrated, and the cinematography is beautiful."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,8/10,"This quirky story has a magical feel to it. It has a stellar assortment of actors in unexpected roles. Loved the European journey and atmosphere.Ralph Fiennes hasn't had a good original role like this for a while and he takes full advantage of it. Nice to see Ms Ronan in a period role that she is suited to.There are some faults. It could be funnier in parts and the plot doesn't always make much sense but that is the charm of it. Why they were so confrontational with the ""Nazis"" doesn't add up. It would have been better to see more character development with some supporting cast instead of just a brief cameos.It's great that movies like this are a success and there need to be more."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 December 2014,10/10,"Who would have guessed the ideas for this preposterously hilarious film came form the seeds within Stefan Zweig's mind? Well, Wes Anderson is the man about wild ideas and he surpasses his own impressive credits (Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenebaums, Rushmore, etc) with this zany and delightful romp.GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H (Ralf Fiennes, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the wars, and Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the backdrop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent. The big-time cast includes Mathieu Amalric, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Soarise Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban and others. Granted, you must be in a good state of mind to get all the innuendos and in-jokes that fly through this film, but go along for the ride. It is gorgeous to look at, has glorious musical score by Alexandre Desplat, and makes of an evening of escapist fun. Grady Harp, December 14"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,10/10,"An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money, hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless heavy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 October 2015,10/10,"Wes Anderson had created a visual cinematic masterpiece fusing comedy and drama together. With a star studded cast, the story of how a lobby boy became Gustav's best friend and colleague. They have endured a lot together. Ralph Fiennes should have won an Oscar for his performance here. He did a terrific job. The lobby boy named Zero Mustafa also did a terrific job. Every performance is first rate here. The art direction, costumes, and makeup truly deserved their Academy Awards. The movie is just enjoyable all around with a wicked sense of humor all around. This is the kind of film that you enjoy watching repeatedly. It has a wonderful original score. Wes Anderson is best known for large cast and art direction. You want to visit the Grand Budapest Hotel even if it's only make believe."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 December 2018,8/10,"Not being a big fan of Oscar winning movies normally, the year 2015 was a great year for the Oscars. Great movies like The Theory of Everything, Still Alice, The Imitation Game and Interstellar, were all worthy competitors like The Grand Budapest Hotel was. It was a difficult year to chose the best from all those movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel won 4 Oscars and it deserved them all. No Oscars for actors though, and that's because of the quality of the other movies, as Ralph Fiennes did a great job in this movie playing M. Gustave. The young Tony Revolori as Zero, the lobby boy, was also a delight to watch. The rest of the cast, with great names as Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray etc, they all have minor roles but it says enough about the quality of the cast and the movie. Probably Wes Anderson's best as thus far. The movie is very pleasant to watch as it is told in a funny but very structured way. It looks like everybody is walking in a straight stiff line, what gives this movie that something special. The cinematography is also a delight to watch, it's all very horizontal and vertical, every shot is rehearsed until it looks all strangely normal. Not only is it well shot but the story is also captivating enough to keep you amused and entertained. Definitely one of the better movies of that year."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 September 2014,9/10,"You don't just watch THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL. You feast on it. It's got a story that you don't really know where it's going, but there's a great feeling of fulfillment at the movie's end. If you're familiar with Wes Anderson's wholly unique style, then you know what you're getting into here: eye-popping visuals and endearingly quirky characters. The dialogue grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go, and the most hilarious lines come seemingly out of nowhere. It features a gonzo cast, with just a laundry list of talent, and it's almost every few minutes that a familiar face turns up. The colors in this movie are gorgeous, but it's the film's winning sense of humor that won me over. Even the sight of a prison guard being shanked is worth a laugh. And I submit to you that the image of Willem Dafoe hurling a cat out a multi-story window is one for the ages. Just try to remain straight-faced.9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 February 2015,,"a trip more than a show. a homage more than an artistic movie. firework of imagination using a great cast. a delicious movie. maybe, not great but seductive for each flavor of image. a mixture of humor and crime and biographic and social analysis, parable and history lesson, portrait of the XX century and resurrection of childhood moments. a great movie in a very, very special sense. cultural references, Stefan Zweig crumbs of atmosphere, a lost Europe and a surviver and his confession. a film who discovers roots of modern time. in smart manner, with gentle precision. and the smell of a form of holiday. in fact, a form of delight. not real innocent."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 August 2014,7/10,"The concept of this film is visual, there is no real story to it. As one of the characters notes, this world has vanished well before someone thought of making a movie about it. The location, the people, the names, they are all scrambled into something completely fictional, but very recognizable. The plot is just a jumble of stuff that just happens sequentially, but is quite inconsequential. The main character is neither of the great actors who are in the cast, but this too real fictional world that none of us are old enough to remember, but all know.Now, if you are not interested in a new perspective, a well done movie, fantastic actors doing fantastic acting, etc, and instead you are interested in a funny story, some action, some moral in the end, then this is not the film for you. At times the movie is downright boring and nothing really happens. The only genre listed in the IMDb fact sheet is comedy, but except the kind of old mute film filming that might elicit some smiles, with accelerated speed and exaggerated movements, nothing in the film seemed comedic to me. It is not a dark comedy, either. Or it is as much as it is a comedy, I guess.Bottom line: once one sees great actors in the cast, there is a desire to see the movie as it must be better than the average film out there. However, when the number of stars in the cast goes above a limit, you know you are in for some artful stuff. This is an art movie, no doubt about it. Watch it for the art of making a movie, since it was, I believe consciously, cleared of any separate meaning."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 April 2015,7/10,"Despite its title, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is not actually set in Hungary. The film was shot in Germany, but the titular hotel is supposedly located in the fictional Central European Republic of Zubrowka. (Zubrowka? I remember drinking some when I was in Gdansk). The story, an original one but said to be inspired by the works of the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, is told using a complex ""framework technique"". (A particularly Germanic literary device; even in English it is sometimes known by the German name of ""Rahmentechnik""). In 1985 a character known only as The Author relates a story told to him in 1968 by the hotel's owner, one Zero Mustafa. Zero's story relates to his own experiences as a young man in the 1930s. He arrived in Zubrowka as a refugee from his own war-torn Middle Eastern homeland and found employment as a lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, where the hotel concierge, Monsieur Gustave, took him under his wing as his protégé.Their lives were changed for ever when regular guest at the hotel, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, died, leaving Gustave a valuable painting in her will. Her family were most unhappy with this development, especially her son Dimitri Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, and did all they could to prevent Gustave from receiving his legacy. (Zubrowka seems to be an ethnically mixed society; local names are an odd mixture of French, German and Slavic). It transpired that Céline had died of poisoning, and Gustave was arrested, thrown in jail and charged with the crime. The rest of the film deals with Gustave's efforts to escape and clear his name with the assistance of Zero, Zero's girlfriend Agatha and other friends. I was pleasantly surprised by Ralph Fiennes in the key role of Gustave. I have in the past been impressed by Fiennes as a serious actor, especially in villainous or unsympathetic roles such as the Nazi Commandant in ""Schindler's List"", Lord Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" series and the Duke of Devonshire in ""The Duchess"", but I never suspected that he had the comedic skills or lightness of touch necessary for something like this. The film also stars a galaxy of big-name actors from both sides of the Atlantic, some of them such as Jude Law, Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel only appearing in minor roles. Although the dialogue is in English, the film struck me as having more in common with a continental European art-house movie than with a typical production of the American or British cinema. It therefore came as no surprise to discover that although it is officially an American-German- British co-production, features a number of American and British actors and was made by an American director, Wes Anderson, it was financed by German financial companies and film-funding organisations. It is an odd mixture of Sachertorte and strychnine, a Viennese operetta with a libretto by Agatha Christie and made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock. The name of Zero's girlfriend may have been a nod in the direction of the Queen of Crime, and the film's central theme, that of a man wrongly accused of a crime, is classically Hitchcockian. This theme, however, is not treated entirely seriously but rather in the manner of an archly cynical black comedy. The acting is mannered and highly stylised and the sets are both opulent, conjuring up a sense of late Victorian or Edwardian luxury, even though the action ostensibly takes place in 1932, and unrealistic, perhaps suggesting that there was something unreal about the luxury which they symbolise.This sort of thing can be a highly acquired taste, but I must admit that I enjoyed it. Anderson and his cast, especially Fiennes, do enough to ensure that a film could easily have become horribly frivolous, or horribly boring, or both, remains entertaining throughout. It may be a fantasy set in an imaginary Ruritanian country named after a brand of Polish vodka, yet it never loses touch with reality entirely. The scenes of Gustave's wrongful arrest and the scenes towards the end when Zubrowka is preparing for war forcibly remind us that real life in twentieth-century Mitteleuropa was far from being a Ruritanian idyll. 7/10"

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 March 2014,,"""He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace."" about M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).I marvel at how successfully Wes Anderson evokes an era in between wars, the early 1930's of Central and Eastern Europe, in a mythical country, Zubrowka, with a whimsical nostalgia tempered by impending doom for that country and the world as it approaches the Nazis and WWII. Anderson's brilliantly ironic The Grand Budapest Hotel is both light and grave, an admixture of longing for a time that maybe never was or had vanished long before its characters lost it.M. Gustave (Fiennes), the uber concierge of the titular hotel, is the martinet who runs the famous retreat yet the libertine who beds elderly ladies for fun and eventual profit. The will of a certain dowager, Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom he has been sleeping, serves as the catalyst for shenanigans by family and friends as they angle for her inheritance and figuratively the evanescent world of moldy decadence.All the while, moody music perfectly composed by Alexandre Desplat evokes the loss of a time but the promise of a new world. The crayon and pastel colors of diorama-like models are more the fantasies of active imaginations than reality. In other words, Wes Anderson, inspired by Austrian Stefan Zwewig's wry autobiography, The World of Yesterday, has it both ways: a love of times past and a vision of the future, seeded by characters that seem aware of the joys and losses accompanying the contract to live. Although this opulent, decadent menagerie of time may never have existed, Anderson evokes a memory of it not that different from what we remember, for instance, from our youths—my memories are of the halcyon years immediately following WWII. My memories are grand if not real. Anderson remembers like his main character, with illusory grace.The Grand Budapest Hotel is worth a visit, but you can't stay and never could have anyway."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 April 2014,8/10,"I for one have never been a big watcher of the films of Wes Anderson, but I decided to check out his latest ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Mostly because I saw that the film featured an all pro cast, but after watching I was pleased because the film told a story one about the coming of age of a hotel lobby boy and the changing times of an European country. Told mostly thru flashback by an author the film tells the times of one Gustave H(Ralph Fiennes)and his relationship with a hotel lobby boy at a famous European hotel during the time of social change and wars. All of this drama and journey is tied with lust and involves the mystery of a stolen painting tied to a family fortune. And the chemistry and acting of the cast is top notch with F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, and last but not least just to name a few the legendary Bill Murray. Overall good tale of change, suspense and a journey a drama of memories."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 March 2014,8/10,"There is a lot to enjoy in this one. There is a huge cast, some really impressive sets and there is some excellent tung-in-cheek humor. The humor is subtle enough that some patrons might miss it. There is humorist art works. Ralph Finnes carries a lot of this one as the narrator and main character. He has lots of capable support.Saoirse Ronan is perfect as the woman who is Zero's girl friend yet she has very little interaction with him. There is no doubt she is active and needs action but her support shines in this movie.It is said this is a murder mystery within a Comedy. I think it is the other way around, the comedy has the mystery within it. The looks are lavish, the plot ridiculous. Even the prison sequences are short and brisk. Reality is more fantasy in this one, based on an author's works which if they resemble any reality at all would take a vivid imagination. The old hotel has a character brought to life with spirit and a solid cast. With Bill Murray and Jeff Golblum in support too."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 July 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson has been steadfastly honing his finesse since the outset of his career starting from BOTTLE ROCKET (1996) when he was only 27, from then, this wunderkind's filmography has flourished healthily, presently he is among the most successful auteur in US indie ground and internationally his fame also balloons with his audience, his eighth feature THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, this year Berlin International Film Festival's opening film (and Grand Jury Prize winner) and a genuine box-office triumph, indicates he is not slowing down in any aspect. Distinctively utilising 3 aspect ratios for three different time-lines, the predominant storyline in the 30s is in the standard academy ratio, Anderson marshals a bevy of distinguished actors to offer his die-hard devotees a resplendent banquet inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. In a fictional Republic of Zubrowska, located in middle Europe's alpine state, there is the titular hotel, on the cusp of WWII, the concierge Gustave H (Fiennes) and the lobby boy Zero (Revolori) experience a smörgåsbord of incidents fluctuate from an inheritance tumult to a painting theft and to wacky murder cases, from an off-the-wall prison break to a catch-and-chase escapade in a snowfield and finally to a vis-a-vis confrontation in the hotel, it is as kooky as one could ever anticipate in a fashion of Anderson's childlike sophistication, at the same time, the narrative unwinds with absorbing élan in the same class as in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012, 8/10). Anderson's one-of-a-kind varicolored miniatures, opulent design and ingenious compositions again leave his audience in a state of awe and elation, although frequently his back screen projections let the cat out of the reality bag, which vastly has the hallmarks of the standard Hollywood productions, a studio setting grafts on an unconvincing outdoor background. Fiennes is superbly foppish and demonstrates a dynamic interplay with the wide-eyed neophyte Revolori. The pair's friendship is alternately self-consciously comical and heroically heartfelt, Fiennes knows perfectly the timing to deliver his sermon under diverse circumstances, as a dowager-charmer, his lovable goofiness trumps any moral judgment simply because everybody deserves to be happy. Among the massive supporting group, F. Murray Abraham deserves more credits for his compassionate hospitality as the elder Zero in the 1960s and the impassioned narrator (nevertheless how come an Indian boy has metamorphosed into an Arabian grown-up is beyond any explanation); Tilda Swinton is strikingly overshadowed by her old-age make-up although she is always a scene-stealer (even when her character is dead); Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, the love-interest of Zero, an apprentice of the Mendel bakery who has a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her face, she a plucky girl with a sense of righteousness, a symbol of virtue which falls victim of the impending war; last but not the least, Willem Dafoe spices up his menacing goon with equally-dosed grimness and caricature. Principally Anderson underlays a tale of woe with sufficient verve and vibrant palette, more incredibly, he is perfecting his story-telling technique, as a whole, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is his most mature film to date and rosily beckons that the zenith of Wes Anderson school is manifestly on the horizon now."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 September 2015,9/10,"This is a whimsical and meticulously crafted film by Wes Anderson. And I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's one of those films that you just don't want it to end. The design and cinematography of this film is just meticulously and immaculately shot. We Anderson is one of the few directors that has a lot of control over his projects and carries with him, his trademark style. All the actors did a fantastic job with their roles. They really did a great job of bringing the characters to life. I liked the tangled web of hope and disillusionment, faith and cynicism in this story. The character that stands out the most in this is of course the main protagonist Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. He is huberous but a bit delirious as well, charming but a bit manipulative, controlling and fastidious character. He is vain cynical person that isn't entirely likable, but has my sympathy. In another words, he is a flawed hero in this story that has the characteristics of a quick-witted fox. I first thought most of the story will revolve around characters in a hotel and how they go about it. However it turns out this is a immaculate caper film. Overall, this is a hysterical adventure I wouldn't mind seeing again. 9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,9/10,"'THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Wes Anderson directed and co-wrote (with Hugo Guinness) this all-star comedy film about a popular European concierge trying to clear his name of murder, with the aid of a recently employed lobby boy (who has become his closest friend). The story is set between the two world wars and was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig (a famous Austrian writer during the 1920s and 30s). The film stars Ralph Fiennes as the concierge and Tony Revolori as his lobby boy friend. It also features performances by Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan. Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray and many others. I found it to be quite funny and visually interesting but not up to par with Anderson's best films. Fiennes plays M. Gustave; a concierge at a once famous European hotel (in the fictional Zubrowka), during the height of it's popularity (between the two world wars). Tony Revolori plays Zero Moustafa, a recently hired lobby boy who Gustave quickly takes a liking to. Gustave was well liked by the hotel's richest guests (for his excellent customer service), especially older blonde women (who he made sure got all their needs met). When one such regular guest passes on, named Madame D. (Swinton), Gustave is left a very valuable Renaissance painting. This causes quite a controversy with Madame D.'s family, especially her son Dmitri (Brody), and Gustave soon finds himself imprisoned for the Madame's murder. He then must rely on Zero to help him clear his name. F. Murray Abraham plays Zero as an adult (at a much later time), who narrates the story. The movie has Anderson's usual quirky style, humor and offbeat characters. It also has some deeper emotional drama (like his other films) but not at the same level as his greatest work and the characters aren't quite as likable or memorable either. It is really funny, highly amusing and full of great performances (especially Fiennes); like all of Anderson's other movies too. Without that same level of human touch though (as Anderson's best) I can't recommend it quite as much. I'm sure fans of his will be extremely entertained though; as well as fans of any of the actors involved.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 October 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson's latest cinematic confection, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" is a quirky, surrealistic comedy set at a mountain resort run by a concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and a ""lobby boy"" named Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori), whom M. Gustave has taken under his wings to train in the art of service. Set in a fictional country, the movie begins in 1968, when the Grand Budapest Hotel is just a shadow of its former self, having been allowed to fall into disrepair and currently inhabited by a small contingent of eccentric tenants. One of them is a writer (Tom Wilkinson) who discovers that Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) is now the owner of the once-proud establishment. The elder Mustafa regales him with stories of an earlier time in the hotel's history - the 1930s, in fact - when the palatial inn played host to only the richest and most aristocratic of occupants and guests. Through dual-narrated flashbacks, then, Anderson weaves a smart and cheeky tale of an enduring friendship that triumphs over class division, a tale that combines wit with imagination and social commentary with visual elegance, set against the writer/director's trademarked air of heightened unreality. When he isn't fulfilling his duties as hotel concierge, the foppish M. Gustave, fastidious in manner and with a poetic quote for every occasion, offers his ""personal"" services exclusively to blond, fabulously wealthy and emotionally insecure dowagers, one of whom bequeaths to him a priceless painting upon her sudden death. This surprising turn-of-events puts him at odds with a veritable army of the deceased woman's outraged relatives. This leads to a stolen art treasure, a false conviction for murder, a daring prison break and a mad race to stay one step ahead of the pursuing authorities, as M. Gustave endeavors to prove his innocence.To enhance the dreamlike nature of the material, the look of the film is marked by whimsical art direction and ultra-stylized framing. Even the dimensions of the screen change with the time period of the story - traditional square for the scenes set in 1932 and widescreen for those that take place in 1968.In addition to the splendid deadpan performances of Fiennes, Abraham and newcomer Revolori in the key roles, the movie provides a veritable sea of familiar faces in supporting and bit parts, many of them members of Anderson's repertory company: Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson, among others. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" finds Mr. Anderson in peak form."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 October 2018,4/10,"My fondness for Royal Tennenbaums combined with the critical acclaim and distinct look of Wes Anderson's movies always sucks me in, but I've regretted every Anderson film I've watched from Darjeeling Limited on, and Budapest Hotel is no exception.I can't say a lot about the plot because I saw the movie on a red-eye and slept through the middle. From what I saw it's about a man who inherits a painting and has some trouble about it.The man is played by Ralph Fiennes and he is terrific as a cool, quick-witted, unflappable character. His dialogue is sharp and funny. The movie overall is pleasantly goofy.,So why didn't I like it? Well ...Some movies engage and draw in the viewer. Some movies try to do that a fail. But Budapest Hotel strives to distance the viewer as much as possible. Characters are filmed at a distance and speak in rapid-fire patter that never achieves the warm quirky charm you get from patter-classics like The Front Page or Bringing Up Baby. The movie feels like a clever experimental short built around the concept of people in a dollhouse and stretches it out forever. Everything in this screams out FORMAL EXPERIEMENT; nothing screams out CARE ABOUT THIS.Would I have enjoyed this movie more if I'd not been so sleepy? Maybe a little. I might have found this a more almost-fun movie like Fantastic Mr. Fox rather than an increasingly annoying one like Moonrise Kingdom. But ultimately I find all of Anderson's later films are quirk-heavy stylistic exercises that leave me cold, and there was nothing in what I saw of Hotel to make me believe my reaction wide awake would have differed much from my reaction half asleep.So this is it. No matter how the critics rave, Budapest will be my last Anderson movie. For those of you who like this sort of thing, ENJOY!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 August 2021,7/10,"As a film, this makes for a great poster. Director Anderson's picaresque caper centres on Ralph Fiennes as the all-powerful hotel manager M. Gustave, who runs the Grand Hotel Budapest in the between the wars period with a forensic eye for detail and a metronomic precision for timing.We're introduced to him by the rather unnecessary framing device of a present-day (well, the 60's anyway) meeting at the now run-down old hotel between the mysterious current owner, who's popped back to look in on the old place, but who back in the 30's was a lowly trainee lobby boy whose given name Zero added up to his total credentials for the job in the hotel granted to him by Gustave, and a curious, if stuffy newspaper columnist, played by Jude Law.So we enter into a flashback sequence which runs pretty much to the end of the movie as M Gustave takes centre-stage. He is the quintessential concierge-cum-maitre D and master of all he surveys at the hotel, given to outbursts of loquacious poetry while at other times he can organise his staff with a brief word or gesture, while, when under pressure he breaks into expletive-littered utterances. On the side, M Gustave cultivates relationships with elderly blonde widows with considerable means, even to the extent of bedding them, eyeing as he does so a future payday when they duly expire and invariably find a place in their wills for him, much to the chagrin of the disappointed and surprised family members.The plot here concerns one especially wealthy duchess played by Tilda Swindon, who leaves a priceless painting to him in a deathbed codicil to her will. Uncertain if he'll be allowed to ever receive it, Gustave decides to attend the wake and simply walk off with the painting soon after the reading of the will and try to take it by train back to the hotel, with young Zero in tow as his accomplice and gopher.The inclusion of the words Grand and Hotel in the title can't be coincidence, with the film also set at almost the exact year of release of the vintage classic Hollywood le-ronde 1932 movie starring Garbo, Barrymore, Crawford et. Al. Thus we see several big-names sprinkled throughout the cast in unusual roles like Willem Defoe as a psychopathic, motorbiking hit-man after Gustave, Jeff Goldblum as the Duchess's executor who loses both his cat and four of his fingers in the pursuit of his duties and Adrien Brody as the Duchess's aggrieved moustachioed son who leads the chasing pack against Gustave. Elsewhere Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel amongst others pop up too.It's all very absurd and farcical with Anderson's remarkable eye for colour and design obvious in almost every shot. As frantically paced as a vintage Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd comedy, every scene gives the eye something to marvel at although those of us who appreciate continuity, character development and a less frenetic pacing might suffer in the search.Fiennes is terrific as the great if greedy M Gustave and shows fine comic timing throughout while young Revolori shines as his indispensable errand boy. The set design throughout is a joy to behold while there's a fun, simpatico soundtrack which helps to keep the action moving frantically along and if I didn't quite succumb to the scatterbrain, all-points-west narrative or see any great moral point behind all the flashiness and high-jinks, that's probably down to my middle-aged stuffiness.Definitely one to see at the cinema for the large-screen experience, I almost guarantee you'll feel like you've been stuck in the hotel's revolving doors after viewing it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 June 2014,9/10,"I think I've seen a few Wes Anderson movies and I know his reputation for being very eccentric and quirky in his films. Its not usually my cup of tea but after experiencing The Grand Budapest Hotel I might have to re-address the opinion and watch some more of his work. I'm not a big fan of comedy, least of all dirty, raunchy stupid comedy but this comedy was like nothing I have ever seen and it turns out was right up my alley. Make no mistake, this is a comedy. This is the sort of zany, outrageous comedy that made Monte Python an iconic group. The story makes perfect sense and is not confusing in the least and yet this incredibly bizarre cast of characters in an incredibly outrageous series of events feels completely surreal. Its just some of the most random things happening and yet you're laughing and shaking your head at the insanity of it all. In addition to that this was easily one of the most visually stunning, colourful, and outrageous set design I have ever seen. This ""faux"" European backdrop turns this into the ultimate fairy tale for adults. The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been an Oscar contender if not for visual style than just how incredibly unique it is. This proves that there are still some original ideas kicking around in Hollywood and Wes Anderson deserves mounds of credit.Ralph Fiennes is talented...we all know that. He's never really been a favourite of mine, I just always thought he was okay. He is comedy gold in this. Gustave H. will go down in my personal books as one of the greatest comedy characters ever. He is completely outrageously manic and ridiculous and has this air of sophistication about him. It was a brilliant, brilliant performance. ""I'm afraid that's me darling."" Poor Tony Revolori is hardly mentioned and is fully a main character in the film. He gets buried under the crowd of big names performing with him. But he shouldn't be ashamed because he is brilliant in this as well. He plays lobby boy ""Zero."" Him and Fiennes play so well off of each other and he's sort of the straight man to the story and just performs so well. You will quickly find yourself endeared by him. I honestly wish I had ten pages to talk about all the characters in this. You will recognize so many faces as amazing character actors. But some have bigger roles than others (Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law are just sort of there.) But the true magic of this supporting cast is in the small roles that make a big impact. Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton (loved his role!) and Saoirse Ronan stood out to me in a big way. Small roles but a lot of fun and very effective in their performances. The cast just jives and works so well in the confines of this amazingly unique script.I guess what I'm saying is that I am now a Wes Anderson fan. This is a feat of film making period. It is the furthest thing from mainstream and it won't even remotely be everyone's thing. I didn't think it would be mine either. Since the first moment I saw the trailer, something called out to me. This looks zany and stupid and foolish and I kind of want to see it. Its not stupid or foolish. Film critics should love it, fans of something different should adore it. This could easily sneak its way into my favourite movies category and slip its way to being a perfect ten after a few more views. It is also chock full of amazing one liners, brilliantly written slapstick comedy and I will be quoting for the rest of my life. Want something completely outside the box? Wes Anderson doesn't even use the vicinity of the box when he made this and it is all good!! 9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2017,9/10,"In a fictional country whose name might earn 100 points on the Scrabble, one of these typical points in the map that started the century in the Austrian-Hungarian splendor and ended up in Soviet austerity, there is a hotel. In this hotel that used to be the place-to-be to all the visitors from Europe, there was a professional, no-nonsense but not without a debonair quality of his own, concierge, his name was Gustav. He had a lust for aging blonde socialites, and from the way he explains it, it's something that requires the taste of a gourmet.There's also a timid but motivated lobby boy named Zero, a baker named Mendl, a murder, a jail sentence, inheritance, family plots and many other ingredients of a real pastry of movie whose story and tone will get over the heads of those who expect something with a plot. Well, that's not what the film is about, it has the old-fashioned charm of Golden Age Hollywood movies, but with a sense of self-conscious wit that gives it a modern touch of originality. It is weird, it is old, you wouldn't believe this is a 2014 movie but like Gustav' tastes, it takes a gourmet to appreciate it.There's something delightfully refreshing in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" in the way it doesn't call for any particular analysis, and provides nothing that can encourage your mind to venture into intellectual considerations. This film is meant for pure visual and narrative entertainment and all you have to do is imagining yourself checking in a hotel where all your wishes will be granted, you don't even have to think, it's all in the 'wait and see' premise.There's also a leitmotif in the film consisting on a delicious pastry, from renowned baker Mendl, who looks and tastes good and is so appealing in any way that when it is sent to a jail pensioner, the man in charge of checking if there's no outbreak device hidden in food, doesn't even let his butcher knife spoil the visuals. This is almost a metaphor to Wes Anderson's aesthetic power, one you don't want to butcher with 'thinking'. You don't need and you shouldn't, because if you try, you're likely to find yourself in some sort of private joke you're the only one not to get.So, embrace that big joke of a film, that shaggy-dog story where each shot, looks like the vignette of a comic-book, enjoy the dry with of Ralph Fiennes in his greatest comedic performance since ""In Bruges"" and don't take the whole thing seriously. The only serious aspect about it is that the film is a visual masterpiece with a unique use of colors, contrasts and environment shots, Anderson is a director, who like Jeunet in ""Amélie"" knows how to make people move in an environment, whether a hotel lobby, a jail or a mountain. Actually, he even know how to make them static, in the middle of a frame, looking at the camera but never breaking the fourth wall, quite a stunt, really.Other moments come in mind, an exchange of punches that look like the frame never moves yet three or four guys end up on the floor, there's a suspenseful moment over a ravine where a man breaks the ice to make Gustav fall only to be thrown away and fall while spinning like in a Tex Avery cartoon. The juxtapositions between shots is another trick cherished by Anderson, a group of escaping prisoners look down over a hole they just opened, the next shot features the exact opposite with guards. I mentioned comic-books, the film's story board would have made a terrific one. The uses of costume is another aspect that immediately associates the film with the animated world, nothing is too wacky or over-the-top if it means a great-looking shot or a hilarious gag, or both.The film is also known for his ensemble star-cast and indeed, it's part of the publicity, it would take a whole paragraph to list all the actors, but the thing is that the film owes them nothing, they're giving their best shot even for a few minutes of screen-time (Bill Murray doesn't have more than a minute but he steals that minute) because they know the film is good enough to have fun with it. It was Ebert who mentioned in his show with Siskel that there was nothing better than seeing actors having fun with their characters, the film would highlight that 'fun' aspect. We know actors love rely on disguises, phony accents and go beyond their usual method acting just to make fun of their own shtick. That's how refreshing the tone of Anderson is. The film would garner 11 Oscar nominations, the most with ""Birdman"" but not one for acting. Fair enough.And as star-studded as it is, Anderson was wise enough to cast a relatively unknown young fellow (Tony Rivelori) for the central role of awkward lobby boy Zero (his old counterpart is played by F. Murray Abraham), Zero doesn't have any physical appeal, he's not even competent, but he's totally devoted to his Master Gustav and that is the key to their relationship, he's his eyes and ears during his absence in prison and together, they lead a heart-pounding adventure with the dawn of the War as a backdrop. Their relationship, which is one of the mentor and master can be very inspiring at time, even poignant, so maybe there are a few things to appreciate beyond the zaniness, after all.But apart from that, it's a film that can be tasted like a treat and full of tricks whose only purpose is to make you laugh, the whole thing wrapped up in a sumptuous visual package à la Anderson, a cinematic Mendl. ""The Grand Budapest"" is all about intellectual detachment, visual entertainment, and fun, fun and fun, tricks and treats, really."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 December 2020,8/10,"Wes Anderson's quirky, Oscar-nominated 'The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)' is inarguably his best work. It's a thoroughly entertaining experience that's almost as funny as it is distinct. With its pastel colour palate, pseudo 'silent movie' sets and purposefully dry dialogue, the piece creates its own unique yet cohesive style that almost seeps off the screen. There's nothing quite like it. It's a tangible and twee little tale that constantly subverts expectation. It's often incredibly funny (a moment in a monastery is straight-up side-splitting) and it remains good-humoured from start to finish. It also packs a surprising amount of emotional heft, especially as it approaches its ending. It's just a fun time, really. It's chock full of spot-on performances, set-pieces and plot-points. It's great. 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 September 2017,5/10,"I have to admit I don't understand the appeal of Wes Anderson's films. It's not just that I don't like them very much - I'm not a great fan of superhero movies either, but I can comprehend the sensibility that they appeal to. But Anderson's movies, so widely feted, leave be not only cold, but mystified. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', for example, conjures up beautifully a comically rendered vision of Mitteleuropean splendour fading into Nazism and communism in a way that should appeal to me. But in that world, Anderson tells a one-note story devoid of any human depth. To contrast, consider a movie like 'Delicatessan', for example, which is also set in a tragi-comic alternative world; but which tells a story full of very real emotion. To me, the richness of that movie's reality is light years away from the complete shallowness of Anderson's work. As I said, it's as if there's something that's sailing completely over my head; either that, or there's an audience completely unconcerned by the absence of substance. But I'm not part of it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson makes films that aren't like the films of anyone else. That may or may not be a good thing, depending on whether you 'get' them. I've always felt his films were like live action versions of the cartoons in 'The New Yorker'; sometimes they're funny, most of the time they're clever and always they seem to be designed for the intelligentsia. Perhaps that's why Wes Anderson's films don't make lots of money or win Oscars. Even the 'intellectual' New York comedies of Woody Allen have a wider appeal, not that their films have a great deal in common except, perhaps, their 'smartness'. Although ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has secured a multiplex release I doubt if it will wow them in Des Moines which is a pity since this is a film of considerable charm and a good deal of wit. OK, it's hardly laugh-out-loud funny but I had a silly grin on my face from start to finish. Like all his films it's set in what we might call 'Andersonland', a totally fabricated country made up of scraps from his favourite fiction, in this case the writings of Stefan Zweig who gets a special dedication at the end. It's literary in that words matter a great deal and play an important part in the development of the story and it's a film in which stories are crucial, (it's divided, like a novel, into chapters). Indeed, the story that makes up the body of the film is told as a story within a story begun by elderly author Tom Wilkinson informing us of how he first met the owner of the The Grand Budapest Hotel many years before when we was a young writer, (played by Jude Law), and the owner was an old man, (an excellent F Murray Abraham), who in turn tells the story of when he was a mere lobby boy, (newcomer Tony Revolori), under the tutelage of the hotel's concierge and the films central character, M Gustave, (a superb comic performance from Ralph Fiennes). It's when we get back to this point in time that the dimensions of the screen change from today's customary widescreen to the box-like dimensions of '30's cinema. It's as if Anderson is paying tribute, not just to writers like Zweig, but to film-makers like Ernst Lubitsch as this is a Ruritanian romance set in the kind of Mitteleuropa so beloved of Lubitsch and others of the period. All it lacks are the characters periodically bursting into song. If the film doesn't quite live up to its predecessors such as ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" or ""The Life Aquatic"" I think it's because there's no emotional commitment to the characters, It's too skittish, too self- consciously smart to draw us in. On the other hand it looks amazing. The hotel itself is like a giant cake that the baker in the film, M Mendl, might have made, and then there's always that extraordinary cast to keep us entertained. The film reads like a Who's Who, not just of Anderson regulars, but of moviedom's best character actors. None of them are, of course, remotely 'realistic', not even Fiennes. They remain the stock characters we find in those 'New Yorker' cartoons but they remain good company nevertheless. One thing is guaranteed, of course; you won't find anything else like it, at least not until Anderson makes his next movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,8/10,"Cakes made at the Mendl's patisserie play an important role in this film. They are sweet round things, with an appetizing and improbable shape and pastel colors which emanate sugar. They are made by a sweet girl and delivered to the Grand and Imaginary Budapest hotel on the peak of the mountains of an Europe that ceased to exist, or maybe never existed but in the imagination of writer Stefan Zweig and later taken over, amplified and brought to screen and to us by director Wes Anderson. A reverence to a world of beauty and aesthetics, of culture and respect, of honor and pleasure of living which is crushed by history, same as the world of Jewish Austrian writer Stefan Zweig was in the events of the second world war.The story written by Wes Anderson freely develops the themes and atmosphere of Zweig's writings without being specifically based on any one, in a fantasy which extends beyond the historic boundaries of the life and works of writer. Europe survived the war but could not recover its history, its style, it's human quality. If buildings survived they are condemned to decay, if men survived they are reduced to their shady selves. What is left is to remember the world that was - now retreated back in a past that looks more and more like a fairy tale. And fairy tale is what we are served on the screen, albeit a very fun and entertaining ones, and there are many reasons to like this picture even without philosophizing too much about its deeper meanings.One of these reasons is of course the cast - one of these exquisite gathering of stars that usually get together only on the Academy Awards night. Shining over all is Ralph Fiennes in the lead role, and I will stop here but I ensure you that even if you recognize some of the faces you will find out that most of them do something different and in a different manner that you always knew (Edward Norton may be the notorious exception). Second is the amazing visual world created by Anderson which coupled with the camera work gives the viewers sometimes a 3-D feeling (although no special spectacles are involved), and in other cases seems to play with the dimensions of the rectangular screen extending them at will. Third and neither last nor least the settings contribute to passing to viewers the flavors of well-being of the times that went away.Stefan Zweig did not survive the war. When the world he loved crumbled crushed under the boots of the Barbarians he committed suicide. This film can be read like some kind of revenge. At least in the fantasy space created on screen by Wes Anderson a world similar in feeling, manners, colors, smells and tastes to the one Zweig loved survives. A world like Mendl's cakes. Almost poisonously sweet."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 June 2014,7/10,"I have only seen a few Wes Anderson films and I still haven't understood the tremendous love people give him. His style is vastly different from anything in Hollywood right now but I cant help but think of a film like Dr. Strangelove as an inspiration for Andersons career. Now obviously when I say I haven't understood the love for his films doesn't mean I don't like them. I thought Moonrise Kingdom was extremely interesting and unique, as is The Grand Budapest Hotel. But as far as a movie-going experience I just don't think his style fits my liking.With that said, I think he always gets the most out of his actors. Especially in certain comedic moments I think the performances are fantastic. The film can be outrageous at times but its when the film becomes self aware that it really shines. There's something about movies that know they can be crazy and play off of it that separate it from other movies. The film also has many dark comedic moments such as just shaking off deaths without thinking twice. Dark comedy really only works when you have actors that can sell the moment. Ralph Fiennes was perfect for Gustave and I'm sure will be considered come award season.Even though the movie is only 100 minutes long, it does drag at certain moments and I found myself drifting for a few moments. The overwhelming amount of celebrity cameos were cool but most only felt like it was just the actor acting. Owen Wilson was much too easily recognizable to my liking but Dafoe and Murray were great in the small but crucial roles. Might you ask what the point of the film was? Well it seems to be about trying to find the last remaining glimpses of hope left in humanity and Gustave was one of the few left who loved people and believed in them.+Fiennes was spectacular+how many great actors in one film?+dark comedy-drags at times-some celebrities were too easily recognizable7.5/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 June 2014,,"This is only the third Wes Anderson film I've seen, but I loved the other two (Fantastic Mr. Fox and moonrise Kingdom). The distinct voice and style that he put in those films is very present here, but for some reason it just didn't connect with me nearly as much. The production design, the music, the visual imagery, it's all rather amazing, should get a ton of Oscar nominations in the technical categories... but while I did enjoy the film to a degree, it also felt detached. It felt like I was watching with a wall in between, so while I could very much appreciate it and even enjoy it, it feels like I should've loved it even more. Only rewatches will determine just how much I will take to it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 February 2015,9/10,"Every time I hear a new Wes Anderson movie is coming out, I get giddy with glee. I love the works of this amazing auteur, especially his last feature, Moonrise Kingdom. This movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is an excellent, stylish film set in the world of Anderson. The film is bright, colorful, and features exquisite cinematography as well as a delightful score from Alexandre Desplat-which finally got him his first Oscar. This film is funny as well with a great screenplay, which worked thanks to the amazing cast. Anderson's latest film is about a hotel concierge named Gustave who befriends a lobby boy named Zero and together they go on adventures. Gustave must rely upon Zero to help solve a murder in which he has been framed all over the account of a family inheritance. When this film has a big cast, I mean this film has a big cast. However, many of them don't get long chunks on the screen. Ralph Fiennes does very well as Gustave and his performance was just a laugh riot. Tony Revolori as the lobby boy also received points in my book as Gustave's new friend. The rest of the cast is just too large to list, but I particularly liked Harvey Keitel as Gustave's fellow escape plotter and Jeff Goldblum as the family's attorney. Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel will appeal to everyone who is a fan of Wes Anderson. His style of filmmaking is unique and I adore the way he creates inventive ways to create movies. Not only is the story and acting excellent, the movie features strong technical talent. Tilda Swinton and her makeup is just one example. The movie is fast-paced and often funny, so I am glad this film was recognized by the Academy!My Grade: A"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 June 2014,,"When it comes to director Wes Anderson, there is only one thing that's present everywhere in every one of his works that makes his films all the more unique; the eccentricity. But more on that later. Set in the fictional Republic of Zubrowska, The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the adventures of Monsieur Gustave H, the charming & devoted concierge of the famed hotel who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he's framed for the murder of one of hotel's most regular guests.Those who are accustomed to this director's previous works know that his films present an immensely distinct visual flair that's seamlessly blended with quirky wit, eclectic dialogues & idiosyncratic characters to give its viewers a bizarre cinematic experience. And his latest feature is no different as it's very emblematic of his style, has a tremendous charm to it, is exquisitely photographed, finely edited & peculiarly scored by Alexandre Desplat.Coming to the performances, The Grand Budapest Hotel features a stellar cast in which each actor is assigned an odd character to play on the screen & is introduced to the viewers in Anderson's usually unusual style. But it's Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H whose stylish appearance, rapid-fire delivery & dry wit ended up making the biggest impression. The next best for me was Willem Dafoe who ends up delivering a cold-blooded performance as a cold-blooded assassin.On an overall scale, The Grand Budapest Hotel bears all the signatures of a Wes Anderson's feature & maybe even more. It's arguably his most accessible work to date that's exquisitely designed & elegantly composed. It's like a delicious dessert course that is delicately served to its viewers & is one of this year's sweetest, quirkiest, funniest & most enjoyable films as of now. So just leave your doubts behind & check into The Grand Budapest Hotel, as soon as possible.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2015,,"At the same time as the Coens have hit a snag in visual imagination and the ability to roam freely, Wes Anderson soars. This has all the lithe irreverence of early Coens, the paradox of Lubitsch, with the self-reference of Greenaway back when he was still making ripples.The structure could be out of Greenaway and tuned to much the same purpose, nested fiction so that we can move to a broader view of life that includes the stage where it acts its dramas - narrators nested within narrators, a girl reading a book by an author who narrates about an encounter he had with another narrator, who narrates over dinner about his escapades with a master storyteller caught in a fiction.Deep down it's the encounter with this master storyteller that matters, a concierge in a hotel, superficially frilly at first sight, but someone we come to realize who cultivates the entire space of the hotel with a storyteller's affection for the contours of duplicitous life, who knows when to gently hover, when to anticipate and direct, when to throw himself earnestly in the creation of memorable f(r)iction for his elderly patrons.The fiction he's caught in and sends him to prison and eventually all the way up to a monastery in the Alps is where he's framed by greedy relatives for murder. Its own commentary on art and narrative that again recalls the sardonic best of Greenaway in Draughtsman - the storyteller framed by boorish patrons who can only imagine a boorish story, lecherous gigolo exploiting vulnerable old women. We know from our position as viewers that he was a character in a fiction spun for her enjoyment and thrill (and his profit of course), but spun in earnest, with genuine care.And this is what Anderson does as storyteller of the whole thing. Spinning obvious fiction shown to be artificial on all sides (one that we enter through a book), but doing it with earnest love for the snowflakes of truth he can elicit on every step. I find here a succulent love between human beings that I first admired in the teenage romance of his Moonrise - as dry and static was Life of Zissou, so much richer these last two films have been. On the whole I'm beaming after this, which I saw twice in as many days. It's such a pleasure to watch Anderson bloom in this way - this is surely his mature period and after the sublime Moonrise he's become for me one to cherish and keep an eye on.The controlled symmetries have been toned down, they're still here, but gone is the coffee shop lassitude, replaced by a dynamic asymmetry first introduced in Moonrise - between what we see and what what is narrated or what we imagine, like the image of prisoners feet dancing in air above the sleeping wardens, a poetic image that hovers for a brief second until the next one explains it. There's a magnetic pace here that comes as a result of paradoxically dismantling expectation - Lubitsch. This along with how music is melded to it merits its own viewing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 October 2018,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel definitely has that quirky charm that we've all come to expect from Wes Anderson movies. The dialogue is quick and the humor is brisk during this flashback within a flashback within a flashback. Plus, it's impossible to dislike Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of unflinching propriety in the face of disagreeable circumstances. This is probably in my top three Wes Anderson movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 February 2015,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.I haven't been a huge fan of some of the previous films I've seen by Wes Anderson,I understand that he is a very creative and unique film maker,but his directing style is just a little too weird for me,but it didn't bother me with this movie,it is just hilarious,looney and it never would have been this much fun had it not been for Wes Andersons very talented mind,it's certainly my favourite film I've seen from him to date and I will have to check out some more of his work.The cast is absolutely superb,with many of Andersons usual cast members as well as some new faces,but none of them manage to take the spotlight away from Ralph Fiennes,Mr Gustave is a very different character who I found absolutely charming,his dialogue was outstanding and I've never been so taken away by Fiennes as an actor before,certainly one of his finest characters and I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role,his dialogue with newcomer Tony Revolori was spectacular and one of the movies highlights,they worked together so well.I felt like the movie certainly could have been longer,it is very quick and fun which certainly wasn't an issue,but another forty minutes of this wouldn't have been a problem either.A very fun ride that never stops being interesting,there is certainly nothing like the Grand Budapest Hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure film. The adventures of a hotel concierge and his lobby boy as they take part in a battle for a family fortune after the robbery of a very rare painting. Best Performance: Ralph Fiennes"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2014,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)Stunning at every turn, and yet...well...it lacks something, too, that left me happy but unsatisfied.As usual with a Wes Anderson movie, the amazing sets and set design win the day. Sometimes this combines with a little magic in a movie to lift the result up beautifully, as in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (which I loved). Here there are certainly moments that work but many others that simply reside. The main character played by Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully proper and funny.Plot? A forced fairy tale of a story keeps the narration moving through several distinct parts, but the main idea is that an old man is explaining to a younger patron of the dying hotel how he came to own it. And those events happened to him as a bellboy back when the hotel was truly grand. The fact this is narrated is part of the package, but it keeps everything at that distance Anderson prefers.What it lacks oddly is magic, the one thing a fairy tale like this demands. There are lots of deliberate (and good) clichés at work—a stolen painting, a mysterious patron, an unexplained death—and there is the scene itself, this glorious old hotel both in its seedy later years and in its heyday. And though there are delights, and witty lines, at every turn, there is a feeling of just watching it, never quite getting involved. Maybe that's deliberate, but if so, it still left me a bit restless at times.What about all the stars in this overpacked cast? Well, you can tell they are in it for the pleasure of it, taking on comic book kinds of roles. But there is a disappointment there, too, because too often it seems that each star appears for their own sake, and her or his fame, not for the edge it gives their character. The most obvious case is Bill Murray, who appears in a dull role for all of about 20 seconds of screen time. At the other extreme is Willem Defoe, who is delectably evil all through in his major role. Jude Law makes a decent foil (listener) to the narrator, played well enough by F. Murray Abraham, but both men never shine. They sit and talk, after all.And so it goes. Which takes us back to the sets. Wow. Unbelievable at every turn. The hotel is superb, and likewise the expansive mansion of the murdered woman, and likewise even the train car which appears more than once. It's a wonderfully made movie on all these technical levels, including some flashy, tricky photography that is playful in its wide and then close views. See it? Sure, if you are predisposed. There no hating this movie, for sure. Which is high praise."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 November 2016,8/10,"I haven't seen this movie properly the first time but when it was showing on RTE 2 and I wasn't busy, I was like sure why not? Omg there was so many funny scenes on this film that I couldn't think of them properly. I know the funniest scene I won't forget was when the lobby Indian guy pushed the bad guy Serge X when he nearly killed Ralph Fienne's character by stopping his foot to the ice glacier. I know it was rather grim but seriously, it was just rather sudden!I couldn't believe but rather glad that there were so many famous stars on this like Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux,Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. Seriously, i say they gave each star a million bucks for being involved in this! All were brilliant anyways!I love the designs on the Budapest hotel, it was just so fascinating and very colourful! No wonder this film got 4 Oscars, it really deserved it! I give this movie a 8/10 because its really really good."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 August 2021,8/10,"In this delightful adventure, we witness how people fight for their own interests, regardless of the changing age around the evolving relationship between Gustave and Zero. Especially the director Wes Anderson's presentation of the story to the audience in an imaginary world was a very appropriate work. Thus, while watching the film, we get nothing but what the director wants to give us. Otherwise, the script would have become vulgar in terms of locations and characters. I don't have much to say about the presentation of the movie. While watching the movie, there is a constant escapism and a constant chase... Different places while being dragged from place to place... I can't help but highlight the places. While watching the movie, I felt as if we were moving our lips a little and inhaling the smell emanating from the pages while reading a book, and as I said, this feeling reached its peak especially in the descriptions of the place. With a large and experienced cast, you will feel the intimacy and the warm bond between Gustave and Zero as you witness the adventures that develop around enormous locations. It is a movie that will make your eyes happy with a visual feast."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2014,9/10,"In the country of Zubrowka, on the continent of Europe, a former lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero (F. Murray Abraham as an older man, Tony Revolori as a young man) is telling his story to a famous writer (Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson at various ages). This inn, now fallen on hard times, was once a lavishly beautiful place of accommodation for the wealthy and famous. In truth, Zero's former boss at the establishment, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was one of the primary reasons for the GB's phenomenal success. This meticulous man courted the rich ladies and gents and met their every needs. But, perhaps, he did his job too well. One unhappy day, the supremely rich Madame D (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves a valuable painting to M. Gustave. This sets off a ferocious row for the lady's family, especially for her eldest, nasty Dimitri (Adrien Brody). As M. Gustave and Zero ""lifted"" the painting after the funeral, Dimitri send his henchman, Joplin (Willen Dafoe) after anybody who stands in the way of the painting's recovery, including their loyal lawyer (Jeff Goldblum). M. Gustave is even thrown in prison for awhile but makes just the right sort of pals inside, ones who can spring him out with their smarts and bravado (including Harvey Keitel). But, even after this happenstance, M Gustave and Zero are chased, up mountains, through fields and down dark alleys. Helping them is Zero's girlfriend, Agatha (Saorsie Ronan), and a large group of fellow hotel workers. Could there even be a new will that might cut Dimitri out completely? Who will triumph in the end? This grand and amazing film is a treasure for those who long for films of imagination, cleverness, and courage. To be honest, GBH falls a bit short of ten stars but certainly merits nine. To begin, its scale is incredible, with a dream cast and a mountainous setting that is breathtaking. Among the cast, its hard to pick favorites, but Fiennes, Goldblum, Keitel, Brody and Dafoe were most impressive to me, as well as the youngster, Revolori. One could add that they had the most ""showy"" roles, while the rest did very well indeed in their quieter parts. Also, the art direction, costumes, script, story, and frenetic direction also score huge points for dazzle, even though they sometimes fall a wee whisker short. All in all, how can anyone who loves film really resist the chance to see this one? They don't make em like this much anymore!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2014,7/10,"""I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered and you think I did it."" Gustave H (Fiennes) is a concierge at the legendary Grand Budapest Hotel. He is the best at what he does and receives respect from everyone. After one of his frequent guests dies she leaves him a rare and expensive painting in her will. When it turns out that he is the prime suspect in her death him and his young protégé set off on an adventure avoiding the cops and trying to find the real killer. Wes Anderson is one of the most original directors to come along but most people either love or hate his work. This one will do nothing to change that. He just isn't a main stream type guy and that's OK. Much like Woody Allen he has a niche and plays that up. There isn't really much else to say about this one. If you like Wes Anderson movies you will like this one, if you don't you won't. Overall, Anderson's movies keep getting better (although I liked Rushmore the most) but they are still really only for a select few. I did like this though. I give it a B."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 June 2014,8/10,"Whether the hotel rooms' sets came from custom set design; cgi; or actual filming locations it was all jaw dropping engaging in its opulence. The film showcases that period between wars in eastern Europe when fortunes rapidly rose only to just as rapidly dissipate. We follow those fortunes and lifestyles through the guests, workers and others whose lives intersect with the hotel's rise & fall. Not only the sets, but the props and costuming were all period appropriate first rate. The painted mat backdrop for the hotel gave an other-worldly fantastical feel to the film's locality. On the downside the script itself was uneven - not polished thus not comfortably easy for a viewer to get hooked into the plot's digressions. The acting, on the other hand, was superb. It completely sold that not-quite- real fantasy feel to the story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel Instead of robes, hotels should offer guests complimentary HAZMAT suits.Auspiciously, the accommodations at the alpine resort in this comedy are immaculate - because it's mostly empty.There are a few souls. Among them a writer (Jude Law) interested in the hotel's history, and the owner, Zero (F. Murray Abraham), who's happy to regale him with it over dinner.In 1932, under the tutelage of the overly committed concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), Zero (Tony Revolori) gains employment at the hotel.When a deceased dowager (Tilda Swinton) bequeaths Gustave a valuable painting, it sets off a chain of events that lands him in prison.From the quirky characters, to the pastel aesthetic and the subtle sophistication, this latest offering from director Wes Anderson has his idiosyncratic and affable fingerprints all over it.Furthermore, the Bible is the only item in a hotel room likely to be covered in biological fluid.

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 April 2014,7/10,"After seeing the previews several times, I thought I would enjoy a delightful almost-fantasy-like film. But, at age 64, after going to the movies literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, I did something today that I've only ever done 3 times previously -- I walked out of a movie halfway through the picture. I didn't blame Wes Anderson, because clearly his films have a following...but I thought it must be an acquired taste...that I had not acquired. I admitted that it was a uniquely visually pleasing film, but I wondered why so many fine actors agreed to what were rather small parts. At the time I said that this film bored me even more than ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The the other night it was on cable. I thought I would give it another try, but I fully expected to turn it off at home, also. Perhaps it helped that rather than watch it all in one setting, I broke it into roughly 30 minute segments with breaks in between. Guess what. This time I liked it. I'm not saying I loved it. But I did like it. What did I see this time that I didn't see before. Well, perhaps the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film. The chance to see Ralph Finnes be downright silly instead of his typical dramatic role. The wonderful photography and special effects. The skill of young actor Tony Revolori. The pleasure of seeing F. Murray Abraham again. And, this time enjoying the many ""cameo"" shots.I still think it dragged on a bit too long (at 100 minutes there are still a few small bits that could have been edited more tightly or even eliminated). And, I'm still not a raving fan of it. But, this time around I did ""like"" it. But it won't end up on my DVD shelf, and I doubt I'll watch it again. But, bravo...good (not great) job!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2016,9/10,"I'm reading reviews and I cannot believe what I read. Amount of bashing on this movie is unbelievable. And arguments they use... Either I'm crazy or they are. They say it is not funny enough for a comedy and I say it is not a comedy, so why would it have to be funny. They say that great actors gave lousy performances and I really cannot see that any of the actors failed to shine here. They say characters are two-dimensional, I say it's kind of fairy-tale, they are supposed to be kind of two-dimensional, and in my opinion, they are not anyway.This is a beautiful drama, disguised in some sort of fairy-tale with elements of comedy and action movie, but it is a drama. It tells a story about human nature and friendship and it tells it in an amazing way. The cinematography here is excellent and stunning. It is a feast of colour and shape. And sound and music... hypnotizing and delightful. This movie is a feast for senses and it is more about how it tells the story than the story itself. If they cannot realize that, it's their loss. This is a work of art, not some cheap adrenaline injection.Warm recommendation for those who have the ability to relax and enjoy, without overthinking unimportant details.9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 June 2014,8/10,"You can always tell when you're watching a Wes Anderson's film with all his director motifs. Like Tim Burton, Wes Anderson's films always have a distinctive style. You just have to be a semi fan of his work to get enjoy it. If not, this movie isn't for you. Grand Budapest Hotel is just as amazing to watch like his other whimsical films. One thing, that bother me, is the direction of the narrative. The movie is told through four people, in three different time-lines. The movie couldn't figure out who should tell this movie. It was bit annoying. The first is an unnamed young girl who reads an author's (Tom Wilkinson) book in the present day, about his time at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Then it's told by the young author now played by Jude Law in the 1960s, whom meets the hotel owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Then it's told by Zero who recounts to him, how he got the hotel as a young man (Tony Revolori) in 1932, but the movie isn't really about him. You can really see, how this is frustration. The movie should only focus on the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). All of the other beginning stories wasn't needed. M. Gustave was the best part of the film, and wonderfully play by Ralph Fiennes. By far, my favorite character, he help created. Gustave is very dapper and elegant and courteous and impressively foul mouthed. What a great character. M. Gustave is a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state. Still, I don't know why it is call Grand Budapest Hotel, when it's nowhere near Budapest? The movie also have a fictional World War 2, as Zubrowka's ""Zig-Zag"" fascist and Communism movement fight for control of the country as a backdrop. With its mix of German, Hungarian and Slavic naming elements, Catholicism, fallen nobility and rising fascists Zubrowka is strongly reminiscent of the former lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between the wars. Anyways, when the elder Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in great make up) dies a mysterious death. M. Gustave is framed for her death and sent to prison. Mid-while, the story kinda get way more complex, involving theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune. I like how his films consistently center on the importance of and interaction between families. I found the relationship between M. Gustave and young Zero to be the greatest piece of the film. Still, the movie did had way too many characters. The movie has a lot of Wes Anderson recurring actors as side or minor characters like Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and others. Honestly, some of these characters were not really needed, but seem write in, so he can get some of his friends, a paycheck. Since Anderson film usually features an ensemble cast and a sprawling plot line, not every character get told. The odd telling of what happen to Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) seem lazy. Show it, don't tell it. It kinda lost the emotional impact, by just mentioning it, without showing. I didn't mind the bittersweet ending about M. Gustave, because the movie invested more into that character than Agatha, but it seem wrong, not to show, what happen to them. It seem a lot of the plot conclusion was unfinished. After all, the movie never truly tells how M. Gustave prove his innocent, or who killed him. The film was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. The film has bits from 1939 novel 'Beware of Pity' and 1982 'The Post Office Girl"". You see that in Anderson's films, that he truly love art. Indeed, it's an art-film about loving art. His films are full of charmingly obscure references to old music, theater, literature, paintings and photography. The locations that they use are beautiful. I love the nostalgia look of the clothes, you really get the time period. I also didn't mind the use of handmade miniature models. It was funny to see it, but fits in with the mood of the story, so well. The Deadpan comedy works so well, in this movie. I wouldn't stop, laughing. The silly dialogue is delivered in such a serious way that makes it fun to watch. I'm a sucker for smart comedies. I didn't like the lack of European accents. It was alright. The movie does have some harsh language, but unlike other modern comedies. It's works with the story, because it used to expression deep emotion depth, than a misplace adjective. The violence can be a bit too violent at times. This might be Anderson's darkest, most violent film yet. I really think some people might hate what happen to a certain cat in the film. The movie did a few scenes of nudity that could had been cut. It wasn't need. Overall: The movie takes the cake. In this case, Mendl's Courtesan au Chocolats. It's a good well-made movie with some faults"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2014,6/10,"I am a fan of Wes Anderson.His screenplay and direction is what I adore. But the screw-ball he adds to his frames is why I love his films. The Grand Budapest Hotel has all these factors and that is why I rate it a 6/10. But, when it comes to movies, stories do matter. They are the indirect, significant factor that keeps the audience hooked. Unfortunately, this film drops low in it.The whole film is an extraordinary example of artistic cinema. Each and every frame will enthrall you and you may drop dead with the colors, music and slapstick. The story of a concierge who is framed for a murder of his inamorata finds himself escaping prison with the help of his protégé: well, that doesn't work out much for me. Yes, it narrates through a non-linear screenplay and I am a fan of that, but here in, it only succeeds in cramming the audience's mind with confusion. Even if you pay attention, which you will, won't be enough to comprehend the crux of what the writer (Stefan Zweig?) is trying to say. The ending is clever but I did not feel content with the plot. The use of letterbox aspect-ratios was a bad idea.BOTTOM LINE: You may/may not enjoy the story but you will definitely be entertained by the sheer extravaganza of the art setup. After all, Anderson is famous for that, isn't he? Watchable!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2020,10/10,"So charming, beautiful, unique, and fun to watch! An incredible pastille of well crafted glorious art throughout! I love how there's videos showing how cool Wes's movies are and the camera shots. Very special experience that isn't talked about enough."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 February 2015,8/10,"With the Oscars being on tonight, I decided to watch one of contenders for Best picture and I settled on ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"".Plot In A Paragraph: a unnamed man (Tom Wilkinson) sits down and tells us a story of when he was a young writer (here he is played by Jude Law) and he met the owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel, Mr Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) Over dinner Moustafa recounts the adventures of Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) the newly appointed lobby boy, who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune. Any movie featuring Jude Law automatically gets a thumbs down from this reviewer, as (for reasons I can't explain) I can't stand the man. There is just something about him, that when I see him, it irritates the living hell out of me. (There are movies of his like, ""Closer"" and ""Cold Mountain"" come to mind) When I saw here, he was a younger version of the narrator, I feared the worst. Thankfully his role is small (like the brilliant ""Hugo"") and he is fine. Ralph Fiennes is excellent, and I'm surprised he was not nominated for an Oscar. Tony Revolori makes a big impression as loyal Zero, whilst Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton and Willem Dafoe are all excellent in supporting roles. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray have a small role too. Despite enjoying it, and some great performances, I will probably never watch this again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 March 2014,,"In ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012), auteur Wes Anderson gave us an endearing love story of sorts between two 12-year-olds. He also brought in a stellar support cast, from which two lend their support again here in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"": Edward Norton and Bill Murray. But then, TGBH offers a lot more, quantitatively, in this department. For convenience, the support cast can be sub-divided into two groups. There are mere cameos: Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel. And then there are those that have a small role: F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan. At the center of the universe around which these stars revolve is an absolutely delightful pair: Ralph Fiennes who needs no introduction and marvelous new star Tony Revolori, a Guatemalan-descent Californian.The main story, expectedly, revolves around the titular site. The series of establishing scenes, however, is a wonder to marvel at, comprising 4 temporal layers and 2 present-and-young-self combinations. Layer 1: a young woman walks into a cemetery towards a statue of an author. She then sits downs and reads his book. Layer 2: the author (Wilkinson) talks directly to the audience about how this book came about. Layer 3: the author, as a young man (Law), interviews (loosely speaking) hotel owner Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in an assortment of setting from bath house to restaurant. Layer 4: the hotel owner, now as a young man himself, then named Zero (Revolori), finally gets into the main body of the story – the adventure he shared with mentor Gustave (Fiennes) who was training him as a bell boy at the time.I wouldn't go into the details of the main story which is a crime caper of sorts. While everybody gets a piece of the action, it is Fiennes's show. This is a comic role which, while I wouldn't go so far to describe as casting against type, is certainly infrequent for him. Fiennes is sheer brilliance, opposite which, however, Revolori does not suffer in any way, in the riveting rapport.Set in a fictional European republic Zubrowka in the 1930s, the movie can be thoroughly enjoyed simply as iconic Wes Anderson fun. However, for those that like to take home some food for thought there are dark jabs at the totalitarianism threatening that part of the world."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 June 2014,8/10,"One of the director I always look forward to his movie release is that Wes Anderson. Well, who don't like his movies if they are aware of his masterworks. He's one of the unique filmmakers with extraordinary ideas. I always love his screenplay, especially his miniature cinema sets. He believes in those technics and presents on the screen awesomely than completely done with computer graphics. In this movie as well he used them very nicely and gives pleasure to watch it.As usual this movie too a comedy with director's traditional actors in it. A comedy that set in the backdrop of a hotel theme and their employees. This hotel is called 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' located on the edge of the Alp mountain in a fictional EU country Zubrowska. The story proceeds with the two layers of flashback to the years 1968 and 1932. It unfolds the life story of Gustave, prestigious hotel's caretaker and his pupil Zero, a lobby boy. Theirs struggle over the accusation of a crime and the other side world war is on a verge to invade the nation. Whether they successful to defend against the charges or not is the remaining story speaks.Nice story and performances with eye catching visuals. Easily one of the best of this year. It looks very ordinary if it was a usual style movie, but Wes Anderson's touch made all the differences. The adventures are the highlights in all of his movies and so in this movie. Lots of whites and pinks you can see on the screen which is kind of trademark of this movie. In this humour movie violence partially attached, but safely avoided all the cruelties. With the lend of Saoirse Ronan character the story exploits a little bit youthful romance side. The introduction of other characters in the middle of the storytelling made more venturesome in the later parts.I kind of doubt to suggest it if you are unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's earlier works. You should better start with them before committing this movie. There's a reason, because you may not indulge it like my friend who saw this with me who never hear the director. Otherwise, it is..., of course it is another masterwork by Wes. Anyway, I loved it and waiting for his new project announcement."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 June 2018,10/10,"Nominated for 213 awards and winning 125, this is an absolute gem of a film. It is a rare find that is perfect on every level. There simply can not be any doubt as to why the film won so many awards. The storytelling and humor is uniquely different! I was spellbound and mesmerized from beginning to end. Impeccable dialogue. A masterpiece! This is one of my all-time favorite movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2020,9/10,"This film was pure joy to watch. Wes Anderson has such an eye for detail. Every single shot, character, setting and prop is perfectly designed with a distinct style that permeates the entire film. The story itself is a great portrayal of friendship and loyalty with plenty of excitement, humour and intrigue along the way."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2015,7/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an adventure movie in which we watch a man who tells us the story of Gustave H who was a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka. We also watch a boy who works in this hotel as a lobby boy trying to keep his job in this hotel and eventually becomes the best friend of Gustave H.I liked this movie because it had an interesting and different plot than the other movies that I have watched. I also liked the direction which made by Wes Anderson and it was very good. One more thing that I have to mention is the music which was very beautiful. About the interpretations I have to admit that Ralph Fiennes who played as M. Gustave was as I expected from him outstanding. Some other interpretations that they have to be mentioned are Edward Norton's who played as Henckels, Tony Revolori's who played as Zero and F. Murray Abraham's who played as Mr. Moustafa.Finally I believe that ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a great movie to watch because it has something that we can not find in many movies and that is a new angle of view. From this we can see things different, this movie has color, has ambition and gives us motive to do many things."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 July 2014,9/10,"Those who turn their nose up at the thought of another fussily-filmed, wildly colourful journey into the world and mind of Wes Anderson, will no doubt detest his latest, and arguably most perfect work, The Grand Budapest Hotel. His work is criticised by his haters for being too meticulously structured, his camera limited to sideways and occasionally upwards movements, festooned with bold colours, always leading to that dreaded, overused word - 'quirky'. Yet this is a world a sly wit, of characters so ridiculous and charming that you could wish they would replace the monotonous bores that litter our reality, and one in which Bill Murray is omnipresent.In the pink, mountainous haven of the picturesque, fictitious European country of Zubrowka, sits the Grand Budapest Hotel. In it's heyday, the hotel was meticulously managed by Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), a charismatic, perfume-wearing horndog, who knew all about what his guests wanted before they even knew they wanted it. On the day that one of his elderly conquests, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), leaves the hotel, he meets new lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), and immediately begins to groom him as his possible successor. When he hears of Madame D's death, Gustave and Zero travel to her mansion to hear the reading of her will.She leaves Gustave a piece of priceless art, something heavily resented by Madame's two evil, leather-jacketed sons, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and Jopling (Willem Dafoe), who don't wish to see this lecherous lothario receive a dime. Sensing trouble, Gustave and Zero steal the painting, replace it with some kind of grotesque lesbian erotica, and flee. This sets in motion a series of farcical events involving a prison escape, an apologetic police officer named Henckels (Edward Norton), a missing butler, and the rise of fascism. All of this is told by an ageing Zero (F. Murray Abraham) to a curious writer credited only as 'The Author' (Jude Law).What it all about, you ask? Possibly nothing. This could all be just a splurge of the director's imagination, or a hark back to the grand eccentrics of the olden days. It could be about the state of Europe between the two World Wars, with the Grand Budapest Hotel a multi- national asylum for all of the continent's misfits. But the setting simply seems too fitting for it's comedic approach for it to be labelled with any kind of 'war' or 'period' label, with bursts of slapstick and comedy-of-manners worthy of Lubitsch, punctured by ridiculous exclamations from it's hyperactive concierge. When he hears about an enemy's dastardly plan, he responds ""the f*****s!"".So, I don't quite know what it's all about. What I do know is that I loved every second of watching it's ludicrous story play out, anchored by an outstanding performance by Fiennes. He may seem an odd choice for an Anderson film, whose films are usually littered with the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray (all of whom appear here), but his Gustave is Anderson's greatest creation, brought fearlessly and completely to life by Fiennes. He's certainly no spring chicken, but he's a strange delight to spend 100 minutes with. And that's really how I felt about the entire experience, it was certainly strange, but utterly delightful.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 April 2014,,"Nothing to brag about but a real entertaining and grotesque imbroglio in a deluxe hotel in some eastern European mountains in an in-between time after something and before something else without any precision on the nature of the one or the other. Delirium Hollywoodens with a big touch of English humor on the basis of Stefan Zweig's unsmiling and undisturbed sarcastic irony on the great fall of the very old Holy Germanic Empire, of the less old Austro-Hungarian empire and even of the quiet still recent Prussian Reich à la Bismarck, hence the big grin of the one who knows the Germans and many others in Eastern Europe will have to compensate their frustrations and their disappeared dreams of power with some kind of military adventure, a war, my dear, a war forever and for our happiness when it stops. And the supreme irony is that the heir to all that lost glory, embodied in the Grand Budapest Hotel, decaying and slowly dying, is a certain Moustafa, a survivor and descendant of the Ottoman Empire, a stateless and country-less wanderer across borders, times and places. The extreme incognito persona non grata who controls everything that is slowly going down into the hell of a future that has no predictable nature.The film becomes then the vision of a hollow world seen by hollow men like the same ones by T.S. Eliot. The vision of time going without knowing where and everything, everyone managed and led by no one knows who, and we can even guess that those who have the power to make the world do this or that don't even know they have that power and if they knew they would not know what they would like the world to do.The world is a stuttering surviving corpse who has been abandoned on the road shoulder and forgotten on the way to the cemetery, Stephen King's Pet Sematary of course, since we are all animals doomed to come back over and over again into that trashy world and that swampy life. Apart from that, the war between the super rich heirs who are dispossessed by the dead one and the super servile poor concierge who is the benefactor of this dispossession, becomes the war between two worlds, and after that war the empire of the rich had become the empire of the concierge who had been killed in the meantime and had willed everything to his Lobby Boy who moves from a Zero identification to a Moustafa name with a full beard and total secrecy about his person. And then at the end of that transitory period we have a hint that the world has changed, that the super rich have disappeared and have been dispossessed by the community in some kind of communism without the name and that Moustafa has managed to keep his dying hotel as a compensation of the requisition or is it nationalization of all his possessions? Some say that making the rich poor might make the poor rich.Then the rest is farce and ludicrous clownish buffoonery. Enjoy it, particularly the winter games' challenge in the snow on a sledge with no brake and no driving device. Have a stop at this prankster's antic and you may easily accept that the world we live in is maybe not so bad after all and in spite of all its incoherent nonsensical trickster's absurdity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 May 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson has really become his own unique institution, and by now all lovers of film would have a good idea as to whether they like being a part of that institution or (as was the case with a particular cinema goer in my screening) they want to stay as far away as possible from the obvious works of an artist. I am a very willing participant of Anderson's unique work and after the let-down that was Moonrise Kingdom it brought a smile to my face to see the gifted director back on the right track with a film that is both gloriously funny and incredibly well made.The Grand Budapest Hotel does not sit back to take a breath in it's 100 minute run time, a run time that will include dangerous liaisons, stolen paintings, gun fights, ski chases, love, prison breaks and all manner of things that would be enough to fill in countless films but Anderson is always in complete control of his material and it's clear that this project meant a lot to the man on a personal level. The film's charms feel like an extenuation of Anderson the filmmaker and screen writer, and as films such as the aforementioned Moonrise Kingdom and the misfiring Darjeeling Limited attest to, sometimes this can mean a muddled film which Grand Budapest never is. With such a rollicking and imaginative tale, Anderson has also in the forms of Ralph Fiennes and the virtually unknown Tony Revolori found two actors that are perfectly suited to his colourful characters.While Anderson has always been a fantastic visual director, it's always been abundantly clear his an actors director in equal measure, with many of his cast members over time giving career best turns in his pieces. Despite initial skepticism, Ralph Fiennes is absolute gold as Gustave H., a true joy of a character that will go down as one of the years best and as an actor Fiennes jumps in with both feet to material that required a side to him we have never seen. Fiennes is the glue that holds the film together, but he is ably supported by all cast members, who seem to be having an absolute blast playing with material that feels so alive. The film is made all the more memorable thanks to it's wonderful set design, impeccable score and witty script.No doubt Grand Budapest Hotel will be one of the feel good films of the year, and a very possible suspect at next years Oscars. A truly enjoyable film, that while nothing more than a caper and in no ways emotionally affecting is a blast of fresh air in a film market that fails to dream and imagine the way in which Anderson does.4 fingers in the door out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 October 2020,2/10,"After watching Moonrise Kingdom and not overly enjoying that film. Decided to give this other Wes Anderson film a try, as remembered seeing much high praise about it during its release.After watching the film, found it to be unfunny and not nearly as interesting or engaging as many others claim so. Do not understand the strong following for both of his films. At times was dozing off and became tremendously bored.The acting may be great but found the characters rather irritating and the dialogue just tedious and pretentious. This is a film which awkward to think it is smarter than it is, and for this sake could not get into it.The positives are the visuals and the acting but just did not care about the story and it feels longer than its 100 minute runtime."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 August 2017,10/10,"This was my first contact with Wes Anderson's cinematographic work, and for the very little I now know (this single film), I believe I can agree with the general opinion that the director is good, very competent but also intellectual, making very good movies that are a little difficult to describe in a nutshell. The film entertains us and we're able to enjoy the refined comedy that we're watching, but we can hardly say that its a movie suitable for all audiences. People looking for something less elegant, a more ""popular"" kind of comedy where humor is easier, may have a hard time noticing the jokes and actually laughing.The veteran Ralph Fiennes is the actor with more protagonism. Needless to say, he again gives proof of unquestionable versatility and gives the public a work of excellent quality. Adrien Brody and Edward Norton were also perfectly up to the characters and their challenge. F. Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Jeff Goldblum and other actors of enormous weight and prestige enter this film, but their roles are so small that we cannot even call them roles. Most were cameos. Perhaps the director's prestige and the overall quality of the film were the motives that led so many stars to make these small appearances. After all, as the poet said, ""there are no small roles but small actors"" isn't it?"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 June 2014,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was written and directed by Wes Anderson. It stars the excellent Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, concierge of a famed European luxury hotel. The film is set in the period between the two world wars. Newcomer Tony Revolori plays Zero, a lobby boy whoeventually becomes M. Gustave's sidekick.M. Gustave demands perfection from the staff at the hotel, provides satisfaction to every guest, and knows the correct behavior for any situation. Whether he is at his desk in the hotel, or on a train, or in a prison, M. Gustave maintains his positive, always appropriate behavior. That's a good concept, and it more-or-less holds the film together. More-or-less.Many famous actors appear in small or cameo roles. Amng these are F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, and Owen Wilson. It's always fun to recognize a familiar face, and identify the actor before she or he moves on.When I was in the theater, I laughed a fair amount. However, the movie went in several different directions at once. It was as if Anderson thought, ""OK--that's all the laughs I'll get from this situation, time to move on."" Nothing much is left when you get done with those few funny lines. In fact, if you want to save time, watch the trailer. Most of the film's great lines are in it. I respect the opinion of those who think this was one of the greatest movies ever. At the time of this review, GBH is carrying an astounding IMDb rating of 8.4, putting it in the top 150 movies of all time. However, I just didn't think it was that wonderful. It's a good way to pass a few hours, but I wouldn't dream of going back and seeing it again.This is one of those films that really will work better on a large screen. However, if that's not an option, it will be OK on DVD."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 January 2015,6/10,"The movie tells the story of how Mustafa, a lobi boy, ended up owning the Grand Budapest hotel. The one thing that sticks in your mind, when you watch this movie, is the direction of it. The story is more like a contemporary fairy tell for grown ups, a simple story with some humorous circumstances that makes you laugh with the drama of the characters and their odd choices. However, that can be easily forgotten. The direction though, is the main highlight of the film. It balances between a comedy and drama, with shots that can easily remind of the old silent movies, animating films and 3D blockbusters. The cast is one of the pros of the film also, however the slightly unknown Mustafa takes the interest off the big names. So, as it can be expected by those actors, the performances are great and not over the top, as they could have easily overdone it. So 6 out of 10, because if the script as powerful as the rest of the movie, it would have been a nine."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 July 2014,8/10,"Review: What a brilliant movie from Wes Anderson. The storyline goes down so many different avenues which keeps the movie interesting throughout. The cast was amazing and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as the lead. Like many other Wes Anderson movies, the film is very original, with a punchy script that is funny throughout. The sets were amazing, along with the different costumes and the whole look of the strange and mysterious hotel. It's one of those movies were you will see something new every time that you watch it because of the attention to detail and the many different characters who have there own individual backgrounds. In all, it's a movie not to miss, but you do have to have a certain sense of humour to enjoy it. Brilliant!Round-Up: This role was definitely made for Ralph Fiennes, who played his part extremely well. The chemistry between him and his bellboy was great and I liked the way that he dealt with Tilda Swinton at the beginning. The cast must have been a joy to work with because there are so many big names who bring there own unique styles to this masterpiece. I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson's movies, but this one is close to his best work. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch if you want to see something original and extremely witty.Budget: $31million Worldwide Gross: $167millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about the different goings on in a hotel. 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 July 2014,10/10,"No one has ever confused the films of Wes Anderson with those of the Dardenne Brothers, but in their own inventive way, they can be just as touching. Anderson's latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is very much in the audacious visual style of his previous comic fantasies - absurd situations, oddball characters, and zany action unfolding at a frantic pace. Here, however, the film's unique voice and compelling performances has an underlying humanity that celebrates the social fabric of a civilized society where sensitivity and consideration for others had not yet gone the way of the hula hoop.Inspired by the autobiography, The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig that describes the culture of intellectuals, poets, composers, and playwrights in pre-World War I Vienna, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes place in Eastern Europe in the period between the two world wars, when fascism began its barbaric onslaught against civilized society. Set in the fictional country of Zubrowka, the film opens in the mid 1980s as an elderly author (Tom Wilkinson) talks about his meeting in 1968 (Jude Law playing the younger writer) with Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, a once luxurious but now decaying palace high on a remote mountain accessible only by cable car.As Moustafa relates how he began as a lobby boy and rose to be the hotel's proprietor, the scene shifts to 1932 where Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes in one of his most convincing performances, is the flamboyant concierge who services some of the elderly hotel patrons in more ways than one. His closest relationship appears to be one with the 84-year old Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) whose sudden death touches off a drama that involves Gustave and immigrant lobby boy, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) in one caper after another, the mutually supportive relationship between Gustave and Zero being the centerpiece of the film.As the threat of war hangs like a pall over the horizon, Gustave is left a priceless painting (Boy With Apple) in Madame D. will leading to his pursuit by Madame D.'s treacherous son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), whose hit man is the sinister Nazi-like Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Another of his pursuers is the much gentler captain of the Lutz Military Police, Albert Henckels (Edward Norton), an old friend of Gustave whose heart doesn't seem to be in his job. Madame D.'s lawyer, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) who insists on applying the rule of law, is one of the few sane people in the film.The plot is full of twists and turns, filled with one hilarious situation after another, all unfolding with high energy and backed by the luminous score of Alexandre Desplat. One of the highlights is a chase scene between Gustave and Zero being pursued by Jopling over a Winter Olympics downhill course where red flags provide no obstacle. When Gustave is framed by Dimitri and ends up at Check Point 19, a forbidding looking prison resembling a concentration camp, Zero and his fiancée Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), a pastry chef apprentice who makes super appealing confections created in the kitchen of Mendl's Patisserie, help him escape with the aid of Buster Keaton-type ladders, the criminal Ludwig played by a bald Harvey Keitel, and a secret society of hotel concierges known as the Society of Crossed Keys (Bill Murray and Bob Balaban among others).Eventually, they are confronted by Nazis who are coming to power in the area and have moved into the hotel. Though on the surface, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a Mack Sennett-like comedy, beneath the surface, the film touches on universal themes and has a serious purpose. Old West story teller Charles Russell wrote an inscription in a gift of his stories to an old friend that could serve as a metaphor for the film, ""Friend Tom,"" he wrote, ""this book is of the days that you and I knew. They are history now. When the nester turned the west grass side down, he buried the trails we traveled, but he could not wipe from our memory the life we loved. Man may lose a sweetheart but he don't forget her."" Like the book, we cannot easily forget this film or the nostalgia it invokes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 February 2020,10/10,"War-torn Zubrowka. 1932, '68 and '85. A grandiose inn towers over the frosty mountainous peaks, accessible by rickety cable cars. Its halls, like a fabergé egg, wrapped in decorative garnishments. Jewelled classicism haunts the ornate corridors, tainted glows guiding visitors to their designated suites. International guests, brimming with eccentricity, seeking warmth within the inn's own hearth. Employees upholding the luxurious lavishment that surrounds the building's legacy. These descriptions are, of course, illustrating the proud member of the Society of the Crossed Keys that is The Grand Budapest Hotel.Film, in all its expansivity, offers a multitude of poignancy within each story that is told. Some depict historic events in an attempt to remind audiences of humanity's past mistakes, others strive for emotive reflection within their searing drama. Anderson though, no matter where your opinion lies in terms of his trademark aesthetics, is a distinctive storyteller through and through, as if reciting a bedtime tale. Very rarely, the simplest of stories can be the most effective when manipulated by a distinctive style that exudes an abundance of personality. No convoluted twists. No melodramatic sorrow. No burdensome themes. Just good old fashioned capers. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a reminder that film can combine artistic integrity with general entertainment to form a crowd-pleasing feature without resorting to archetypal traits. It is, without a doubt, tapping on the edge of mastery.Through three differently adorned timelines, Anderson's comedy-drama depicts the story of an unlikely friendship between the hotel's concierge and newly recruited lobby boy, as they embark on several misadventures to prove the innocence of a wrongly accused murder.First and foremost, let's address the obvious. Every single frame in this feature can be extrapolated, printed on a canvas and exhibited in an art museum. Anderson, inhibiting his inner Kubrick, meticulously positions his actors, props and camera in such a mesmerising way that it can only be surmised as art. Whether that be precariously placing Fiennes' arm on a counter or dictating hierarchical power by positioning actors far away from each other. It's purposeful to accentuate Anderson's beloved visual flair. His trademark visual style, involving symmetrical compositions, exterior and interior tracking shots, snap-zooms etc., explicitly grants the hotel itself an abundance of character. The introductory segment expends precious limited minutes in detailing the very foundations of the building, most notably the various rooms that occupy its floors, and does so through epigrammatic cinematography that alludes to embellished imagination.Anderson's story flows beautifully throughout, constantly introducing eccentric characters into the eclectic mix of talent. Gustave's flamboyant yet nonchalant persona juxtaposed Zero's monotonously blunt personality, but it is with this stark contrast that the film proudly expresses its ability to marinate polar opposites. Anderson's screenplay bursting with energy, providing supplement to his perceptible approach, granting every single character memorability and characterisations. The odd expletive or two emphasising the hilarity that ensues within Gustave's misadventures, yet bestowing an equilibrium in visual and literary comedy. I recall my initial viewing being an experience of astonishment, by just how much disposition was embedded within the script for such a small runtime.Every cast member embraced Anderson's aesthetic appeal to maximise their characterisation. Fiennes, in particular, was sublime and withheld the ability to switch between passive aggressive to sarcastically calm beautifully. Revolori battling against Fiennes' domineering demeanour perfectly, each assisting each other in becoming that inch closer to perfection. But even members who had minor roles, including Anderson favourites Swinton, Wilson, Schwartzman and Murray, made a massive impression within the hotel. Costumes were exceptional, exhibiting vintage European cultures without hyperbolising its attire.Desplat's score, ranging from a balalaika to traditional orchestral instruments, elevated the surrounding alpine environment that the hotel was built upon. And, finally, praise must be given to the brief animations that were intertwined. From the skiing chase to the mounting of cable cars, the handcrafted nature of these segments, again, aided in producing personality to Anderson's feature. Especially the introductory tracking shot of the Grand Budapest, which was clearly crafted from layered card and agglutinated together.The Grand Budapest Hotel is brimming with intricacies that enable it to be so much more than just a standard comedy-drama. It's a masterful exercise in combining character-driven dialogue with a contemporary visual style, bestowing a mass appeal upon the colossal front doors of the hotel. Quirky, vivacious and aggressively funny, it secures a director's ambition into the realm of auteurism. It is, in my humble opinion, Anderson's greatest cinematic accomplishment and receives an elusive perfect rating from myself. And remember: ""Rudeness is merely the expression of fear""."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 July 2020,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) :
Brief Review -Taking Wes Anderson's Humour and Comedy One Level Up. Not hysterical but definitely Hilarious. I didn't expect such wild and crazy humour from any film of 2010's decade and here comes a complete shock that brought smile on my face instead of a frown. It's a freaking crazy heck of a ride that doesn't give you a chance to lose interest throughout 99 minutes. What makes it such a good going thing? It's Writing, Acting and Direction. Three strong pillars of this Humongous and Lavish Hotel hold the burden of expectations quite well. It may not make sense sometimes but it ain't got any loopholes or uncertain spams in the writing. After a slow start and losing 12-15 minutes before the main character's arrival, this film tunrns into a hilarious sighting from which you get an adult, spoofy and capricious humour. Ralph Fieness as Mr. Gustavo is as crazy and spontaneous as you can expect. The dialogue delivery by him makes the humour look even more whimsical. Tony Revolory brings cute dumbness through his character and the elder version of him is maturely played by F. Murray Abraham. The supporting cast is brilliant in every scene and every provided situation. The Grand Budapest Hotel has got a pacy storytelling because of which even some mistakes goes unseen. But not to forget the screenplay has so many variations and so many different funny situations placed and sown at right occasions. Wes Anderson has taken his humour and comedy level Up which certainly makes one strong reason to recommend this film. The other 2 reasons are of course Acting and Writing. It makes a rare combo of Crime, Thrill, Drama, Adult Humour, comedy, tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty etc. so add it in your watchlist if you are looking for any of these ingredients.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 July 2014,9/10,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is one of the best films I have seen in recent times. On the surface it is a comedy stuffed full of brilliant one-liners: Ralph Fiennes, as the concierge M. Gustave, gets the chance to play comedy, something he actually does very well. The plot is a picaresque combination of the absurd and the entertaining; I particularly enjoyed the prison-break sequence through the sewers, spearheaded by chief convict Ludwig (Harvey Keitel), and the climactic sequence where Gustave and his sworn enemy Dımitri (Adrien Brody) become involved in a shooting-match in the hotel, where everyone seems to be firing at everyone else with no real sense of purpose. Yet Wes Anderson's film is also an elegy for a vanished way of life; that bourgeois European world of dowagers and countesses, whose indiscretions would be carefully hidden from public view by discreet concierges like Gustave. The settings are quite breathtaking in their grandioseness; the Budapest hotel, with its profusion of exterior windows and restrained pink interiors, the dining-room covered with a blood-red carpet, and the lobby full of pillars, evokes a world of opulence and style. Together with cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Anderson evokes a world of precise geometric shapes - the rectangular pillars set against the rhombuses of the troops; the precise arches of the door-frames and the exquisitely placed dining-tables, turning the hotel dining-room into something resembling an examination hall in a school. The impression communicated is one of a world precisely ordered, both architecturally and socially - which is completely destroyed by military interventions. When the young writer (Jude Law) visits the hotel much later, and encounters the elderly Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the building is on its last legs, a remnant of a vanished world. Hence the film's last sequences assume a poignant tone, especially when we learn what happened to Gustave. Based on material by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), who was forced out of Germany on Adolf Hitler's coming to power, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is an elegy for a world blown apart by military invention. Highly recommended."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 March 2014,8/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is Wes Anderson's most imaginative effort yet. The perpetually quirky master of symmetry expands his scope in a way not seen since ""The Life Aquatic,"" but this story is infinitely more accessible and entertaining.The film, set in a fictionalized version of Europe, takes an unusual storytelling approach. A now- deceased author (Tom Wilkinson) relays the story behind his most famous novel. When he was younger (played by Jude Law), he visited the once-infamous and decrepit Grand Budapest Hotel, where he comes upon the its owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells the story of how he came to own it. He's the film's primary narrator, telling the story of how as a young immigrant boy (Tony Revolori) he came under the tutelage of the hotel's flamboyant and unapologetic concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).Fiennes gives a much-welcome change of pace performance as Gustave that is both hilarious and delightful. The tone of ""Grand Budapest"" leans this way as well. Whereas most of Anderson's films move from that quirky, dry humor into stark depictions of relationships, ""Budapest"" almost never loses its comic edge. Far and away, the film earns its label as Anderson's funniest movie. From the outside, the plot looks like a murder mystery farce. Gustave wins the affections of rich old women who stay at the hotel through flattery and sexual services. When one of his most devoted customers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) turns up murdered, she wills Gustave the priceless painting ""Boy with Apple,"" provoking the ire of Madame's scornful son, Dmitri, (Adrien Brody). To ensure he gets what's rightfully his, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and Gustave makes a deal to make Zero his heir in exchange for his help. The next day, Gustave is arrested for the murder and Zero tries to help him escape and prove his innocence.Gustave and Zero form a hysterical but meaningful relationship. For all of Gustave's risky, eccentric shenanigans, he grows fond and protective of the boy. This kind of friendship has never been the center of an Anderson film; usually, its sibling or family dysfunction. Consequently, ""Budapest"" is a bit shallower in character depth, opting for moments of pure entertainment than inward exploration. On the plus side, it does make ""Budapest"" more accessible than earlier Anderson films, which could now be considered a trend given that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was even more so that way.The case of ""Grand Budapest"" extends well beyond Anderson's circle of actors, relegated most of the usual suspects to cameos and small supporting roles. In doing so, Anderson proves he can direct any actor of reasonable talent into fitting with his style. This ensemble is especially vast, though the one real standout is Willem Dafoe as Jopling, Dmitri's brass-knuckled henchman.Anderson really ups the adventure and fun of ""Grand Budapest"" and celebrates his filmmaking style. He adds even more brightness, color, symmetry and hijinks, something he can get away with at this point in his career due to greater audience familiarity. He hasn't gone his deepest, or really pushed himself as an intellectual, but ""Grand Budapest"" proves to be immensely satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 December 2018,9/10,"Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. Novelist and short story writer. Born at Vienna 1881. Died of suicide at Petropolis, Brazil 1942.This is a work by director/ writer/ producer Wes Anderson. Playful, funny, original and quite unigue! A cartoonesque styled picture about love in times of war. Cant compare it with anything else because Wes Anderson's directing style is so quirky and unique.Anyone familiar with this director will wanna watch everything he makes, because he belongs to the pinnacle of indepedent american film making. He wrote AND produced AND directed this movie. His total creative control over all his movies makes them unique in its kind. Yes it is a comedy, but not as we are used to see it. Yes, it is quirky, but not as we were used to see it before.Wes Anderson's comedies are subtle,full of tongue in cheek jokes and photographed in a CARTOONESQUE visual style that has been copied (miserably) by many others. Wes Anderson's direction style is not just a simple technique though, but a set of mind which differentiates Wes Anderson's pictures from all the other comedies. His jokes are very visual. Many many many directors CAN NOT achieve such a level of visual comedy, it is a unique talent only a few directors are blessed with. Wes Anderson is one of them.Now you still dont know if this movie might be to your liking. Let me explain it this way: IF you love arthouse movies and IF you love to be touched by gorgeous creative photograhpy and original quirky stories then this movie is definitely worth trying. IF none of the before apply to you, this movie might be a waste of your time, because it is too peculiar to be liked by the masses, although it was the most popular independent movie of that year. Please take a chance, if you dont like this particular visual style, you will find out within 15 minutes. The rest will have discovered a delightful gem, suited for young and old."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 November 2014,8/10,"A movie hearkening back to the days between the World Wars, to a time where properness, good manners and dignity still reigned supreme. All in good fun, of course. The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best kind of comedy because it refuses to admit it's one. The events are humorous, of course, as are the character, but those characters always act seriously, as if the bizarre things happening around them are the norm. There's no winking at the audience, except on a story level.The humour is also more intelligent than in most Hollywood comedies. It can play with your expectations and pulls its laughs not from lowbrow jokes but from absurdity, straight man routines and from developed character traits. There's no clowning around, rather adult people are made to look silly when the movie starts pulling apart their everyday routines and revealing the hilarity underneath.It's also a gorgeous movie on all levels. The camera work is superb and the whole movie has a fantastical visual style that both strengthens the jokes along with providing a plethora of its own. The talented cast also deserves a special mention. Ralph Fiennes shines as M. Gustave, a peculiar hotel owner known for his eccentricities and impeccable manners. Such a delightful character and his sheer poise is the source of most of the humour.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see for all Wes Anderson fans and all of those that want to see a comedy with wit, style and finesse."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2015,4/10,"Wes Anderson is back at it again with another one of his quirkfests, this time entirely convincing most critics that he's crafted a masterpiece. Most are mesmerized by the production design, which truly deserves an Academy Award. Anderson opted to use miniatures for wide shots of the hotel and did extensive research for the interiors. The Görlitzer Warenhaus, a defunct German department store which survived World War II, was a stand-in for the Grand Budapest's lobby. Anderson's cinematography, which features all kinds of shots from unusual angles was probably another reason the critics were so impressed with the film (take note of the prison escape scene in particular). But I believe critic Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gets it right when she concludes that Anderson's narrative, is wholly one-note in nature: ""This meticulously appointed doll house of a movie just went on and on, making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration.""The narrative begins when a famous author in 1985 recounts a visit he made to the then decaying Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968; he then met the owner, Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who recounts his days as a lobby boy at the hotel in 1932. The hotel is located in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a remnant of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. One is reminded of the Marx Brother's take on their own fictional Balkan Republic, ""Freedonia,"" but alas in Anderson's ""homage,"" there are no laughs!Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the concierge at the hotel, who takes Zero, the young lobby boy (who is the narrator of the story in his old age), under his wing. Gustave, an admitted bisexual, has been having a very brief affair with the elderly owner of the hotel, ""Madame D,"" who soon dies under mysterious circumstances. She bequeaths a rare painting, ""Boy with Apple,"" which enrages the Madame's son, Dmitri (Adrian Brody), who insists Gustave is not entitled to it. Despite Dmitri's opposition, Gustave steals the painting anyway (aided by Zero), and returns it to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where he places it in the hotel safe. Gustave makes Zero his heir, in return for his help.The Madame's secretary, Serge X, is forced into accusing Gustave of murdering the old lady and Gustave ends up in prison. Gustave remarks that he earned the respect of hardened criminals by ""beating the sh-t out of one of them for challenging his ""virility."" To make a long story short, Gustave digs his way out of prison using tools hidden in cakes baked by Zero's fiancée, Agatha. He and Zero are pursued by an assassin hired by Dmitri, Jopling (William Dafoe) who ends up murdering Serge. Jopling gets his comeuppance at the hands of Zero, who pushes him off a cliff. If this isn't enough, there's also a gunfight with Dmitri and the discovery of a second will inside the painting, proving Gustave's innocence. The reason, most of this hokum isn't funny, is because Anderson's antagonists are unlikeable. Take for example Dmitri—when he first encounters Gustave he calls him a ""fagg-t"" and slaps him in the face. While Anderson attempts to lighten the scene up when other characters start hitting each other in the face, the damage cannot be undone: Dmitri remains an unpleasant villain throughout. In real farce, we experience the outrage without the consequences. But there are consequences aplenty when Serge is murdered up at the rectory. Even Gustave's death during the epilogue, at the hands of those fascist-like soldiers on the train, sounds the wrong note for a film that should be light-hearted (just like ""Duck Soup""). And why all those anachronistic expletives throughout the movie? Why must the elegant Gustave say things that he beat the ""sh-t"" out of that prisoner? Anderson relies on these out-of-character remarks, to obtain a few cheap laughs.Dana Stevens wonders in Slate Magazine, what Anderson is really trying to say here: ""As played with a melancholy rakishness by the handsomer-than-ever Fiennes, M. Gustave is one of Anderson's more memorable creations—but he's stranded in a movie that, for all its gorgeous frills and furbelows (including a lush musical score by Alexandre Desplat and a surfeit of charming cameos from Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray), never seemed to me to be quite sure what it was about. Youth, age, rivalry, and mentorship? Nostalgia for a lost way of life? The ineluctable slaughterhouse of 20th-century European history? These are big, dark themes, ideas that the director (who also wrote the screenplay, with a story assist from his friend Hugo Guinness) seems both obsessed by and game to explore. But somehow Anderson never quite lets himself (or his characters, or by extension, us) get to the deepest, darkest places those paths might lead."" Stevens gets it right when she concludes that with Anderson ""everything remains in that familiar register of chilly, stylish remove.""Ultimately, one can never care for any of Anderson's characters. They are written intentionally not to be taken seriously. Take Agatha and her death from ""the Prussian Grippe."" Not only does Agatha die but so does her infant son. Agatha is supposed to be one of the sympathetic characters, but here Anderson bumps her off too with a cheap aside.Why do so many people find Anderson's vision so enchanting? Perhaps it's the pleasure they feel when his quirky misfits triumph over a coterie of reactionaries (as the evil Dmitri fails to deprive Gustave of his inheritance). Underneath all the slapstick, is standard melodrama (the bad guys getting their comeuppance), mixed with a touch of black humor. In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 July 2014,8/10,"Anderson likes to play both with characters and actors, and the result is a peculiar yet distinctive movie without ""normal"" persons. However, by no means, they are comedies, but rather dramas with comic elements; the same applies to The Grand Budapest Hotel where you can't have big laughs, but there are various opportunities for giggling and snorts. After all, background events and fates of characters are mainly dramatic. But joyful colors, symmetry admiration, the English language in the German surroundings, and lots of poker-faced characters provide the movie a surreal visual. The cast is splendid as well, with lots of winners/nominees of important awards spending less than 5 minutes on screen, and introducing a fresh young face such as Tony Revolori as Young Zero Moustafa. The star of the movie is definitely Ralph Fiennes as Monsieur Gustave H (both elaborated character and performance), but the most peculiar roles were performed by Harvey Keitel as Ludwig, Edward Norton as Inspector Henckels and Tilda Swinton as Madame D (the latter was barely recognizable).A must-see for Anderson's fans, and for all others without petrified approaches on cinema and depiction of ""serious"" events."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 March 2014,7/10,"The work of Wes Anderson is very much a required tasted. Known for his quirky style of direction and writing Anderson has a strong fanbase of film fans, but also has his dissenters. His latest film is The Grand Budapest Hotel easily appeals to his fans, but not going to win over his detractors, telling a story of murder, art-theft and impending war as a hotel concierge in a small European country is accused of murder and sets out to prove his innocents.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a highly energetic, almost screwball like comedy filled with witty lines and a cast that most directors would dream of having. Ralph Fiennes gives an excellent comic performance as the softly spoken lead and he has some of the best lines of the flick. Adrian Brody and Willem Dafoe too were strong as the villains, particularly Dafoe playing a cold-blooded thug of a man. It is refreshing to hear the talented Saoirse Ronan being allowed to use her natural Irish accent for once in a film. Some of the jokes do fall flat and serve as an excuse to give some of Anderson's buddies a cameo such as all the different hotel concierges are all calling each other. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a bright, colourful film and Anderson's stamp is all over it with his trademark shots, angles and camera are all present and he makes a fantastic looking film because of its lavish art-direction and cinematography. Alexandre Desplat supplies the music score for the film and it is a fantastic piece of music, one of his best, using the organ as its base."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is appropriately quirky, farcical drama featuring near-flawless casting and superior direction and cinematography. The year may be young, but Wes Anderson's film is one of my favorites so far. A young writer (Jude Law), staying at the titular hotel, chances to encounter the establishment's elderly owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who relates the tale of how he came to own the place ""between the wars"" in the mythical eastern European country of Zubrowka. Zero began his career as a lobby boy in the hotel, under the mentorship of the hotel's legendary concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave knows his eccentric, rich guests very well, particularly the elderly female ones. One such guest is Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom Gustave has an occasional fling. She is due to leave the hotel and return home, but she's anxious, feeling that someone is conspiring around her. She fears she won't see Gustave again.Well, it's not long before Madame D turns up dead, and Gustave (with Zero) rushes to her wake, only to find himself at the reading of the will. It will surprise few people that the only item of value in Madame D's large estate has been bequeathed to Gustave - a painting called Boy with Apple. But the inheritance is quickly challenged by the deceased's son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), who's a plain mean and profane jerk. And then, as the trailer indicates, Gustave and the loyal Zero abscond with the painting anyway and hide it; Gustave is arrested and jailed. The movie is brimming with spot-on performances. Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, and Bob Balaban have small roles as fellow concierges. Jason Schwartzmann is a present-day lobby boy. Owen Wilson is Gustave's immediate replacement as concierge. Harvey Keitel is a tough inmate. Willem Dafoe is a ruthless hit-man in Dmitri's employ. Most have worked in Wes Anderson films before, and all work very well together.I've seen a few Wes Anderson movies, and I think this one most closely resembles Moonrise Kingdom in terms of its whimsical tone. In fact, it may even bear some relation to the Coen Brothers masterpieces O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Raising Arizona - black comedies whose success depends so much on their actors' ability to really sell deadpan humor in an otherwise-serious context. Fiennes, who's not known for his comedies, is superb as the gentlemanly Gustave, and he drives the movie with equal parts British reservedness and explosive irritation - but always with the utmost in manners. The movie is also beautifully shot, but frequent Anderson collaborator Robert D. Yeoman. From the stylish structure of the hotel to the stark desolation of the Alps, the film has a delightfully distinct look to it, par for the course for Anderson films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 April 2014,6/10,"I saw ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", starring Ralph Fiennes-Skyfall, The Hurt Locker; Tony Revolori-Sons of Tucson_t.v., The Perfect Game; F. Murray Abraham-The Good Wife_t.v., Last Action Hero; Saoirse Ronan- Hanna, The Clinic_t.v. and Edward Norton-The Bourne Legacy, The Incredible Hulk.This is an entertaining, quirky comedy by the mind of Wes Anderson-he directed and co-wrote it. If you are not familiar with his other work, he also directed Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums, just to name a few. Ralph plays the concierge at a popular European hotel, The Grand Budapest Hotel, during the 1930's. Tony is his lobby boy and right-hand man, that is learning the ropes of his job from Ralph. F. Murray plays the adult version of Tony that is telling the story, in flashbacks. When a famous painting is stolen from a guest, a Keystone cop style adventure begins. There are chases, prison incarcerations, prison breaks, more chases and even a big gun battle in the hotel. Saoirse plays a love interest for Tony and Edward plays the local constable that is always in pursuit of answers. I must say, Wes must be friends with a lot of famous actors because there are a lot of cameos in this movie. I remember seeing Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and I think I saw George Clooney. I'm sure I missed some but those are the ones that I remember. It's rated ""R"" for language, sexual content-including nudity-and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I would probably buy it on DVD but it's not for everyone-it depends on if you like quirky."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,8/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is more of the unique craftsmanship of Writer-Director Wes Anderson, which many Wild Wes Wes Lovers will adore. The movie stars Ralph Fiennes in an excellent performance as Hotel Concierge M. Gustave of the titular hotel. Gustave is a suave concierge with his ways of romancing geriatric women heiress who stay in his hotel. One of them would be Madame D, who dies and leaves Gustave a priceless painting in her will and testimony. Madame D's ferocious sons have another plan in mind to relinquish Gustave of the painting. Gustave confides in a young lobby boy named Zero, who saves Gustave out of many near brushes with death & disaster; maybe Anderson should have shown Gustave singing The FIxx 80's tune ""Saved by Zero"" in one of the film's scenes. As in any Wes cinematic offering, there is much quirkiness involved in the film's scenes and characters. But as much as I enjoyed the film's creative ways, I do not think ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" resides in the presidential suite of the greatest independent movie comedies of all-time even though it did have some elements of a first-class stay; which included Fiennes' grand work as Gustave, and other grand thespian works coming from F. Murray Abraham as the older Zero, Jeff Goldblum as Deputy Kovacs, and even the young Zero himself played by newcomer Tony Revolori who is quite a revelation in this picture. Anderson should be credited with another worthy idiosyncratic screenplay and direction of an independent movie. In all, I do think you should check-in and check out ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". And for those of you who did not like this review, just please ""get your hands off my copy boy"", it was not his fault. **** Good"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 August 2014,9/10,"A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of world's greatest hotel concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotel's new lobby boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori). The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 March 2014,6/10,"Wes Anderson lays the lipstick on in buckets in his latest pastel pig featuring a cast of big names (Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Ed Norton etc) who rather than get into character simply attend this costume party long on name dropping and quite slim plot wise. It's like looking at the Macy's Christmas window decorations one city block after the next as Anderson piles on his colorfully precious detail from end to end while dragging the anemic plot behind it.Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) , head concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel and member in good standing with the legion of Crossed Keys is known far and wide for his close attention to detail and the extras (gigolo) he provides to one foot in the grave dowagers who check in. When one turns up dead she leaves him a precious painting and perhaps more but her Boris Badenov looking family will have none of this and H is charged with her murder instead. Along with faithful Lobby Boy, Zero, he sets out to clear his name and unmask the real murderers.All form and no content, Hotel is rich in color and set design seducing you briefly with its cleverness and play land look but with its one cylinder storyline engine it hardly advances at all as Anderson bombards the audience with endless dead pan compositions and sorry slapstick performed by arch characters and special guest stars. The precision, detail and the promise of its look simply fails to support its meager drawn out plot and by the halfway mark you get tired playing with the same toys going in circles.Ralph Fiennes as the perspicacious Gustave brings grace and more than a touch of sophistication to his charming and comic role but the rest of the cast is mass caricature that wears thin after initial contact and The Grand Hotel Budapest goes from four star to Motel 6 in no time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2014,8/10,"At this point I think we're pretty well beyond hope that Wes Anderson will ever try a different style of filmmaking, and for that I wish more power to him. Even the stop-motion children's film The Fantastic Mr. Fox, despite its literary origins, is indisputably Anderson from start to finish. So, in lieu of a proper evolution, perhaps the best one can hope for is for Mr. Anderson to make the perfect Wes Anderson movie. The Grand Budapest Hotel falls quite close to that ideal. Thoroughly quirky, lovingly composed with a strict eye for heavy detail, funny and dense and sweet and genuine; it's everything I love about his pictures, draped over the skeleton of a different tale. The man certainly has his favorites - recurring actors from earlier in his career appear in the dozens throughout this one - but you'll smile and applaud their arrival, one by one, like traveling players in a variety of elaborate costumes and characters. Ralph Fiennes is magnificent as the leading man, a silky-smooth, primped, proper, profane concierge with a knack for elderly women and a ferocious wit. His understudy, lobby boy Anthony Quinonez, is the film's anchor: a particularly straight, self-assured young lead who's cut from the same cloth as Rushmore's Max Fischer. Richly funny, otherworldy in its beauty, quick and sharp as a tack, it goes a bit overboard in the third act but that's all in the name of good fun."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 January 2015,9/10,I had heard great things about the grand Budapest hotel so I decided to watch it and I must say it is a fantastic surprise. The premise sees a hotel concierge being accused of murder and he goes on the run with his bell boy who he becomes good friends with. Now I can't believe more people aren't talking about Ralph Fiennes performance in this film as it is fantastic. He mixes the comedic moments and the drama well and his chemistry with zero really carries the film. The supporting cast is really good with the kid who plays zero really shining and I would expect to see more of him in the future. Jeff goblem is really good in the film and its always good to see him in a film. Edward Norton is great as the army commander and his dialogue is pretty funny.Willem Dafoe and Darien Brody are great as the villains and are funny in their roles. The story is okay and I really enjoyed Fiennes and zeros story but I felt the storytelling part of the film was quite unnecessary and I may have given this film a perfect score if it had just been a self contained story. The script is fantastic with the dialogue being fantastic and allowing really being memorable and making all the characters interesting. At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the style but it does look breathtaking and the hotel looks beautiful which is a big part of the film. Overall this is a fantastic film that will come as a big surprise i would expect.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 July 2014,8/10,"""Did he just throw my cat out of the window?""If you were to walk blind folded into a movie, you'd only need 5 seconds to recognize you are watching a Wes Anderson film. His quirky sense of humor and stylized films are so unique that he manages to draw us in to this colorful world effortlessly. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception, and once again Anderson introduces us to a quirky setting full of dysfunctional yet amusing characters. In my opinion there was no better setting for an Anderson film than a fictional country in Eastern Europe like the one in The Grand Budapest Hotel where these gigantic and beautiful ancient castles fit his style perfectly. At times his films feel like you are turning the page of an illustrated book from one scene to the next and that is what is so unique about his style. I am a huge fan of his films and wasn't disappointed with his latest effort although I wouldn't consider it amongst his best work (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Moonrise Kingdom are my favorites). I do acknowledge however that his films tend to grow on me upon rewatches so it may manage to make it near the top of my list in the future. Once again watching an Anderson film proved to be a wonderful and unique experience, and I laughed hard during many scenes. Anderson never seems to lose his touch as there are several memorable moments throughout the film.No one can deny Wes Anderson's creativity and it is just a pleasure to experience what his quirky mind is going to come up with next. The dialogue is brilliant once again and several characters stand out. Ralph Fiennes in the lead role as the hotel concierge is brilliant as is his apprentice, Tony Revolori. The two have great chemistry together as Fiennes' character sort of becomes the parent figure of the young lobby boy, which Anderson always loves to explore in his films. The epic cast was brilliant as well, and it was good to see Anderson's frequent collaborators on screen together once again. They may not have much screen time, but Anderson fans will appreciate every second they are on screen (Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton). The highlight of the film for me were the spectacular and hilarious chase scenes through the gorgeous Alps background and Willem Dafoe's comedic performance. The way Anderson edited those scenes was extremely funny as well. I really liked the quirky soundtrack which just added to my overall enjoyment of the film. I only wish the film would've explored the romantic relationship between Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan a bit more and that it wouldn't have concluded in such an open ended way. It was still a lot of fun!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2021,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a comedy crime drama movie directed by Wes Anderson and stars an ensemble cast of Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Edward Nortan, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Mathieu Amalric, Harvey Keitel, Owen Wilson, F. Murray Abraham and Tom Wilkinson.Set in the fictitious country of Eastern Europe. The movie is based on the story of Gustave H, the concierge of The Grand Budapest hotel who is wrongly framed for the murder of one of the loyal guest and a lover of Gustave H.After watching the movie I have to admit that my soul is thoroughly satisfied, the movie is been beautifully crafted by Wes Anderson and despite being a heavily decorated star cast the director is been successful in taking the best of them all although the main highlight is the immaculately perfect acting of Ralph Finnes and Tony Revolori and their impeccable camaraderie.The movie is undoubtedly stylish, visually gorgeous and mentally satisfying. The movie is beautifully blended with Humour, romance and meticulously made scenes. On the one hand the the movie is hilarious and on the other hand the movie is tense.Acting is the strongest pillar of the movie and all the stars have done their work superbly and made a mark, whenever you watch any movie which is so heavily star studded sometimes it gets difficult for a director to bring out the best from the actors but this is not the case with this movie as all the actors has left their mark and were superb.Screenplay of the movie is funny and hilarious, there are many scenes which despite of being normal scenes will instantly bring smile and laughter on your face. Climax of the movie is brisk but defies satisfaction.This is one of the most visually stylist and mentally satisfying movie I have seen with beautiful cinematography and eye catching locations. A must watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2020,5/10,I normally like Wes Anderson films but I think I missed something in this one. It had some laughs.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 May 2018,10/10,"I write a yearly book for listing 2000 of the best films of all time at Amazon. This film not only makes my top 2000, it makes my top 100, which is very difficult to do. And I do not usually give out tens for ratings as well. A ten represents a perfect film, which this is. Films like Cinema Paradiso, Lawrence of Arabia, Lost Horizon, and The Producers get 10s. This is a comedy as good as The Producers.
The actors in this film really stay in character, and no one hams it up. Brody came close, but his role called for someone over the top. Everyone else was extremely professional and low-key. It's the best thing that Goldblum has ever done. And several of the cameos are absolutely first-rate. This is a film not to be missed by any serious filmgoer. Fiennes deserved an Oscar for this role.Dr. Arthur H Tafero

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 January 2015,6/10,"Beginning in the 1930's, Zero Mustafa is a young lobby boy working at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Mustafa ends up under the wing of, and ultimately befriended by, hotel concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). The story chronicles the life of Zero Mustafa and tells us how he ended up becoming the owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Along this journey, Mustafa finds love and also finds his friendship and loyalty to Gustave is tested to the hilt when Gustave is accused of stealing a valuable painting and is also accused of murder. How will this endeavour end?I found this to be a charming film and I also found it to be a very funny film as well. The narrative is brilliant and is told in such a way that it makes you feel as though a book is actually being read to you (which I suppose is the point). It's a good story and as mentioned the whole 'crime caper' scenario does keep things fresh and fun. This strong narrative is helped by the great chemistry and inter-play between Fiennes and newcomer Revolori. They're a great double act and they both played off well against each other whenever they were on screen together.Where the film suffers slightly are in the majority of the scenes that don't involve Gustave and Mustafa. I think because they were so good together and because their characters were much better developed than the other characters, there were some sections of the film that didn't involve Gustave and Mustafa where it did get a bit boring. It doesn't help that the antagonists are particularly poorly developed and the writers don't seem to give us any reason to care for them. This meant that I didn't find this film interesting when it was shown from the antagonists perspective. Thank goodness then that Fiennes and Revolori were so good as they really were the driving force behind this film. Performances across the board were solid and notable praise should go to Fiennes, Brody & Norton. The cinematography was both crisp and bleak which was fitting given the fact that the story takes place between the first and second world war.I did enjoy Grand Budapest Hotel and found it to be a nice story that was charming, funny, and quite moving towards the end. The only real drawback with it is that it's rather thin in terms of character development and the film does sag a bit in the middle. As I said in my summary though there are more hits than misses and Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely worth checking out."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 December 2019,8/10,I will not rest until the academy pays for their heinous crime of not even nominating ralph fiennes for best performance by an actor in a leading role. just wondering when they'll learn to have fun & recognize comedic talent!!!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 February 2016,8/10,"I know I'll tick some readers off by opening up this piece by saying that usually I'm not a fan of Wes Anderson's films. But it's the truth. His pristine postcard precision is all well and good, but often seems to be completely absent of any kind of emotional heft with which to round out his visually impressive efforts. His output just has a forced, deliberately quirky vibe that generally makes me want to tear my hair out. Happily, I can say that's changing for me, starting with the excellent Moonrise Kingdom, and continuing on to his absolutely brilliant masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel. Finally the man is injecting some human warmth into his pastel pantomimes, giving us something to cling to besides the droll banter he has become famous for. It's like he's reached a maturity in his work that leaves behind the solely idiosyncratic, frustratingly hipster qualities which put him on the map, adding elements that will appeal to more people and in turn make his work much more accessible. Budapest is a rollicking wonder of European wartime wonder as seen through the eyes of the various staff and guests of the titular mountaintop establishment. The dashing concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes in a performance of legendary, dashing suave) takes a young lobby boy Tony Revolori) under his wing, making him privy to a series of madcap adventures involving all kinds of oddball nut jobs from the hotel and the surrounding area. When his elderly lover (Tilda Swinton buried in dusty makeup) croaks, her villainous son (a mustache twirling Adrien Brody) seeks to purloin Gustave's portion of the will with the help of his nasty, stoic henchman Jopling (a priceless Willem Dafoe). The pace quickens as the plot thickens from that point, as Zero meets the love of his life in local chocolatier's assistant Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and the two of them attempt to evade the law and Brody's reach in the funniest, most touching comedy of errors in years. Anderson attracts some of the best actors around, and here he gathers together the best cast he's ever assembled, including Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Almaric, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and more. F. Murray Abraham has a touching appearance as the older version of Zero, physically wealthy yet left on his own by time and tragedy. Anderson spins a carnival show of colourful happenings, with a cast that's ready to bite. Die hard fans of is style saw this as another great entry in his filmography. I see it as the first in a line of flicks I've been able to really enjoy and relate to, and I hope he brings us more."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 April 2020,5/10,"The style of this movie was very interesting, the colour pallete and cinematography were amazing. The story was very weird, it felt too unrealistic, but not enough to count as a fairytail, quite bland to be honest, can't really retell what happened in it with detail."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 December 2019,7/10,"This movie is unique. Funny, different, stylish piece of work that kept me smiling throughout, but there were some parts of the movie that seemed forced in."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 April 2014,9/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the latest quirky masterpiece of young acclaimed writer-director Wes Anderson. Since his breakthrough writing and directing ""Rushmore"" in 1998, his every output had been highly anticipated, admired and discussed. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), ""the Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (2010) and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2013) have all been nominated for Oscar honors. His films are all marked with wry humor and out-of-the-box imagery, making them delightful and memorable.His latest film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" brings us to quaint and exotic Eastern Europe in the 1930s. The hotel was in its heyday as the hangout of the rich and famous, under the efficient management of its charming concierge, M. Gustave H. When one of his favorite guests, Madame D. was suddenly murdered, Gustave becomes implicated when the Madame bequeaths a precious painting to him, to the dismay of her family. What follows is a merry and witty romp as Gustave sought to prove his innocence with the help of his loyal protégé, the young lobby boy named Zero.This fanciful story was told as a story written by an old author in the 1980s talking about his youth when spent one night interviewing the elderly Zero Moustafa, the owner of the hotel, way past its prime in the late 1960s. I thought this layered story-telling style of a tale within a tale within a tale is totally delightful and inspired.Old European charm and gentility is stamped all over this film. The production design should be commended for those beautiful sets. The hotel and the mansion of Madame Z. especially were both so deliciously grand and ornate. The period costumes were amazing in their detail and sense of humor. The actions sequences were done like silent movies from the 1920s -- totally fun.The main actor is Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave. This multi-faceted actor can really do no wrong. Now, you can even add comedy to his list of talents. His comedic timing was flawless. The rest of the cast was a merry mix of Oscar-caliber actors, winners and nominees alike. The elder Zero was played by F. Murray Abraham, who had not been seen in a mainstream movie since he won the Oscar Best Actor in ""Amadeus"" (1984). We also see Adrian Brody, Tilda Swinton, Soarsie Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Owen Wilson. This all-star cast were all on point in their portrayals in their small but marked roles.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. It is delightful. It is charming. It is the most fun I have had watching a Wes Anderson film since ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 August 2019,10/10,"Wes Anderson is an unequaled cinematic treasure; or at least, that's how I view him and his work. Anderson is a filmmaker whom plenty of cinephiles adore, but a few find him to be too pretentious. To those who think this film is pretentious, I say 'bah humbug!' It's not pretentious; it's refined. This is a film for people who love stories, more specifically, people who love books and the relationships we can form with their characters even if we don't meet them and about longing for a time that we've never known.Though I enjoy all of Anderson's films, if I'm being honest, I think this is Anderson's best. As far as story goes, it's certainly his tightest and most intriguing script, and it has some of the most delightful and well-developed characters, and the charming world that he crafts in this film is one that I love so much I would be willing to live there (quite seriously). I love this film; I love the characters; and I love the humor. It's simply a marvelous delight to watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 May 2014,9/10,"Let it be noted I have only seen Darjeeling Limited and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou when it comes to Wes Anderson's movies and each one contains this weird sort of oddness which you so badly want to associate with someone, but can't fully. Like, for me, I want to say some of the comedy feels Marx Brothers inspired, sans Harpo, but then that isn't really right. And at the same time I want to say the quirkiness feels like a something Woody Allen would produce, but the characters are too interesting to be part of a Woody Allen movie, so this film can truly only be described as a Wes Anderson original which is very hard to exactly compare.Characters & StoryAt the heart of the story, we learn about the life of Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) during his younger years when he was simply known as Zero (Tony Revolori), a lobby boy for The Grand Budapest Hotel during the time when M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was concierge. His tale is laced with romance, filled with drama, and a bit of heartbreak too.The romance deals with his love for Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and Gustave's love for old women; the drama deals with when one of Gustave's admirers Madame D (Tilda Swinton). dies and bestows something to him which angers her children, but none more than Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who with the help of his man for hire Jopling (Willem Dafoe), seems to do everything possible so that not only would Dmitri and his sisters would gain the entire fortune, but erase anyone who could stop them. As for the heartbreak, I'll leave that for you to witness.PraiseI don't think it would be too far fetch to say that Wes Anderson, thus far, hasn't made a lot of movies which could be considered mainstream. However, I think this film could have a bit of universal appeal, and not just because the actors Anderson uses have increasingly been more and more famous since he has last worked with them. Part of the reason I think this has mainstream appeal is because it is very comical. Gustave is a highly likable character who Fiennes plays so wonderfully that I'd hope he at least get a Golden Globe nomination next year. Alongside that, the story, after you get past it being a story, within a story, within a story, is quite entertaining. Be it Gustave's hijinks as he steals a painting and escapes prison; Gustave and Zero's relationship which is noted to be a brotherhood, but more so comes off like a father and son type relationship; or the dozens of characters which each have distinct personalities which make it so none of them fully leave your memory when all is said and done. To me, though the tried and true fans may say his other works maybe better, this one is the best to me, so far.CriticismWhen it comes to criticism though, thinking about the movie as a whole, I can't really say there is any glaring issue. If anything, my issue was the fact I had to travel far to see this, but that is more a personal issue than anything dealing with the film. Overall: Worth SeeingThough not overtly funny, it is because it isn't trying to make up for a weak story by having over the top comedy. This film has moments which will at the very least make most smile, and for some make them laugh out loud. Combine that with a touching relationship between lobby boy and concierge, and the movie feeling strangely short, you will be left with fond memories and may even want to see this again for the dialog was very quotable and well written. Hence why I say this is worth seeing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2014,8/10,"This is a slick slapstick comedy adventure film taken at a fast pace without a trace of heaviness but with a continual cleverness that had me glued to my chair for the 99 minutes in case I missed anything. More happens in any one minute in here that happens in some entire films (if you don't believe me just try Once Upon A Time In Anatolia for comparison), this is a motion picture first and foremost designed to entertain and make money.Faded hotel owner tells the story of his success in life to an interested guest, how he started off as a eccentric lobby boy to an eccentric employer superbly played by Ralph Fiennes. An elderly rich female  patron dies or is murdered leading to Fiennes stealing a valuable painting, going to jail, and having her thwarted and thrusting family on his and everyone else's heels. And much more. It's a sumptuous and atmospheric world portrayed in a lucid cartoony style – one of my favourite bits being what the impetuous Willem Dafoe did in lawyer Jeff Goldblum's office and Goldblum's perfectly delayed reaction to it. Other fantastic (in every sense of the word) bits: the deep-end introduction of Zero the lobby boy; the cartoon escape from the prison; the 200 mph ski/sled chase through the snow and abrupt end; the call for help to the Society Of The Crossed Keys; the mass pointless shoot-out at the hotel. So many good witty and stylish scenes! Unfortunately a few tasteless ones too, the occasional gratuitous swearing, coarseness and violence is at least understandable – no matter whether the film is in 1932 or 1968 you know damn well you're really still in 2014 and if at all, not so easily shocked. However, replacing the ""valuable painting"" for a piece of pointless graphic pornography is neither easy to get down or get off on – you know damn well the makers (and maybe a larger section of the audience) wouldn't have countenanced a portrait of two gay men masturbating instead - after all, can't be too shocking.Fiennes is memorable as the bizarre lead character Gustave, and in his bizarre relationship to the round-eyed Zero during their journey through this marvellously cynical live-action cartoon for the 21st century. Definitely not another Trouble In Paradise or Grand Hotel and nowhere near being a perfect film but overall, totally engrossing and hugely enjoyable hokum worthy of repeat viewingsbut with room for reservations."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2014,,"Rarely has a movie looked so good: the compositions and colours make each shot a minor work of art. Rarely has a film had such a constellation of stars: in a fun exercise of 'spot the actor', you should be able to identify a dozen, although one will prove harder than the rest (clue: it's an elderly woman). But then this is a work from the idiosyncratic Wes Anderson who wrote, produced and directed.The structure is a story within a story within a story and at the heart of this Russian doll is a tale set in a mythical Middle European nation called Zubrowka between the two world wars and focused on Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), the dedicated but eccentric concierge of the eponymous hotel, and his aspiring young bell boy Zero Mustapha (Tony Revolori). In a wonderful cast full of exquisite performances, Fiennes is a revelation. The man who chilled us in ""Schindler's List"" here shows a remarkable skill in comedic acting.In a twisting plot of deceit and murder, above all this is a whimsical work from the opening views of the hotel to the final credits (when a little Russian character does a dance). Shot entirely in Germany, most of the scenes were filmed on the stages of the Babelsberg Studios."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 February 2015,8/10,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a zany, colorful and fascinating journey through old postcard Europe, such as only Hollywood can think of. With his old, almost square picture format Wes Anderson pays tribute to recent days, but with the whole movie. In addition to his brilliant humor and endearing characters, this film captures gems with seemingly small details and meticulous compositions. For me, now one of the funniest and most original movies of 2014.The style is unique. You will either like it or you won't. There is no middle ground here.With too many great actors to mention, they all gave outstanding performance that will keep you enchanted."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2014,8/10,"My expectations were high after hearing the heaps of praise lavished on Wes Anderson's latest absurd comedy, The Grand Hotel Budapest. Critics adored this small gem of a film. While I was neither overwhelmed or underwhelmed by this well-made film, I greatly admired it, especially in its grandiose style and artistry on every technical level, but I never truly connected with all of the characters or their situations emotionally. Let's just say I was whelmed.Like his other films (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom), there remains the director's idiosyncratic calling cards: Characters never walk or stroll, they gallop or scurry haphazardly about. Plots are hatched and become more convoluted than needed. Violence erupts unexpectedly. Title cards organize the action. Vibrant colors and quick hints of irony are in full view. Yes, there is always that certain whimsy and boldness to Anderson's cast of characters (and his recurring repertoire of actors) and his meticulous attention to detail in its setting. However, this time, his film carries with it a more serious undertone which tends to repeatedly undercut the farcical elements of the tale. There is much wild abandon and dollops of insightful and witty dialog, but this time around, The Grand Hotel Budapest never pushes itself beyond all-out farce mode. The overall effect seems a tad labored.The film is told in flashbacks, a story within a story within a story, like an elaborate Russian Matryoshka nesting doll. The film begins with a student is reading a book in a cemetery that leads to its author (Tom Wilkinson) reminiscing about the glory and heydays of the impeccable Grand Hotel Budapest, which leads to a young writer (Jude Law) meeting a former Lobby Boy named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham in the later sequence and Tony Revolori in the earlier ones) who reminiscing about its clientèle and his mentor, the hotel's chief concierge known as Gustave H. (a winning Ralph FIennes), a fastidious and proper dandy who beds the elderly ladies who stay there. Tilda Swinton (unrecognizable in superb hair and make-up) plays one of his conquests, Madame D., who bequeaths an expensive painting to her lover, causing a chain of events that becomes the main storyline in this tale of murder and mayhem. It's all cleverly constructed, perhaps too lovingly layered by Anderson, but it is precisely the film's structure that becomes a plot device which slows the film's comic momentum whenever it leaves the silly hi-jinks of M. Gustave H. and Company.But, dear moviegoers, The Grand Hotel Budapest has so many virtues to warrant your viewing. Starting with Anderson's solid direction and wonderful vision, the film boasts excellence on every technical and artistic level: great acting and cameos by many fine actors, memorable costumes by Milena Canonero surrounded by opulent production design by Adam Stockhausen, and Alexandre Desplat's lyrical East European inspired score. Kudos also go to the stunning photography by Robert D. Yeoman and expert editing by Barney Pilling. This film is sure to garner many awards this upcoming movie season.The Grand Hotel Budapest is a well-intentioned and well-crafted film by a talented director and his creative team. It is a diverting trifle, deliciously entertaining, delightfully nutty, and yet bittersweet, like a confectionist treat from Mendl's. Too bad it's not all that filling.

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2019,7/10,My Rating : 7/10Beautiful visually - the film looks like a pretty cake! Every scene is framed like an exquisite work of art.While I'm not fond of the story or it's characters - the color and cinematography is gorgeous to keep looking at!And just like a good looking cake its full of sugar and empty calories - a marvelously pretentious movie with no apologies!

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 July 2014,7/10,"The story premise is both a common but also a unique one, that is of a personal biography. The unique adventure is presented nicely with the use of exotic locations, lavish sets and makeup, and also non-common camera angles. The acting is indeed quite a gem. Ralph Fiennes did a great job in doing his character, a focus character a distinction from his other roles. And he does this very well, considering that the character experiences wide variety of scenes including training a lobby boy and surviving a gun shootout. Having big names such as Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Harvey Keitel on the supporting characters is just a great thing to make this merry movie the merrier."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 February 2021,9/10,Wow. Every single shot and frame of this film blew me away. Easily one of the best-looking films ever made. Don't miss this one.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 September 2014,7/10,"The latest offering from director Wes Anderson, who is known for his own style of presenting a magical make-believe world on the screen, this is a fine example of an imaginative art of storytelling taking you into a different world of the past quite impressively. Narrating the story of a vintage hotel, the film has glimpses of more than one genres including illegitimate affairs, crime, love, murder, theft, jail-break, mystery, chases and much more. But in spite of that it never puzzles you due to an absorbing treatment of an interesting concept and some brilliant performances by a rare cast ensemble with many reputed names.Set in different time zones of the twentieth century, it is mostly narrated in flashback and tells us about the life a young 'Lobby boy' and his experiences with his boss,Mosieur Gustave. The lobby boy known as Zero is now the owner of The Grand Budapest and the film is all about his journey from joining the hotel to the present status of a sad, lonely man owning the mansion and much more. In the story told of the past, as one of richest regular visitors of the hotel suddenly dies, she leaves a precious antique painting for Gustave to be her parting gift in the will and that's from where the whole saga of crime and deceit begins involving the young Zero.The film unfolds like an exciting fast paced tale in a bedtime storybook of the young ones and presents many charming cameos of prominent names such as Jude Law, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and more. Along with the lead roles played by Ralph Fiennes & F Murray Abraham with a splendid portrayal of the young zero by Willem Dafoe.A kind of wacky comedy, it also subtly showcases the war scenario of those times & three different eras of century through some smartly written witty dialogues, an excellent background score, well detailed art direction and a worth experiencing cinematography (particularly the snow chase sequence at the mountains) which preferably needs to be seen at the big screen. The storyline also has a refreshing emotional angle between its leading male characters and then has a few surprising insertions too like a turbaned Sikh participating in a sequence happening in the Eastern Europe region of the 1930s.But at the same time, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL doesn't offer any great energetic crescendo and is also not for the ones watching Hollywood Cinema mainly for their mainstream well promoted films releasing worldwide. This is for the niche audiences who are more into the offbeat movies and can easily relate to this eccentric kind of story-telling not interested in giving any kind of simulated high through an overdose of computer graphics or some loud treatment. So if you love watching this specific genre then you are sure going to enjoy The GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL largely."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 September 2014,6/10,"Oh noes. I was looking forward to this.It creates a charming world, the production is great, big name actors.But I got just one laugh, and that was in the trailer - when the concierge said to the police, ""I knew there was something fishy"", and ran away.It's basically a Mel Brooks comedy - clever, self-conscious, increasingly absurd, but deep down ideological. Plus the music is always arch, turning every scene into a cartoon.Ralph Fiennes was brilliant at first, but the cunning of his concierge became less important as the story went on, when I was expecting more. And although it became a bit gay and join-hands-together, there was no interesting female role.The Nazi slant in the end may have been necessary, but weren't the nasty relatives sufficient?ps. I had no idea Tilda Swinton was in the cast."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 September 2014,9/10,"I haven't seen many of Wes Anderson's films. I think I've seen DARJEELING LIMITED and most of LIFE AQUATIC. I don't remember much, as it's been a while since either, but the one element that remained with me was the incredibly unique style of the filmmaker. I've heard and read plenty about Wes Anderson's talents, seen the praise heaped on his work, but it wasn't until the release of THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL that I made a point to seek it out. The trailer was hilarious and the visuals were gorgeous, and a lot of people were claiming it to be one of Anderson's more accessible films so I figured I'd use it to see if he might be a director I want to check into further. Thanks to THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, the answer is a resound yes. I loved this movie. It's framed as a story within a story within a story. We open with an introduction from an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) who penned the tale that's about to unfold based on the experiences of Zero Moustafa, the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel with whom he'd become acquainted during a visit in the late '60s. It tells of an adventure he'd become entangled in when first hired as a lobby boy at the hotel in the '30s under the tutelage of the hotel's most famous concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave had a reputation for forming intimate relationships with the elderly ladies who came to the hotel and, when one such beloved rich guest dies under mysterious circumstances, Gustave is willed a rather valuable painting in her passing. This draws the ire of the woman's selfish son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody), and sends Gustave on the run with his trusted lobby boy Zero when Dmitri accuses him of his mother's murder. Hilarious antics ensue.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL had me grinning from the moment we're introduced to Gustave until the very end. I don't know if all of Anderson's other films are this much fun but, if they are, I'm sold. The humor is often subtle and it's so fast-paced that it's easy to miss a great line or delivery if you're still laughing from the last. I've seen it twice now and it was just as enjoyable on both viewings. Fiennes is fantastic as M. Gustave. Gustave is the epitome of class. He swore an oath as the concierge of the Grand Budapest and he lives it to it's fullest. He has an immense respect for the position and finds enormous delight in his daily routine, especially when he's getting cozy with some wealthy elderly woman. One would assume he does it for the very reason he finds himself in this mess: get the woman to love him and reap the benefits in the form of gifts. I never felt it was quite clear if does it out of greed or if he actually had a thing for these women. There were glimmers of both in him. One thing's certain, he's a man of loyalty. Aside from the unwavering faith to the Grand Budapest, he forms an almost immediate connection with Zero (Tony Revolori), his new lobby boy. Zero accompanies him to the viewing for the deceased Madame and finds himself caught up in the craziness immediately after. Gustave becomes a mentor to the boy, going so far as to give his blessing when Zero falls in love with a local baker's daughter, and promises Zero the fortune from the painting should anything happen to him.Enough about Fiennes fantastic performance; there's loads more I loved about this movie. The cast is loaded to the breaking point with talent and everyone delivers. The advertising prints for the film are half cast list, promoting the more than a dozen talents starring in the film. Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton the list goes on with special mention to Willem Dafoe as Dmitri's hard-boiled, silent henchman. It's also nice to see Jeff Goldblum on screen again, even if it's just a minor role as the hotel's lawyer. The impressive cast is fine match for the film's even more engaging visual style. I don't remember much of Anderson's other films but I hope THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a nice indication of what I can expect to see. The film's colors pop vibrantly. The whole world of the Grand Budapest (in the 30s) is a pastel wonderland of pinks, purples, and reds. And I loved that the camera never stopped moving. Every frame has a frantic vibe, if not for the character's erratic natures then the constant camera movement. I really can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. The story was fun, the characters were quirky, the film looked beautiful, and it's got an amazing cast. I'm not sure how general audiences would respond to a film so strange but it's won me over as a potential fan of Wes Anderson."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 July 2014,3/10,"Concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is accused of murder of one of the Hotel's more wealthy clients, goes on the run, is captured and goes to prison. Then he escapes. What they showed in the promos were some of the most clever skits and I thought I would enjoy this. Didn't happen. The story was simple enough but the director made it more complicated than it should have been. I believe the idea here was to incorporate fantastic visuals regarding the photography, and cinematography. And, they were fantastic. Visions of SIN CITY and DICK TRACY visuals filled my head at those times. This story was dragged out to the glee of some and no-glee to others including me. Yes, I took a few naps along the way and missed nothing. The dialogues were all monotone which helped the road to slumber land at times. ( Monotone? Really?) Yes. Although billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here. A few clever lines, and bewildered looks do not a funny movie make. I won't mention that sometimes the characters spoke so fast I had no idea what was said and just went with it hoping that something later on would translate those dialogues into something that I could understand. But, I won't mention that. HA!The only funny thing I, sort of, laughed at was when Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) notices that Jopling (Willem Dafoe) throws his cat out the window. More slap-stick in here would have gone a long way to being a funny movie. If no comedic lines would be forthcoming, bring on more slap-stick. Didn't happen. I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes as the Concierge and if he had only been given better comedic lines and rose above the monotone acoustic level, he would have been as fantastic as the photography and cinematography were. Yes, yes, I do understand that his position really wouldn't allow for that but.. Didn't happen. In a word, this turned out to be quite boring. By stifling Fiennes' character Gustave this became, well still quite boring. I did recognize Bill Murray as Ivan, Jude Law as the young writer, Jeff Goldblum as Kovacs, and Willem Dafoe as Jopling and they were okay. There were other stars in here with small parts, but they were in camouflage mode and I didn't readily recognize them. See if you can. In the beginning there were hints of sexual hi-jinks with someone being serviced orally and later we see a graphic painting of nude lesbians touching each other. I thought there would be more of this along the way, but the director was still too concerned with the photography and cinematography and as mentioned these were fantastic and we saw no more sexual hi-jinks. This was way too long and lost me often, but keep in mind the focus was to present the photography and cinematography and that was successful. The dialogues were entirely predictable run-of-the-mill utterances. Not good. All in all this was very disappointing and not the class act some think it is. Boo Hoo. (3/10)Violence: Yes, some not much. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, a water hose washing down a backside. Language: Yes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 April 2014,9/10,"I feel like Wes Anderson's career has been leading up to this film. It's safe to say that those familiar with the literate, quirky director and his celebrated style will find much to enjoy regarding the goings-on in an Eastern European luxury hotel. Those who come in from the cold will likewise find a rare wistful quality and a very common air of post-modernism stabbed through unfamiliar settings.Those who know me know I have not been a fan of Anderson's work in the past. Wasting the potential of large, well known casts and keeping everything fussily symmetrical and pastel, I once compared him and his style unfavorably to that of a 1970's pornographer. I always sensed there was a distance between the elaborate set-dressing and stilted dialogue he always seems to employ and the emotional core of what a good story should be.It was only after I watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) did I realize his potential not as a filmmaker but as a creator of worlds. Steve Zissou was once again disappointing in its narrative but managed to be something altogether different from the turgid dryness of Rushmore (1998) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and Moonrise Kingdom (2012) successfully took advantage of an all encompassing vision which made me much more aware of Anderson's true potential. It helped that his stories were more whimsical and entered squarely in the realm of crowd-pleasers instead of receptacles of arcane literary trivia. He also hinted at emotional artistic expression ever so slightly; especially in Moonrise Kingdom.The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is a happy marriage of Wes Anderson in all his forms; a whimsical visual artist, a pedantic Eurocentrist and finally an emotional storyteller. Ralph Fiennes stars as a philandering but thorough hotel concierge M. Gustave who takes young Zero (Tony Revolori) under his wing as the Grand Budapest's new bellboy. Gustave and Zero are forced into a series of misadventures when one of his elderly bedfellows dies bequeathing him a priceless painting.Thematically, Anderson seems to be playing around with ones sense of nostalgia. The story beseeches its audience into an unearthly place and time inside an unknown European country prior to an unknown war. The film begins with a little girl opening a book narrated by ""The Author"" (Tom Wilkinson); her surroundings are snowy and stark as she stares at a yet unrecognizable statue. The Author recalls a time in his youth when he visited the Grand Budapest in the 1968 and met the elderly Zero (F. Murray Abraham) who had become a man of renown since his time as a bellboy. In these early scenes, the hotel has fallen into disrepair yet while there's evidence of muck and rust, the grandeur of the hotel shines through. He then tells the story of his predecessor who is never without his tyrian purple tuxedo and bow-tie. By the time we get to the story within the story, within the story, the hotel resembles a wedding cake and even the bland colors of Zero's six by ten room pop out at you.Sometimes looking through rose colors glasses may skew one's perceptions of the past. The artifice of the film is always signature Anderson with a suspicious fakeness especially in times of heightened tension. Yet despite the fakeness and moments of dry wit and levity, there's more than meets the eye. There is a surprising bit of bitterness with the sweet confections cooked up by Anderson and his stellar cast which includes Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe. Like in Cabaret (1972), there's foreboding hints of fascism lurking in the shadows; ever present yet not actively driving the plot. Could it be a statement on today's modern political landscape? Could scenes involving Zero and the authorities who jostle him be a statement on immigration? Could the stark clientèle haunting the 1968 hotel, and the hotel itself represent the failed promises of Communism? Perhaps not but there's no denying such sad realities.The language in the film also serves and important purpose in highlighting the film's bittersweet sensibilities. Like in Anderson's previous works, the dialogue is very formal and composed juxtaposed with the farcical elements on full display. There are piercing moments of obscenities which provide a cheap laugh or two yet I feel they serve another purpose. The film reminds the audience, specifically the true filmophiles that while it may resemble Night Train to Munich (1940) and The Great Dictator (1940), The Grand Budapest Hotel is very much a product of 2014.Leave no doubt in your mind, The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's best film to date and certainly a film worthy of consideration. It reaches the apex of what the director's sensibilities could be which is to say entertaining, artfully done and literate. It's much more than a dotty wee skid mark and a pretty face, like Moonrise Kingdom before it, the film transcends and becomes emotionally satisfying, signifying that Anderson is finally willing to open up and evolve as an artist.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 January 2020,9/10,"Directed by Wes Anderson. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F. Murray Abraham, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldbum, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Mathieu Amalric, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton. (R)A writer recounts his visit to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where the owner (Abraham) describes past events that focus on the friendship between lobby boy Revolori and concierge Fiennes as they get involved in a dangerous inheritance game and the outbreak of war. Presented by writer/director Anderson in his trademark style of artfully-staged whimsy and symmetrical elegance, with greater emphasis on sophistication while being even more meticulously artificial than ever before--many filmmakers borrow, honor or parody his furbelowed trappings, but no one does it quite like him. The cast is over-loaded with talent, including bit parts for several members of Anderson's recurring troupe (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban, etc.), led by Fiennes in a fabulously droll performance as the dryly-witted and mirthfully-profane M. Gustave. Those who find Anderson's work too twee and precious for their tastes aren't likely to be converted, but it's as cozy as a peapod for anyone else, with eye-popping visual delights and the sort of heartstring tugs he found with ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that had often been absent in his earlier pictures. Oscar winner for Production Design, Original Score, Costume Design and Makeup & Hairstyling.87/100"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 May 2014,9/10,"I don't know whether it's psychic, fate or coincidence, but Wes Anderson movies always indicate a significant landmark in my life. Now The Grand Budapest Hotel marks my graduation from university. Does the plot have anything to do with this? No, but I will carry that association for the rest of my relationship to the film. It already means a lot to me. There is an irony with the films prologue in how the author says how he has writers block - stated in traditional Wes Anderson affectionate pretence as scribephenia. I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel a month ago and have struggled to begin reviewing the film. It's too rich and too dense. Anderson knows this. In the first 5 minutes we jump from perspective to perspective until we enter the meat of the story. It's a deliberate distraction to provide the amusingly tenuous connection of word-of- mouth myths. It's an interesting setup, almost as if Anderson wants us aware of his presence, but the film doesn't become a true delight until we're introduced to Gustave and Zero.Ralph Fiennes performance has been frequently lauded, considered perhaps the best performance in a Wes Anderson film. While he doesn't have the emotional weight of Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic or Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums, he certainly has the gravitas for it. Fiennes delivers a bitingly deadpan performance, balancing his composure from proper to explosive with captivating precision. Monsieur Gustave is a man who believes in the standards of The Grand Budapest Hotel and those standards are a series of formalities and conduct that seem rather frivolous. It appears to reflect the way Anderson designs his films, full of frilly but meticulous production design and conscientious characters. But Anderson isn't about these visual quirks, he cuts to the core. That's what makes his films so special because inside the core is a tragic undercurrent of loss and misguidance. This pretty and unique design is just the shell.Although we are allowed to learn of Zero the lobby boy's backstory, one that makes him an incredibly compelling character, Gustave remains ambiguous. In fact, it is difficult to imagine him as a boy or lobby boy. The heart of Gustave is his relationship to Zero, played wonderfully by Tony Revolori, a soon-to-be familiar face in Anderson's acting company I hope. Zero's anxious stares and awkward mumbles provide a brilliant contrast to the otherwise perfectionist world. A scene significantly repeated is one wherein Gustave protects Zero and it seems like an incidental obstacle on their journey. But upon viewing it builds emotional weight as it sums up what Gustave is willing to risk for another. Ostensibly an unusual moment. I imagine this will be a film has a multiplying power upon rewatch. Rushmore and The Life Aquatic took a little time to get the most out of little and now the Jaguar Shark scene makes me burst into tears even out of context. Gustave and Zero's brotherhood is the best duo Anderson has created since Max and Mr. Bloom.The Grand Budapest Hotel is certainly Anderson's darkest film yet. It takes the break-neck speed of Fantastic Mr. Fox and the lashings of violence and shoot-outs of The Life Aquatic and combines them to full effect. He even admitted that he didn't what he was doing with the action scenes of Aquatic and made them deliberately simple and pathetic. Clearly he has learned since. And it does appear that he has accumulated the aspects of the visual styles of his other films. There's stop-motion, annotations, elaborate sets and mini-sets. But it's not derivative of his other films as many have argued that Anderson is stuck in a cycle of repeating himself. In condensing his style for a 4:3 aspect ratio, as opposed to his usual incredibly wide angle lenses, it adapts the Anderson trademarks. The unique and cinematic distortion of the image is still present, but instead of the sides of the frame, it's now found on the angle of the character and the way they blend into the background as if they're integrated into his world even more than he has done already.However, it can be a victim of its dense 90 minute runtime. With such brief glimpses of many familiar faces, none of them are developed with such time devoted to a convoluted plot. Granted, they're certainly welcome to fill up all the bit parts as long as you're aware that it's a full house. Willem Dafoe, the antagonist, is the only one who's motive feels lacking but I guess he represents more than just himself. Nevertheless the film is a joy to watch - delivering thrills, wonderful deadpan humour and a sprawling imagination. Clunky at rare times but not as severe as Moonrise Kingdom's worst moments. None of this drag the film down, fortunately. It's too much fun. I do wonder if Anderson will have a film that hits the spot quite like his stretch of films from 1998 to 2007 but his streak since is still satisfying. There's a running joke in Grand Budapest. Poetry is always interrupted for a feast of vulgarity. I think that sums Wes Anderson up a bit. Serious, but not too seriously.9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 December 2016,10/10,"The story begins in 1932 during the hotel's glory days when the young Zero was a lobby boy, freshly arrived in Zubrowka after his hometown was razed and his family executed. Zero befriends and eventually proposes to Agatha, who is a professional pastry chef and proves very resourceful. Zubrowka being on the verge of war is of little concern to Monsieur Gustave H., the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. The owner of the hotel is unknown and only relays important messages through the lawyer Deputy Kovacs. When he is not attending to the needs of the hotel's wealthy clientele or managing its staff, Gustave courts a series of aging women who flock to the hotel to enjoy his ""exceptional service."" One of the ladies is Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (""Madame D""), with whom Gustave spends the night prior to her departure."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 October 2018,8/10,"This movie has a little bit of everything. It has comedy, suspense, romance, drama and visual appeal. It is the retelling of a story once heard from the mouth of Zero Mustafa, former lobby boy of the Grand Budapest Hotel. He tells of a roller coaster adventure he has with Mr. Gustove, his boss, mentor and friend, revolving around the death of a wealthy, elderly lady and a painting that she leaves to Mr. Gustove. As they become more caught up in the circumstances of greed, murder and concealment, they realize they must figure things out for themselves.I loved the way this film was shot. The colors were engaging for the eye and the shots were grand. The acting was top notch with cameo appearances in a script that was well written. The story was cleaver and while there were a few moments, for me, that seemed to drag slightly, it was a well paced film overall. It is something that I would recommend to a friend."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 December 2019,9/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has the rather peculiar narrative structure of the double flash back. In the beginning of the movie we meet an old writer who remembers an interview he has hold when he was still young (flashback 1). In this interview an old man tells the story of his life (flashback 2).Just like in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012, Wes Anderson) the story seems an adaptation of an exciting boys book, but it is (even more) over the top. Wes Anderson likes his films to be artificial. In his opinion everybody knows that a film is fake and artificiality does not preclude identification.Being over the top the film has also something of a persiflage. The character of Jopling made me think of Anton Chigurgh from ""No country for old men"" (2007, Joel and Ethan Coen). That was a persiflage of a Western but of what genre is ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" a persiflage? At first I thought of Agatha Christie adaptations, the disagreement about the heritage of a person who was murdered being at the core of the plot. At second glance I think ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" is a persiflage of Max Ophuls films, glorifying a society that definitely belongs to history.The world I am alluding to is the Habsburg double monarchy. This world is personified by monsieur Gustave, the hotel concierge who anticipates on the wishes of his (female) clients before they themselves are aware of them. Anderson himself has indicated that ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" was not written but was certainly inspired by Stefan Zweig (""The world of yesterday, 1942). Maybe the writer in the film is Stephan Zweig?.Given this references to the Habsburg empire it was a bit of a surprise to me that the war in the film is not the First- but the Second World War. To give his actors a hint of the ambiance of the film he was aiming at Wes Anderson mentioned ""To be or not to be"" (1942, Ernst Lubitsch), so it really is the Second World War. One of the others film he mentioned was, not surprisingly, ""Grand hotel"" (1932, Edmund Goulding).In the present tense after flashback 1 (the time when the writer is still young en when the narrator is telling his story to him) the Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely in decay. The design is seventies at its worst and makes one think of that other famous film hotel"": the Overlook hotel from ""The Shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 April 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson is nothing if not unique. His legion of art-house fans adore him for being fresh, chic and not conforming to mainstream marketability. Others only see pretension, pomposity and arty- fartiness (I'm somewhere in the middle). There should be nary an argument about the likability of Grand Budapest though, it's a cinematic delight from start to finish. Anderson leaves no artistic stone unturned; mixing genres, framing four stories (spanning multiple generations) within each other like a Russian nesting doll, toying with aspect ratios and even dabbling in black and white cinematography. The meticulously designed sets, lavish costumes and gorgeous lighting fill each frame with intricate beauty and are ideally accompanied by Alexandre Desplat's sumptuous score. It's all pulled together by Anderson's own cracking script, which supplies a fulfilling narrative and graces the huge ensemble cast with side-splitting one liners. And what a phenomenal cast it is. Outstanding as Gustave H, the suave and enigmatic concierge of the titular hotel, Ralph Fiennes leads a roster that boasts 3 Oscar winners, 8 Oscar nominees and, naturally for a Wes Anderson picture, Bill Murray and Owen Wilson. Uproarious, intriguing, dazzling and affecting – a must see for lovers of old-school cinema."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 July 2014,8/10,"I have never been fan of Wes Anderson's films owing to their cartoonish and funny sets with weird make-up. However, I was surprised to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel with utmost sincerity in terms of performance, story telling and brilliant direction.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells the adventure of Gustave H who is a manager at the The Grand Budapest Hotel along with the lobby boy Zero.Wes Anderson had changed my mind and feeling towards his film with sheer direction and convincing screenplay. The story is well-told in the flashback mode and narration is simply superb keeping you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The movie is a thorough entertaining and the prison break scene will add extra spice and is like an icing on the cake. Background score is superb along with beautiful cinematography and art direction. Editing is crispy. Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performances with wonderful dialogue delivery filled with humor and expression. Tony Revolori gives in an adequate support and should go a long way.Overall, a brilliant cinema to watch out for. Excellent 4.5/5"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 July 2014,7/10,"Wes Anderson's latest film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" opens at the elaborate Grand Budapest Hotel with a storied history located in the fictional former empire Zubrowka in Eastern Europe. Young Zero Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori) is an aspiring lobby boy for the famed concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). The elder takes Zero under his wing and the two begin a trek across mythical lands.As with recent Anderson films, this shares his distinctive artistic sense. Like he's telling a story through pictures. The story here is a quirky, idiosyncratic tale of mischievous and silly whimsicality. Random nonsense could also be a way to describe it. The plot, or a loose semblance of chapters of a related story, literally takes Mr. Gustave and Zero from satisfying old ladies, to art thieves, through a murder plot, to prison, a brief pause to fall in love, to escaped convicts and back to the noted Grand Budapest Hotel. It was quick and playful, also very far removed from any relatable sense of reality.But the interesting thing about the film is that it does serve as an odd viewpoint to the real, war-torn world of late 1930s Europe. Personally, I found the juxtaposition between the frivolousness of the story and the dark, grandiose themes of life to be too startling and moves the film even closer to random nonsense. However, this is also where the film shows off its unique, incredibly intelligent and endlessly witty dialogue. It is really funny and fits both the quirky, playful nature of the story and the darker tones of the times. The dialogue at least allows you to laugh your way through the film even if you don't form much interest in the story.As mentioned before, Wes Anderson is telling a story through pictures. Each shot is framed meticulously and symmetrically. I like his ""square"" way of telling more ludicrous stories. There are also a number of shot set-ups which allow for some funny jokes as the camera pans over to complete the scene. The production design is also very beautiful and fits the grand and eloquent, but also lonely, hotel. The colour palette this time around shifts more than usual, but the story also goes through a lot of phases. The hotel itself is bathed in a dull pink and purple, which is a gorgeous visual imagery for the overcast pall of communism and the lavish and hopeful lifestyles of its residents and employees.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is based on the writings of Stefan Zweig and it opens with a writer telling a story of an older Zero relaying the story of his life. Part of my issues with the film is that these characters don't resemble humans. Zero's motivations aren't clear and are not understandable, and Mr. Gustave is just crazy. And then they embark on an adventure that is just as odd as they are. The dialogue is hilarious and astute, and the landscape it all unfolds on is beautiful and elegantly created. It's a beloved film, but some will be unable to place themselves in that world."

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 September 2017,5/10,"'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a rarity in the world of film in that there's nothing really like it out there. It's one of a kind and is near impossible to categorise, let alone describe. It's a fascinating film to watch due to its sheer weirdness, but it's also divisive in that some people will love it and others just wont see what all the fuss is about.I'm probably somewhere between the two - on the fence if you like. I was entertained for most of the film, but the story did nothing for me and neither did the humour. For all its style, the film lacks a solid and coherent plot and ends up just being a silly and shallow little adventure.Its quirky and weird nature makes it memorable, but it's a film I'll only ever watch once. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an unusual film, but just not to my taste."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 December 2018,7/10,"I'm not a bit Wes Anderson fan but this was enjoyable, with great performances from all."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 November 2014,8/10,"Although it has a rather ordinary story, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is told in an interesting way, and with some of the most picturesque cinematic images I've seen in recent years. The story is about Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), who is the concierge of the titular hotel. He takes a young immigrant boy, Zero, under his wing as his new lobby boy. Over the course of the movie they go on a series of adventures stemming from the death of one of Gustave's many lovers, Madame D (an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) and a painting called ""Boy with Apple."" They also meet many colorful characters on the way, played by Wes Anderson's usual stable of actors. I must confess to not being the biggest Wes Anderson fan, and in fact, this is only the second of his films that I have seen, after BOTTLE ROCKET. There is a certain air of pretentiousness that one can feel about his work, like he's only making these films to amuse himself. Yet, there was a playfulness with this one and, in the end, a rather emotional turn that won me over. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the film and thought it was immaculately composed from a visual perspective. It was like every frame could be a perfect photograph, and this is definitely where Wes Anderson's strengths lie. I also enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters with which this film was populated. Though most of the big name actors who appeared here took what basically amounted to cameos, they brought a lot to the few scenes in which they appeared. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a great performance, especially Ralph Fiennes. Wes Anderson's flowery and poetic dialogue just flowed off of his tongue effortlessly, and with style. The actor who played a young Zero also did a fine job in his first role. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if typical Wes Anderson film. The story does get a bit convoluted in the end, but the stylistic choices and the way you are enveloped in this fantasy world overshadows any weakness that the narrative has. A definite must-see, especially for Wes Anderson fans."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 July 2019,7/10,"A story is told in flashback about the titular hotel in the fictional small country of Zubrowka in alpine Europe. In 1932, the hotel's concierge (Ralph Fiennes) is wrongly accused of murder of one of the hotel's wealthy guests.Directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, this film shares the same unique whimsy which Anderson showed most recently in ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The energy is always snappy especially with camera angles that move forward, backward, up, down, and sideways to display events happening simultaneously.The story and characterization are enjoyable though not especially strong. But with an energetic performance from Fiennes plus Anderson's playful direction, this film comes off as quite charming and entertaining."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 June 2014,8/10,"Setup and PlotWe start the film with an Author, in his later years, doing a video recording. He then promises to tell the audience how he came to know a particular story.We switch back to 1968, when the Young Writer was staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel, which was in its fading, twilight years. The Young Writer meets Mr. Moustafa, who tells him the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel.We switch back to 1932; the new Lobby Boy (Zero) begins his tutelage with M. Gustave. Gustave likes older, rich, blonde women, and he romances them. In particular, Madame D. is quite fond of him. She is on a trip, and has a presentiment of death. Sure enough, she dies in the town where she traveled to. Gustave and Zero hurry to see her, and are there in time to hear the reading of the will. The surprise is that she willed the priceless painting 'Boy with Apple' to Gustave. The family is furious, and Gustave is accused of her murder, but not before Zero and he secreted the painting.Mr. Moustafa pauses to describe his relationship to Agatha, who works in the bakery of the hotel. Agatha helps in the escape of Mr. Gustave. Then Moustafa returns to the investigation of Madame D's death, and the process of bringing the probate to a legally sound close.Mr. Gustave, with the aid of Zero and four fellow prisoners, escapes prison. Gustave reaches for help from his fellow concierge friends.In the counter-theme, Dmitri and his cohort Jopling, pursue Gustave for the sake of the painting, mostly.Will anyone find Serge, supposedly the real culprit in the death of Madame D. ? Do we get to know how Zero gets enough money to buy the Grand Budapest? Will Zero and Agatha ever get together legally? What will become of Dmitri and Jopling? Will Henckles re-capture Gustave or Zero?-----Scores-----Cinematography: 10/10 Fine job.Sound: 10/10 Well done. Sometimes wildly inappropriate but usually good for a laugh or two.Acting: 10/10 What a cast! Great jobs by most involved. No bad performances.Screenplay: 6/10 The main plot is so stupid it is beyond belief, but one assumes that was on purpose. I got several belly laughs, dozens of smiles, and double handful of chuckles."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2015,9/10,"I avoided this movie when it came out, since the last two films I've seen of director Wes Anderson, The Light Aquatic and the Darjeeling Limited, were utterly terrible. Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give this a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) helped by the bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori)Fiennes is great as Gustave, a cultured, suave womanizer specialized in wooing elderly ladies who sees himself as a beacon of civilization in an age of increasing barbarism. When one of his ""customers"" (Tilda Swinton) dies and decides to give part of her inheritance to Mustafa, her two psycho sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe) will left no stone unturned in trying not to give others what they think is rightfully theirs.This movie has an impressive all star cast. Along with those already named, we also have Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan, Mathieu Amalric and (in smaller roles), Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann. And Anderson's mannerisms and eccentricities are not so off putting here (well, maybe with exceptions, like what does the mole with the size of Mexico in Saoirse Ronan means?). Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 September 2015,9/10,"First of all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is quintessential Wes Anderson. It's perhaps his most crisp film yet, and his most gorgeous one. There's the Anderson-esque matter-of-fact humour (""Did he just throw my cat out the window?""), and his alumni make their cameos as usual. The production design and costuming are exquisite, right down to the elegant chapter cards. New technical achievements are evident; the miniature models of the grand pink hotel itself, the snowy trees, the observatory, the diagonal tram all contribute to the dollhouse aesthetic that Anderson has carefully manufactured before, but here it is in even bigger scale. Yeoman's colour palette is again lush, ranging from the ornate warm interiors of the lobby, baby pink walls and bright red carpets, the cold browns of the other mansion of Swinton's recently deceased character, the harsh blue tint of the snowy exterior. What about the contrast of the blue and the orange merry-go-round before that gorgeous shallow focus bokeh shot of Agatha? It absolutely personifies young love. Yeoman's planimetric approach is again visible, and so we get symmetrical close ups that double as POVs like that Agatha one, or the conversation between Gustave and a dying Madame D, promoting an odd sense of intimacy. The first train interrogation scene is particularly well edited with a sense symmetry and space, with only sparse master shot coverage. The storytelling device of the multiple timelines is visualised through several aspects ratios, the most prominent of them in Academy, or 1.375:1, and this serves the composition when Anderson can push the characters together and assemble them in layers like a family portrait. Like that penultimate shot of the group in the submarine in Life Aquatic, Budapest has a few examples of this; Norton's Henckels poking his head through the ground to address his men, the various compositions in the bright red elevator, the hug amidst mountains of pink Mendl's boxes. Like Yeoman's past work with Anderson, the camera rarely moves, capturing a scene dead on then letting characters walk or poke their heads in, adding to that painterly effect. Zero emerges from Agatha's trapdoor, exiting and re-entering the frame on the next roof with a cartoon-syle sense of movement and efficiency. But when the camera does move, it adds much energy, like the bustling way we follow Gustave through the hotel lobby, designating tasks here and there, all while interviewing the new hire. It's a effective debut for the two leads; Gustave asks why Zero would want such a miserly job, and he responds ""Well, who wouldn't - at the Grand Budapest, sir. It's an institution."" Fiennes shows the first sign of interest here, but still hiding behind that facade of the meticulous concierge. ""Very good."" And I tend to agree. Desplat's score here is sublime, not sweeping or grandiose but some of his best work in creating a whimsical but wistful mood for such a heavy contextual premise. It's an American film, and mostly an American production and mixed British cast, but Desplat's orchestrations reflect the context with its Russian Folk influence that utilises a whole range of more traditional instruments such as the balalaika, the mandolin and the cimbalom. The score is lively appropriately, combining percussion and choir with the miniature play-like aesthetic of the snow chase, and Mr Moustafa and Gustave's piano/strings themes are stirring and nostalgic. But the tour de force has to be the opening theme, a heartfelt two part harmony Appenzell yodel ""s'Rothe-Zäuerli"" from Swiss folk group Öse Schuppel. Budapest's narrative is delivered through a several layers of time and therefore nostalgia is deeply rooted within the story, twisting and morphing it. Several moustached Stefan Zweig type characters reflect his influence on Anderson's creative process; the yearning nostalgic pasts of Gustave and an older Zero, the fascination and careful listening of Jude Law which is reminiscent of some of Zweig's work himself (Beware the Pity). Most attempts at philosophical musings or recitation of poetry from the seemingly cultured Gustave are abruptly interrupted for humour or profanity. Or perhaps that's just a reflection of the more inner persona that hides behind the concierge. We seldom are allowed a peek under that facade, but Zero throughout the journey is offered a rare opportunity. The contrast between the first and last train interrogation is insightful; Gustave is indignant and protective in both, but the second time around the sense of partnership is strengthened so much that we already know what Fiennes is about to declare. It's shot in black and white, and so the war and reality robs the story of its innocence. Is it romanticisation in Zero's retelling of the story, as he canonises Gustave as a man of great courage and kindness? Whichever conclusion, Fiennes' performance is one of a kind, dignified but intimate with time. There's definitely interference when the tale reaches Agatha's role; the lights dimmer and cast theatrical shadows over F. Murray Abraham's tear streaked face, a cinematic touch that can in turn be attributed to Wilkinson's retelling. We view Agatha from a distance; she is a door barred from entry, its memories too painful to be unlocked by the elderly Zero. Agatha's fate is addressed with a few tender lines, Gustave just six solemn words to end the tale. Why does an elderly Zero choose to approach a young writer and share his story? Perhaps he means to illustrate that men like Gustave cannot be allowed to die out, even if the retelling is at times coated with a romanticised nostalgia or insincere humour? Perhaps he is like his own self described ""faint glimmer of civilisation in that barbaric slaughterhouse once know as humanity""? Or should we choose to include the ""f*ck it""? Gustave liberally applied a perfume to his life, with only one certain lobby-boy able to penetrate that illusion and pass on his story. As Matt Zoller Zeitz eloquently states, ""life destroys, art preserves"". And what a piece of art The Grand Budapest Hotel is."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,9/10,"When MGM invented the all-star movie with ""Grand Hotel"" and ""Dinner at Eight,"" the studio packed the casts with their biggest stars of the time: Garbo, Crawford, Harlow, Barrymore, Beery, Dressler. ""Star"" is now a much abused, much diminished term, and Wes Anderson's all-star ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" features stars of varying wattage. As stars, perhaps Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes come closest, although the large cast also boasts nearly-forgotten Oscar winners: F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, and Adrien Brody; one-time A-listers: Bill Murray; and capable actors who never rose above support: Willen Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Jeff Goldblum. Nevertheless, the familiar faces are fun to spot and help keep characters straight during the ensuing chaos. Most important, the stars, former stars, and never-were stars seem to be having fun.A stylish, self-consciously old fashioned film, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" unfolds in flashback as F. Murray Abraham tells the story over dinner with Jude Law. The complex tale involves Ralph Fiennes, who managed the hotel during its hey day, and his protégé, a new lobby boy. Fiennes preys on rich, blonde, older women, one of whom dies; the ensuing madness involves a stolen painting and the second copy of a second will, a prison break and a bob sled chase, a young romance, a murder, a shoot out; the movie has it all.The real stars of the film, however, are the superb production by Adam Stockhausen costume design by Milena Canonero, retro-stop-motion effects, and eye-popping cinematography by Robert D.Yeoman. The film is presented in widescreen during the contemporary scenes, but switches to the nearly square aspect ratio of the 1920's and 30's when the action flashes back in time. The camera shots are often straight on and perfectly symmetrical, although sometimes shot Busby Berkley-style, straight down from overhead and, again, perfectly symmetrical. Camera movements mimic Kubrick and either push forward or glide sideways parallel to the frame. The stop-motion effects recall Melies and the earliest days of cinema in their flat simplistic style, and the obviously fake backdrops of Ruritanian scenery could have been done for an early-1930's Hitchcock. While not a direct copy or parody of old movies, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an affectionate homage to a bygone era of film-making.While the all-star cast is as bright as stars get these days, directorial and designer style is the true super-star of Wes Anderson's film. The action is visual, the acting is broad, the plot is full of holes, but the cast, director, and crew evidently had great fun assembling the parts into a vastly enjoyable whole. The film is a big colorful bon bon, a fluffy cotton candy confection that leaves little behind except a pleasantly sweet aftertaste. Similar to ""The Artist,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" evokes the Golden Age of Hollywood; it's the kind of movie that audiences say they don't make anymore, but occasionally do."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 September 2014,9/10,"(90%) A vibrant, although somewhat bleak in parts, yet very wonderful comedic cinematic treat. No film quite feels, looks and sounds quite like this, it's a real marvel. The direction is perfectly calculated and every single scene, or even shot, is finely framed to a tee. The performances from the vast and famous cast are sublime with Fiennes leading the way with a note perfect turn, and the writing is impeccable and very funny. The sheer quality throughout of every single aspect cannot be denied by even the most fussy of film fan. This comes highly recommended to anyone in favour of quality fimmaking in their comedy, and I cannot wait to see this again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 February 2020,9/10,"I'm not sure how Wes Anderson managed to out-Wes Anderson himself, but this film is proof.
Take all the main elements of all his previous films, boil them down to their purest forms and mix them together and this is what will result. I'm not necessarily saying that this is a bad thing, but the forced symmetry and centering, bright colors, and quick dialogue all are a bit overwhelming at times.
This film is not without its humorous moments, but its true charm comes in the aforementioned visual style. I almost have the feeling that this was the film Wes Anderson wanted to make all along . . ."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 May 2014,9/10,"What is the goal of a hotel? Some might say it is to make you feel at home. Some may say that it is supposed to be a place of convenience where our vacations are easier. I think that the goal of every hotel, grand or motel, is give something that guests can't have in their ordinary lives; a sense of royal treatment. It's unlikely anyone reading this is a grand princess from a European nation or something. But when we stay at a Marriot, were not going to stay in one of their rooms, we are given the key to our room where for the next couple of days, we are to be serviced as much as possible.You could say that because were already paying the hotel, were going to receive special treatment anyway. But even if we only throw fifty-five dollars for a room on the side of a highway, were still given the privilege of having a room to ourselves with our own cook, cleaner, and someone at the front desk to answer our questions. We don't go on vacation for the room; we go for service and for people to wait on you for every move. The chronicles of a most interesting hotel butler and his student are captured by Wes Anderson in The Grand Budapest Hotel.This is a story within several layers. It starts in the present with a girl reading a book, when it cuts to the author (played by Tom Wilkinson) telling the audience his inspiration for his stories, which cuts again to the author as a young man (played by Jude Law) speaking with the current owner of the failing Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham). Despite the hotel falling a part in the movie's fictional nation of Zubrowka, Zero can't let the place die. When asked by the author, Zero then starts to tell his days as a young man when he started working.The owner's story starts in 1932, where Zero is a quiet Lobby Boy working at the Grand Budapest that's about to be stuck in the middle of a war in Zubrowka. This does not bother the devoted concierge, Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) who takes pleasure in serving the richest guests, including Madame D (played by Tilda Swinton). She's murdered one night and Gustave and Zero travel to the funeral, where the concierge finds that he's inherited a priceless painting. This pisses off the rest of Madame D's family; so many of them are sought on revenge. To make things worse, Gustave is accused of murdering Madame D.This may seem like a lot of story for a mystery, but The Grand Budapest Hotel is actually a very intriguing movie. Though the story is a good story, it's not the big focus. It's intentionally structured in an uneven manner going from Hotel study to art to communist war to a who did it mystery. Like a lot of other Wes Anderson movies, the overall style is the best part.This director is one of the few in Hollywood who have a distinguishable look for their movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel is just beautiful from it's old-fashioned sets, models, and even ratio. It's hard to describe why I like it in writing, but it's very lovely. The writing may be odd, but it still got plenty of laughs out of me. We have the actors to thank who all fit their parts well (including other parts from Edward Norton, Bill Maury, and Jeff Goldblum), never playing themselves. It's a grand trip from check in to check out. It's a visit that people will want to make over and over.I'll give this nine lobby boy hats out of ten. The Grand Budapest Hotel is keeping a good place on the top ten box office hits, and I'm glad. This deserves to be a hit."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 April 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most entertaining and fun times I have had at the movies so far this year. With an elaborate and all star cast, plus Wes Anderson's usual original and eccentric type screenplays and beautiful cinematography, music and a brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes, make this film a definite must see at the theatre. The film has it's own unique look and style to it which is very pleasing to the eye as well as suiting the setting and tone of the film as well. The performances are all great here, but I have to single out, Ralph Fiennes, as our lead character M. Gustave. This is a character who is suave, classy, charming, funny and one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a film in quite awhile. Fiennes plays this character to sublime perfection and it is an absolute joy to watch this character and Fiennes portrayal of him on screen. Fiennes has been nominated for two Oscars before, but has never won and I sincerely hope that The Grand Budapest Hotel, will become his third nomination and maybe even first win. It was just such a lively and spirited performance and as I said both a joy and very entertaining to watch because of how well written the character is, plus Fiennes' top notch performance. The writing here by Wes Anderson, is brilliant as is most of his screenplays and while I have admired every film I have seen by him (Bottle Rocket is the only one left I have to see), I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is both is strongest and best film since 2001's The Royal Tenenbaums. Sometimes, I feel that some of his later films have a little more style to them than substance, and while I still have liked everything he has done, I think I still do prefer his earliest films such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums the best. While, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is certainly high on style from it's elaborate sets, costumes and makeup and while it is an absolutely gorgeous film to look at, I did not find the style overwhelmed the film, or took away from the story in any way. Some of his films I have had that criticism with to certain degrees, but here I think Anderson found the perfect balance of both style and substance. It has an absolutely wonderful screenplay full of fascinating and well written characters as well as a lot of action, adventure and humour along the way as well. Going along with this wonderful story is a lot of beautiful cinematography, sets and art and set decoration which further add to the film and give it an amazing look that seems relatively familiar to us, but at the same time, also like nothing we have ever seen before. I like how Anderson chose to do a period piece film and add elements of old cartoons and spy novels and movies to the film to further enhance the action, adventure and overall fun sense that the film carries with it from start to finish. I know that Wes Anderson's films are certainly a required taste and are definitely not for everybody. I have shown his films to people in the past and they didn't care for them at all and I have also read film reviewers who just never got his work, or understood the appeal people find with his films. Although while reading some reviews of The Grand Budapest Hotel, I did notice that some critics who usually did not care for Wes Anderson's work, that this time around they changed their minds and really embraced and found a lot to like with The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps that is because in certain ways it is one of Anderson's most accessible films because of it's high energy and fast paced script and direction. Also, I would challenge almost anyone to sit through this film and not find it fun and entertaining. I think you would find few who would disagree. Still, I fear there will be some who just will not be able to get into the film finding it perhaps too quirky, or offbeat for their tastes, but at the same time for anyone who maybe has never liked Anderson's previous works, or are new to his body of work, I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great place to start. I hope that because of this film's release early in the year that it will not be shunned, or forgotten come next Oscars season. There is plenty the film could be nominated for such as Best Actor (Fiennes), Best Original Screenplay as well as cinematography, makeup, costume design and art direction. I think based on the excellent reviews the film is receiving that is still could be fresh in voters minds come next fall, or winter, so hopefully it does get some nominations and maybe even Anderson his first Oscar after three nominations and no wins. As for The Grand Budapest Hotel, it is simply sublime in every way possible and I laughed, was entertained and in a perpetual state of joy as I watched this wonderful piece of creativity and art. I had an absolute blast and I think many other viewers will as well, so if this film is playing anywhere near you, be sure to see it now because the theatre is the right place and atmosphere to do so. As it remains, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of 2014 so far."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 March 2014,6/10,"Wes Anderson has a distinct style. He's movies have a look and his actors perform in a style that is almost cartoon like. Perhaps it is how they run in the frequent chase scenes.If you like Wes Anderson's style you will like this latest effort. It's a story about a guy telling a story about a guy telling a story plus or minus a guy telling a story. It is great fun trying to recognize the array of stars going through their paces.The film is bright and looks good on the big screen except he keeps messing with the screen size and aspect ratio depending on which guy is telling the story. There's a fast pace uplifting score. The cinematography makes every scene look like a greeting card.Anderson fans will stand and cheer, most everyone else will have a pleasant time at the movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 June 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson makes movies so idiosyncratic - the surreal humor, the whimsical bittersweet tone, the distinctive visual style with pastel color palettes and quick cut-aways, weird but sympathetic father figures - that if you ended up 200 years in the future with a time machine and found a thirty seconds scene from an unreleased film by him, you'd recognize it at once. Of course, a deadpan Bill Murray would be in it somewhere.A choral story focused on a murder mystery and a mitteleuropean luxury hotel, the movie finds its center in the relationship between concierge Gustave (Ralph Fiennes in a phenomenal comedic performance) and his lobby boy and protegé Zero (Tony Revolory). Among the rest of the cast, Willem Dafoe as an ogre-like hit-man and Saoirse Ronan as a young baker have the most significant roles, plus Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham providing the narrative frame as a writer interviewing an adult Zero. Anderson's veterans Murray, Wilson and Schwartzman get cameos.The director crafts his tableaux with meticulous attention. See how the unstoppable determination of Dafoe's killer is conveyed through his constant movement, as he appears to be menacingly propelled towards the viewer; how the passage of time at the Grand Budapest is portrayed with a change in the dominant color palette; how mentor Gustave occupies the left side of the screen and Zero the right one in their scenes together, only for this to be reversed with older Zero and the writer.The Grand Budapest Hotel is more Anderson quirkiness - since nobody else at the present does what he does, it's quite welcome. To quote the movie, he certainly sustains the illusion with marvellous grace.8/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 October 2021,5/10,"I'm no fan of Wes Anderson movies and Grand Budapest Hotel is sadly no exception. It's quirky, easy on the eye and often quite funny but at all times it feels like you're watching a stage production that thinks it's cleverer than it actually is. Fiennes, however, is absolutely sublime."

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,8/10,"My Aunt Tetka lived most of her 101 years in Bayonne, New Jersey but she never learned to speak English well at all. Who needed The New York Times, Kennedy's inauguration speech, or William Shakespeare? Aunt Tetka could sing all one hundred verses of Slovak folksongs. Visiting Aunt Tetka was a trip to another world, a world she took with her when she (finally!) died. There were many curtains. The air was inside her home was as thick as soup. It smelled sweet, like Uncle Strecko's pipe smoke, and pungent, of cabbage, onions, and ham. There were sepia photographs of grim faced men with serious mustaches and women in embroidered babushkas, oil paintings of peasant huts and high mountains, figurines of goose girls, brass ornaments incised with pagan sun symbols and a graphic crucified Christ. Aunt Tetka consumed only pastries, sprinkled with powdered sugar, served on handmade doilies. Five minutes into Wes Anderson 2014 film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" I was weeping. Anderson took me back to Aunt Tetka. Mitteleuropa means ""Central Europe"" in German. Mitteleuropa has had many meanings, some of them frightening, geopolitical, and military. The friendlier Mitteleuropa references musics, languages, cuisines, colors and attitudes of Central Europe, an area stretching roughly from Germany to Ukraine, from the Baltics to the Balkans, a region sharing slivovice, zither and cimbalom, Gypsies, irony, pastry, sentiment, Catholicism, Judaism Orthodoxy, empire and cataclysm. Given recent news events, Mitteleuropa is much in the news: today we speak again of Cossacks, Crimea, and empire. There aren't many American films that encapsulate the feel of Mitteleuropa. ""The Third Man"" comes to mind, with its famous zither score. There's the original Bela Lugosi ""Dracula"" and ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Most of these films emphasize the dark side of the region, and that's too bad. Mitteleuropa has a rich tradition of joy and humor. It's remarkable that Anderson, an all-American filmmaker produced ""The Grand Budapest Hotel.""When watching this film, I really wondered how much of it the audience would understand. GBH so tenderly reflects the peculiar history and experience of Mitteleuropa. For example, the movie is told as a reminiscence by a writer remembering an encounter from his youth with another person who retells the life story of yet another person. Why this ""as told to as told to"" feature? Why not just present the narrative directly? The ""as told to as told to"" feature adds to the feeling of a lost world, of the antique, of a word-of-mouth story that is not reflected accurately in official histories. If you read the official histories of Mitteleuropa in the 20th century, you read of battles and massacres. If you know the people from Mitteleuropa, you encounter warmth and humanity and fate and humor and hair's breadth escapes and moments of generosity and grace that never made it into official histories. If you hadn't gone to that one déclassé health spa in the Zubrowkian Alps, you never would have met that one person, and never learned the story of Monsieur Gustav, and the tiny nation of Zubrowka would always be a mystery to you. The opening scenes, in rapid succession, show the Grand Budapest Hotel under communism, and then in its glory days, under something like the Hapsburg Empire. These very brief juxtapositions are brilliant. They really capture what those of us who traveled to Mitteleuropa saw under the Soviet system, even the creepy green paint. Monsieur Gustav is a concierge and gigolo. While training a new lobby boy, Zero, Gustav becomes entangled in a family scandal, a heist, and a prison break. There is a war in the background. For all its silliness, the movie brings M Gustav to life. Ralph Fiennes MUST receive an Academy Award nomination, and he really ought to win. He plays his part completely straight. His deadpan delivery of funny lines and his commitment to M Gustav brings this parody character in a wacky film to complete life. You love Gustav. You admire him. He moves you. You care about his fate. Tony Revolori is very good as Zero Mustafa, Gustav's protégée. His relationship with Gustav is adorable. The movie moves at a surprisingly brisk pace. The film itself may be looking back with nostalgia, but it is an action film. There is a genuinely exciting chase scene on skis. GBH doesn't attempt to honor the horrors that took place in Mitteleuropa in the 20th century. The Holocaust is just one of these horrors; there was also the Holodomor, the mass migration of starving peasants to the US, battle casualties, and too many other atrocities to mention. There are scenes where characters speak of being displaced and on the run, of families massacred. The viewer knows what Anderson is referencing. At one point the GBH is taken over by evil forces whose insignia, a design close to a swastika, appears on banners draped all over the hotel, in the same way that a swastika was draped over the von Trapp home in ""Sound of Music."" Anderson's answer to this evil is M. Gustav: be kind, be a friend, and be quietly clever. Make connections with other humans. Do favors, and rely on favors. This focus on the ordinary gestures of good hearted people in the face of enormous evil is deeply touching. I wish there had been more women in this film. Saoirse Ronan is the one female part of note, and she speaks in an Irish accent as sharp as a blade that totally took me out of the film. Her screen presence is cold and not fitting. I wish there had been more peasants, and more outside scenes. Mitteleuropa was built on peasantry and GBH needed at least one buxom earth goddess binding sheaves of wheat or milking a cow."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 December 2017,9/10,"An old man tells the story of his youth at the famous hotel to a young writer, together with its adventures and perils which ultimately led to his position in the present day. Then, he worked as a lobby boy for a very odd but perfectionist concierge, which involuntary gets involved in a dodgy testament, filled with crimes and murders.Their adventures are told in an unique way, funny, entertaining and unpredictable, having a hard time keeping even a single moment of sobriety. Although interesting most of the time with its dark atmosphere, it disappoints me with its simplistic and inconclusive finale. Its actors play superbly, especially the concierge, which puts a lot of soul and hard work into his character. It's a very good movie, worthy of an Oscar nominee, if not more, which brings some well-rounded characters and together with a good story, managing to create a truly great movie, if you count out the ending."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2020,8/10,"At some point in Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" - when you get past the shock or surprise of the strength in depth that is the stellar cast present here (often only briefly) - you'll realise that you are watching a movie whose look, brilliance, storyline and way of highlighting things most likely owes more to the cartoon than film-making.And of course the cartoon emerged out of history to allow people to say strong things about the world and what is wrong with it in a funnier, perhaps lighter way.This piece is no exception, but it's a flawed masterpiece - as so many are. In the first place, it takes the risk - a serious one - that many a viewer is REALLY going to say ""why should I care?"" And this is a danger that arises as easily 70 minutes in as at the start. The film is so surreal and so much of a pastiche that again and again one is tempted not to care. What held me in for the duration was the AMAZING visual side and the obvious fact that somebody in there was actually trying VERY hard with all this.But - BE WARNED - you'll probably ONLY get your deepest feelings about this work a few minutes before the credits roll, and that's a mean way to treat an audience. Big SPOILER then, for the sake of encouragement - if you're like me, you'll suddenly realise (if the title doesn't make it clear) that you have been watching some kind of extended metaphor for the cruel things that happened to the Eastern Bloc from the 1930s through to the 1980s. And indeed those final credits roll - paradoxically - to an AMAZING Russian balalaika theme tune from a very gifted Alecandre Desplat.You might need this injection of depth from me, because at first glance the eccentric and overtly-""meaningless"" story presented about employees in a hotel of fading glory (at moments facing challenges of war and oppression) will look sharp and funny-ish, but in the end also dullish. And at times just too incongruous to live with. Who knows if we are looking for any ""reality"" in this movie? But if we are, then the delicacy and elegance and fastidiousness of Ralph Fiennes's starring character M. Gustave DO NOT correlate with his frequent resort to four-letter words. The 1930s were not like and a character such as his was not like that. And so this looks like an absolute own-goal from the makers, or indeed like a deliberate attempt to repeatedly shock us out of taking this thing seriously or treating it as anything other than an artificial arena.Don't know about others, but I (probably) don't actually come to a film to be slapped in the face repeatedly. This work seeks annoyingly often to bury sentiment under crude farce, even though it's ultimate goal is actually really and truly a sentimental one. Why do that? It looks awfully like deliberately hurting your own fans and followers...For all that, ""Hotel"" may offer you an experience you've rarely had elsewhere (conceivably a bit in, say ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938)). Some may even concede that they've NEVER seen anything quite like it.And there must be SOME merit in that...!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 February 2021,8/10,"""Maybe if you already watch some of a Wes Anderson movie or at least one you will already know the style of all of his film and that's why all the amazing cinematography and all of his things is not making me surprise anymore even though it still an amazing thing especially for you who watch Wes Anderson movie for the first time, i still like this movie but not a lot, i think the cinematography is amazing but like i said before not too impressed me anymore, the perfomance is amazing, the editing is amazing, the set is terrific, the music is good too, but i'm just not a big fan of the story, i don't know, the story it just pretty basic and nothing special, but overall The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably not the best Wes Anderson movie and i'm still picking Moonrise Kingdom to be my all time favorite Wes Anderson movie but it still a terrific piece of work, i highly reccomended"""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the latest from Wes Anderson, and what great fun it is. My review of Monuments Men pointed out that putting the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray and Hugh Bonneville in the same film was no guarantee of a good film. Following that logic, what should we make of the following turning up together: Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Owen Wilson and (a wonderfully made up) Tilda Swinton? The answer is a near masterpiece of cameos that add up to a highly entertaining and memorable film.In a complex serious of flashbacks, Tom Wilkinson plays an author remembering his younger self (Jude Law) being recounted, a number of years before, the life story of The Grand Budapest's mysterious elderly guest Zero Moustafa, played by Abraham. (Are you still with me?) Featuring strongly in this life story, Ralph Fiennes plays hotel concierge and lothario Gustave H., seducer of his elderly and wealthy guests. He is supported in this role – for everything outside the bedroom that is – by trainee Bellboy, and Gustave's protégé, Zero (in the younger form of Tony Revolori).Following the murder of one such guest (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is not surprised to feature strongly in her will, awarded a priceless Renaissance painting – Boy with Apple. This is much to the displeasure of her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and his evil henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe). What follows is a madcap pursuit across snowy landscapes, various grisly murders, a couple of civil wars, some disconnected fingers, a prison break and a downhill ski chase.All the cast seem to enjoy themselves immensely, but it is the production design and cinematography that really shines through: every single shot of the film is just a joy to look at, from the bright pastel colours of some scenes to the oak-panelled finery of the elderly lady's mansion. Beautifully crafted, beautifully lit,beautifully costumed, beautifully filmed. Bringing a film out so early in the new Oscar-year must be risky: but one can only hope that the voting members have a long enough memory to recognise this movie in these sorts of categories.There are some interesting crossovers to recent films: both 'The Book Thief' and 'The Monuments Men' were filmed – as this was – in Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam. No coincidence then that the steam train chugging through the East European countryside looked startlingly similar to that in the opening scenes of 'The Book Thief'; and if you have Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in town for Monuments Men, then why not stick them together for this film too? Simples! Alexandre Desplat turns up AGAIN with another quirky and fitting score.All in all, if you like the quirky style of films of the likes of Moulin Rouge then you'll love this. Highly recommended.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my archive of other reviews and while there sign up to ""Follow the Fad""! Thanks!)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 February 2020,9/10,"A joy. The saga of the Grand Budapest and its concierge. There is nothing like Ralph Fiennes in a comedy. It's really the saga of the concierge and his lobby boy. The two of them embark on adventures right out of a spy novel. One of the concierge's women is found dead, murdered. He inherits a million-dollar painting from her. He is accused of the murder. He is imprisoned. He escapes. A wonderful chase and gunfight ensues. Well, it's all wonderful."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 August 2015,10/10,"But there are a handful of directors who don't cater to money or studio execs, and continue to follow their vision and make amazing films. One that comes to mind is Quentin Tarantino. His films have always been consistently amazing and are always highly entertaining as well as incredibly well-made on every filmmaking level. Another director who follows this pattern is Wes Anderson. Each one of his films are consistently well-made, and are highly entertaining. In addition to that, both Anderson and Tarantino have a unique style that showcases them personally and their artistic mind.You can always tell just by looking at the visual image of a film if it was was directed by Anderson or Tarantino by how they use their camera. And if you turn on the sound, you can always tell by the score, music, and type of dialogue each of these fine directors write. When watching any Anderson movie, you are almost immediately transported into a whimsical and almost fairy tale like land with brilliant and witty characters that seem to be visions of old folklore and legend. Hell, even right down to the costumes, these characters that Anderson has created are iconic, as people dress up as them for Halloween each year.With Anderson's latest film, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', nothing is different, but everything is new in a big way. Anderson continues to wow us with his visual and audio style, even 13 films into his career without missing a step. It's very difficult to pick a favorite Wes Anderson film, and when I thought about this after someone asked me this question, I had to give it some thought. Now while 'Rushmore' and 'Royal Tenenbaums' hold a nostalgic value for me as these were the films that introduced me into Anderson's world, I'm gonna say that 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is my favorite Anderson film yet. And that's a bold statement coming from me, since his resume of films are all top notch. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is Anderson's WWII film.Like Tarantino made his WWII film with 'Inglorious Basterds' with it's own sense and re-writing of history, Anderson has made something similar. And boy, does it pay of on every level. Based on some stories by Stefan Zweig (who was born in the 1800s), this story follows a somewhat multi-generational plot of the owners and staff of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', which was a luxurious hotel back seventy years ago, but present day, can barely keep its lights on. The film is told in the form of a story over dinner by a man who supposedly owns the hotel and is one of the wealthiest people in the world.We travel back in time to the start of a fictional WWII where the Nazi party is called the Zig-Zag party. The Grand Budapest Hotel is in full swing with royalty, celebrities, and politicians partying, and staying for long weekends and events. The owner of the hotel has entrusted M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), a trusty 'head of staff' who services the high-end guests in more ways than one, particularly the elderly women. Gustave is in charge of every maid, server, clerk, and bell hop, and he runs a tight ship. One day, a young teenager who is named Zero (Tony Revolori) comes by the hotel in search of a job.Due to his determined attitude for perfection and willing to do anything for the job, Gustave takes him under his wing and makes him his assistant. One of the hotel's guest is a very wealthy elderly woman who comes to the hotel to get frisky with Gustave, and upon her latest visit, she tells him that she is scared for her life. Soon after that, she is found dead and Gustave is invited to her will reading, when he and her sinister family (Adrian Brody) and his bodyguard (Willem Dafoe) are angry that she left Gustave one of her paintings, which is valued in the millions of dollars. Wehn Brody and Dafoe try to make waves, Gustave and Zero steal the painting, which sets our story in motion that involves a thrilling snow ski chase, a prison escape, Nazis, a big gun battle in the hotel, and enough dry wit to last two films.This is more of a cat and mouse chase as Zero and Gustave are trying on the run from Brody and Dafoe, as they come into contact with quirky characters throughout who either end up dead or saving the day. There is a good side story of where Zero falls in love with a local girl who cooks at a great bakery as he shows his true loyalty and servitude to the job. Most of the Anderson regulars show up during the film, but only in small doses.The main people are Fiennes and Revolori, who give Oscar worthy performances. During the film, I had to remind myself that Gustave wasn't a real guy, and that it was Fiennes playing the role. It's that good. Being a war film, yes there is blood and gore, as well as some great gun sequences, but it is done in that famous Anderson style that makes it all seem magical. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an amazing film and has Anderson pushing his talent and eye in new and creative directions. If you see one movie this month, make it this one."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 March 2021,8/10,"Ah, my favorite fictional hotel. The story was very fast-paced. I was very hooked by the weirdness of the frame and the color of the movie. Among the star cast, Ralph Fiennes was the best part as he carried the movie with his charismatic personality and how fast he talked. Willem Dafoe as the hit man was also very fun. It's not his usual role, but he was quite menacing with his minimal dialogue and presence. I felt the story was not too fascinating, but the journey and the character interaction were enjoyable and entertaining. 8.5/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2014,9/10,"There is an art in film, and there is a film as an art, and there is a film as art masterpiece. There you have it folks! Forget the Mona Lisa and all those boring paintings, forget solo music concerts. Here you have it all! If there was a film which made film making an art above all arts this is it! Everything about this masterpiece is superb. Acting, dynamic plot, music, cinematography. You name it they delivered! There is not much more to say then outstanding, superb, film as art above all! I hope they will make more of those, in the future they will say, mankind in the beginning of the 21st century made some history! If only Stefan Zweig could awake and see united Europe he dreamed of, and perfection of good life and welfare of its citizens he would be pleasantly surprised. Stefan, rest in peace Europe is living best it ever lived, rich and prosperous and almost fascist free! Hardly you can have it better then this! Tonoght I am going to go to sleep with a piece of mind. EU lives!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson is a filmmaker that I consider an acquired taste. You either like his movies or you don't. His style of humor ranges from being strange and shocking, off-colored and off the wall, to intelligent and witty. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" takes this trio of humor and blends them into a masterpiece of comic cinema. The story is so simple that I can write a book about it. It's central figure, a Lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, tells his story about the concierge Gustave H and the adventures he shared with him. These include but are not limited to murder, creepy assassins, prison escapes, ski chases, war, an all out shootout, a girl with a Port wine stain that is shaped like Mexico, and a painting of a Boy with an Apple. One funny scenario after another happens with these two characters as they carry out their journey. Many gags are thrown in just for laughs while others require more thinking, specifically the reoccurring spoofs on past cinema genres. Aspect ratios change through out the film, key lights turn on off, a blade is referred to as ""the throat slitter,"" and even Adrian Brody walks in slow-motion after a potential victim with a tensed-filled soundtrack. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a movie to enjoy simply because of its frequent gags and well-timed one-liners. It can also be enjoyed because of its great cast. Wes Anderson went all out on the type of actors he chose for his movie. Ralph Fiennes, Adrian Brody, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Owen Wilson, Saorise Ronan, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum are only some of the names in this film. Surpassing all of them, who would have thought that Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H could deliver such excellent comic timing? He gives us a character that is sophisticated yet memorable. His character is not someone to like in real-life. However, the audience cannot help but adore and cherish his personality. Gustave H is a manipulator of sorts and as such a character, Fiennes charmed the theater with boisterous laughter. I now see Mr. Fiennes in a whole new light. Voldemort, whom I've nicknamed him for a long time, can be hysterical. The rest of the cast members turn in good, quirky performances, but it is still Fiennes who steals the show. As already stated, the plot is straightforward. Nonetheless, it is fun. Every passing moment grows better and better. As the movie draws to a close, I feel as if I had experienced a comic journey that I want to relive some time soon. This is a rare film in which I can picture myself watching this movie over and over again and notice something new that is hysterical. Indeed, the gags go by fast. While I laugh at one, I may well have missed the following one. ""The Grand Budapest"" is a comic masterpiece of cinema. The average Joe can like it as well as the artistic minded moviegoer."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 August 2021,8/10,"The movie, the way that was directed, the brilliant colors of the movie, the comedy of it very nice to see. I enjoyed the movie. Wes Anderson made a very unique style in the colors and the symmetry of the camera. A very good movie with some memorable moments."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2021,7/10,"Great movie. Nice aestetic and nice characteristics. Funny, not the laughing kind, but the kind of funny that just gives off good vibes. Thats what this movie is, a good vibes film.7/10: very nice."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 January 2015,8/10,"Charming and adventurous flick about concierge Fiennes teaming up with lobby boy Revolori to prove his innocence after being accused of murder. Both leads are terrific and director Anderson's unique filmmaking style has really found its place with the masses, earning a Golden Globe and even two Oscar nominations. The film gets up and running incredibly quickly, almost too fast for a movie that takes place in a book within a flashback and within a second flashback—Anderson uses three different aspect ratios to inform viewers of where we are in the timeline. At 100 minutes, it feels like the cast and crew downed several quad-venti's and got to filming; seriously, the movie may have actually been better with a little fat, maybe an extra 20 or 30 minutes just so the audience can absorb what's going on. Don't mean to pry too much, as it is indeed an overall lovely picture.*** (out of four)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2014,7/10,"What is it that people enjoy about Wes Anderson's films? He is a rarity in an industry determined to standardise cinema. It is impossible to duplicate the tone and the direction of an Anderson film without drawing comparisons. Since his first feature Bottle Rocket (1996) his films have developed their own cult following because of his unique stylistic choices. His films are highly formal and dictated by deadpan humour, rapid fire quips and quirky details. There is also a balance between pure charm and humanity when he focuses on his most persistent theme, the family unit. Yet he has never been known for his restraint. By writing his own scripts, he can sometimes be his own worst enemy. He overloads his films with strange details that can feel overly ambiguous and purposeless. Audiences don't seem to mind. Moonrise Kingdom (2012) was the biggest hit of the seven films that he had made. It earned more than fifty million dollars, which says people are willing to embrace films that are unique and sometimes challenging. This year the Texan- born filmmaker is forty-five, which is a crucial age for any filmmaker looking to solidify their relevancy. How do you continue to make such imagination accessible to a broadening audience? The Grand Budapest Hotel proves Anderson is still navigating between independent filmmaking and mainstream cinema and looking for a new direction. While most of his films have centred on American families, this is the first story that he has set in Europe and also in a retrospective time period. His quirkiness and the humour are still intact but it's more accessible due to conventional and sometimes safer narrative techniques.The best aspect of the film is the lead performance Anderson draws from Ralph Fiennes. The actor is most renowned for playing villains, like a Nazi in Schindler's List or Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. Who would have known he could be so funny? His performance as M. Gustave, a 1932 hotel concierge, is a showcase for some hilarious comic timing and the articulations of Anderson's script. Smartly, Anderson has tapped into Fienne's theatrical roots. From the start of his acting career he has been as a Shakespearean stage performer. He knows how to control his voice, deftly fluctuating between being pompous and then shedding his sincerity. He plays Gustave straight so that he and the audience believe in every self-absorbed line and moment of vanity. There are some great one-liners in the film like when he gushes at what a masterpiece a painting called ""Boy with Apple"" is and then calls everything else useless junk. Yet Gustave's characterisation as a self- absorbed womaniser and his friendship with a lobby boy named Zero (Tony Revolori) leaves little doubt about how he will develop as a person throughout the narrative. Wes Anderson has resorted to using a very calculated character arc for this fascinating creation so that he inevitably becomes a much less selfish person and more caring for his young assistant too. It's surprising given how bizarre and unusual the director's writing can be. Nonetheless, Gustave's bravest gesture of friendship is equally the film's most chilling and unforgettable scene. It is darker than you might be expecting from an Anderson film.What is also surprising is how comically violent the film is. By being set in 1932, its themes purposely foreshadow the events of the Second World War. It is about the way that ""greed poisons the blood streams"" as Gustave says and how war and greed disintegrates institutions like the hotel itself, the Church and prisons. The Third Reich is Anderson's most obvious reference point, right down to including a murderous villain dressed in black leather. He also uses a range of technical choices to strengthen the ideas about institutions. In the contemporary scenes, the hotel is framed by a long shot to show emptiness of the building as an expression of its deterioration over the years. It is coloured with brown and orange tones to highlight its banality and the loss of its prestige. In the 30s period, the camera is fluid and unbroken, crabbing sideways as it follows Gustave through the corridors to show the organisation and briskness of the institution. The purple fabric of Gustave's jacket is equally district, reflecting prestige or royalty, which is true to the facade he upholds to his guests. The compromise one has to make about these ideas of war and greed is that Anderson resorts to set pieces that parody action film clichés to advance the story in the second half of the film. By referencing war and using a multi-tiered narrative that frames several decades of storytelling, Anderson is at the middle of point of his life, considering the uncertainty of the world. He is asking what stories he is going to pass onto others like his own family. As he is growing older, he is becoming more nostalgic, serious and melancholic, even though he still finds the hilarious and silly side of life."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 March 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is the Wes Anderson movie of Wes Anderson movies. Anderson's films don't appeal to all, as I have recently learned. But honestly, if you don't like his new movie, then there is seriously something wrong with you. I know it's still early in the year, but The Grand Budapest Hotel is easily the most enjoyable film of 2014 so far.The Grand Budapest Hotel is this hotel in some made up, Wes Anderson-ian European country. The film revolves around a man named Zero Moustafa (the older version is played by F. Murray Abraham). Zero tells the story of his life to a young writer (Jude Law). What's this story? Well, Moustafa tells of his experiences with former hotel owner M. Gustav (the hilarious Ralph Feinnes). Gustav is a playboy and a bit of a con artist. When his latest lay (Tilda Swinton, covered in fantastic make-up) dies suddenly, she leaves Gustav her most prized possession: a priceless painting named ""Boy with Apple"". The woman's son, played by Adrien Brody, doesn't take this well. And before you know it, Gustav is soon accused of murder, and from there, well, I can't share. This is such an Anderson film, and it shows. From the fake sets to the quirky characters to the lightning quick camera angles. Although not all of his films are great, you always know that they're his, and that makes them a little better. TGBH is far and away the best movie that Anderson has ever made. As a longtime fan, it is easy to say that.TGBH is dumb. In fact, it takes dumb to new heights. But it's the right kind of dumb. Not Adam Sandler dumb, but good dumb. think Airplane, but even smarter. Did I just contradict myself? I don't know. When you see it, you'll know exactly what I mean. This is the funniest, zaniest, and visually luscious film he's made yet. It's fun, and the fun never seems to stop.I can't wait to go back. I find it strange that they would release it in March, mainly because it might hurt its chances at Oscar glory. I have only seen five movies this year, this being one of them. Anderson shouldn't worry. I can't picture another movie this year being as smartly funny as this one. I loved this movie. Every second of it. The performances are right on target, and so is the dialogue. Everyone that gets the joke, nails it. There are many reasons to see it, whether it's for Anderson or for Feinnes' pitch perfect performance. Regardless, just go. It's a trip well spent. I haven't written a review since September. I don't know why, but I guess I just sort of lost interest in it. I have seen many great movies since then, such as 12 Years a slave, Gravity, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Her, but I just didn't have the energy. But seeing this movie made me want to write again. So, hopefully, it does the same for you.A+"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2015,6/10,"I gather that I was supposed to be thrilled by the ""artful"" use of color, costumes and props--especially color--in this production. And I did find it pleasant for what it was worth. It was also fun spotting celebrity cameos in nearly every scene. They were everywhere! A sort of ""Where's Waldo?"" in film form, with the hidden characters being Hollywood stars. The budget of this film must have been astronomical. But is it a great work of art?I am afraid that I disagree with the reviewers who are raving about The Grand Budapest Hotel. It was somewhat fun to watch, but the story, let us be frank, is rather banal and a weird mishmash of genres. Some may call that ""high art"" but to me it is more like a big glob of clichés from all of the different genres mixed together into one big pot. A mystery? A comedy? A romance? A drama? A slasher crime film (Dafoe plays a psycho professional killer)?This creation ends up being a lot of color and good props and an exercise in style, but it lacks the overall coherence and brilliance of a masterpiece. Star power and style are good, of course, but they do not alone suffice.Would I watch this film a second time? Probably not."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 July 2014,,"It's a Wes Anderson movie. So, there the whimsy, there's the ensemble, and there's the prose (and what beautiful prose it is).The ensemble - Ralph Fiennes, F Murray Abraham (we need more), Jude Law, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Léa Seydoux (unrecognizable, and sans any close-ups), Tilda Swinton (unrecognizable), Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Amalric, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzmann - though most of them are glorified cameos at best, and not all are utilized well, but that's a small complaint since the tale's sumptuous enough to ensure ignoring that your favorite actor doesn't have all the good scenes or all the best lines.The production design's perfect and makes the period come alive, making the sumptuous 35mm cinematography perfect (while I was wishing that 35mm and 70mm gimmick could've been done away with, so that the widescreen aspect could have been consistent throughout). One thing I did not get - why did it have to be fictional country? Who is Wes trying not to offend? I don't know if I missed something there.I also did not get the point of the multiple narrative-within-narrative structure used within the context of the movie. Felt like it was a device that was just used because it caught the screenwriter's whim/fancy, without there being any need to be relevant, or contextual. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of most of Anderson's work, and whimsy in general, but this was more in terms of just being put there for effect, nothing else, like the 35mm/70mm toggle, which also served no point except to ensure you got it that this one was not of the same period, which is clear enough without it having to be drummed in,, and losing out on the benefits of the widescreen aspect (I might've already covered it, but what the heck, I'm irritated whenever I think of it - what a friggin' waste).All in all, definitely not for the mainstream audience, and even for Indie audiences, and Wes Anderson fans, if you're particular about a few aspects of film-making be prepared not to take the majority opinion online at its face value, and to be (kinda, not all the way) let down."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2014,9/10,"Ah perspective, so much fun to play with, and have yours played with while you are not paying attention. In the same style, or even the same Universe as the Tenenbaums or Life Aquatic, we are taken on a ride of colour, and shadows, told with models, and grand sets that are stunning, and only enhance the experience. The cast is overflowing with talent, and as just one example of a surprise Harvey Keitel will not be immediately recognized until he speaks, and every one of the players right in front of you, or even doing something inert in the background are all full, and alive. At the deepest core of this movie I felt taken back to 1984, and the movie Top Secret with all of it's prop gags, and slapstick, that anyone old enough to have seen it would have to see it has inspired many great scenes on display here. I Enjoyed the perspectives the most, and did not even notice that the size of the area in which the story was being provided visually had shrunk to possibly reflect the fact that it was a story within a story. When I did notice I then convinced myself it had always been that way, and was suddenly overtaken by all of the extra splendor of having the full screen returned as the story wraps up. All of that pompous nonsense aside this movie deserves to be watched, and watched hard."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 January 2015,10/10,"Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is arguably one of the best comedic films ever made along with Some Like It Hot (1959), The Producers (1968), Good, Morning Vietnam (1987), Groundhog Day (1993), The Apartment (1960), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Roman Holiday (1953), It Happened One Night (1934) and so many more. As the film opens we see an author (played by Tom Wilkinson) who talks about his days back then while at the grand Budapest hotel (who is now played by Jude Law) and sees a man named Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham) and talks to him about his times with Monsieur Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) as the lobby boy of the hotel. Out of the 9 Oscar nominations that his film received I really think it should win 2 for best costume design, and best production design, the casting to this film is excellent (besides Fiennes, Abraham, Wilkinson, and Law) it also includes Willem Dafoe as a hit-man, Jeff Goldblum as a lawyer, as well as Wes Anderson regular Bill Murray as a hotel staff member, and Saiorse Ronan as the lobby boy's wife Agatha, as well as Adrien Brody as Gustave's nemesis Dimitri, and the unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as the old woman who stayed at the hotel for 19 years and was found dead in her bed from strychnine poisoning. When I first laid eyes on this movie I literally fell in love with it's humor, it's casting choices, it's story, it's set design, and it's costumes. This is one of 2014's best films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 May 2016,8/10,"Ralph Fiennes as always does a superb job, playing the lead role here of an eccentric hotel owner. The film is all about atmosphere and feel and it's got a very cartoony, tongue-in-cheek feel to it. The story is solid, the cast is great, and young actors like the young hotel boy and his fiancée are perfectly picked and it seems all decisions taken by the film-makers fall into place just right. It's certainly a fun ride and never lets down, taking the viewer through a myriad of various chapters in the adventure that is this somewhat outrageous bit of cinema. Some would call it 'precious', I'd say there's a bit of that in there, but overall nobody can deny the heaps of fun this represents at very least on the first viewing. Cinema doesn't always need to be profound and deeply philosophical, some films can be just great at what they do without any great symbolism or metaphor, and this is definitely one of them. You WON'T be bored watching this. Strong, catchy, excellently written/executed film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,8/10,"This unusual movie is a comedy set in a German-speaking country similar to Austria in the 1930s. The movie starts with beautiful Alpine scenery, a grand hotel with eccentric wealthy guests, formal old Europe manners and culture, and highly articulate dialogue (often delivered deadpan). The story is about the best concierge in the history of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", the ultra-suave, loquacious, dandyish, mysterious M. Gustave, and the series of adventures that led to his fortune and eventually his demise.The plot in a nutshell: after he inherits a priceless painting from a rich, elderly woman smitten with his, ahem, concierge services, M. Gustave battles to escape the wrath of the family, who accuse him of murdering her and try to get the painting back. This plot summary fails to mention various diversions, including the lobby boy, Mendl's pastries, the monastery, the toboggan chase, and the fascist forces closing in. It's not a natural or realistic film, but a highly stylised and richly detailed story within a story within a story. The film has a light-hearted, fast-paced, slapstick, madcap feel. I lack sufficient knowledge to identify properly the style of the film: cartoonish, camp and over the top are phrases that come to mind, but these words are too pejorative. Let's just call it a comedy of manners, a flight of fancy, stylised story-telling. When interesting stories are told, and retold, they become reimagined artificial reflections of what actually happened. Similarly, as listen to a story, we fashion in our mind's eye the visual details that bring the story to life. This movie is like that. It's not meant to be realistic. It's meant to appeal to a child-like fantasy view of 1930s Mittel-Europa. It reminded me of ""Hugo"" in that sense.This movie didn't really engage me or move me. It was more of an intellectual experience. After leaving the theatre, we were unable to identify what the point of the movie was. I suppose it was a character study of the remarkable M. Gustave (superbly played by Fiennes) but since the character was so implausible, the point rather escaped us. There has never been and never will be a concierge like M. Gustave. I suppose the point of the film was just to be entertaining and amusing and appealing to the eye (like the Mindl pastries, M. Gustave and the Grand Budapest Hotel). If so, the film succeeded."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 April 2016,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel tells the story of how the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel eventually managed to own said hotel. The movie is very unique, actually, and is not at all what I expected. The plot is one that is, while simple, easily made more complicated, and it is. It's not hard to follow or anything, it's actually very straightforward, but there's so much to the story. If I were to try to summarize the entire movie it could take quite some time. I think that this is part of the reason why I love it so much. It's simple but complicated. It's hard to describe actually, it's just really well done. The characters are good. They aren't totally focused on or anything, but they certainly are important and it's clear that there was a level of effort put into making them. They're all consistent and likable in their own ways, and while some of them can be a little exaggerated it fits. Everything in this movie is weird and exaggerated, so it all fits.The special effects are quite good. It's pretty much entirely done with practical effects, making it look like an older movie. Wes Anderson is known for doing this, and once again he perfectly captures the charm of older movies. Everything is very stylish and fun to look at. While it doesn't always look great or realistic, it's a style that Wes Anderson has mastered enough to make it still look great. Overall The Grand Budapest Hotel is great. It's funny with a great plot, solid characters, and great effects. I've had somewhat mixed feelings about Wes Anderson, considering I haven't liked all the movies I've seen of his, but after this movie I can confidently say that he knows what he's doing, and he does it well. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2015,9/10,"....look no further than a Wes Anderson movie. Yes, it's silly and theatrical, but boy do his films really stand out. He is unique. There is none that he seems to draw influence from or after. So, in that sense, his films seem to rise above the norm (obviously). But, atop all this, it is a fantastic story telling technique with a lot of heart. To me, it's always been like ""Rushmore."" A group of kids putting together a theater production that seemed to be put together by kids. It's a more mature toy box. A great joy to watch his bizarre characters do what they must. Thrown into an eventual spiral of zany-ness.I really loved this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 July 2019,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience like no other. Never have I seen a movie so original, creative and beautifully made.Wes Anderson is a director who clearly understands his craft and knows what he's doing. The camerawork is simply sublime. Every shot feels artistic in some way and works well with the time period the film's set in. The set design is gorgeous. The wide range of bright colours creates this joyous and retro feeling. I love the change of aspect ratio as the time of year changes. Each one is respectable and used to its advantage during each time period.The acting overall is just outstanding to say the least. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He adds so much charm and wit which adds a lot of likability to his character. As a debutant, Tony Revolori was brilliant and is a great accomplice to M. Gustave. Two other characters which I thought were amazing were Jopling (Willem Dafoe) and Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). Both actors portrayed them perfectly and brought some of the most precious moments in the film overall.Wes Anderson's script was something you've never heard before. He adds so much interesting and investing dialogues which embellishes the characters completely. Anderson doesn't stop his imagination from running wild. His story has a mixed bag of darkness, excitement and humour to keep the viewer from getting bored at any point. Accompanied with his stylish direction, the costumes, cinematography, score, set design, acting and crisp editing this fairy-tale like film is a one of a kind experience that has to be watched at any given cost."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 August 2014,8/10,"Stylishly made fun film that is engrossing every moment.It surprises for a good part of the film and that's the best part. From the time we enter the Budapest Hotel, it is an fun ride, the characters are interesting and have their own little stories that are comical yet emotional and thoughtful.The story of lobby boy (Zero Mustafe) or that of Gustave, or of any character, they are not very great to say the least but are interesting. They all together shape up this well made set piece that is mostly confined to the setting of the Hotel. The acting by Ralph Fiennes is a treat and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy is a revelation. The interesting part of the film I found was the use of varied aspect ratio. It differentiates the time frames intelligently. Wes Anderson is a director who oozes out fun in his films. His films are more about fun and the camaraderie between the characters. The shots are slick, the art direction is generally awesome and the cinematography is superb. The film is very appealing visually and all his films thus far have been stylish. There is enough substance in this fun story There is action, chase, fight, enough drama and even suspense. It's all well stitched and made the whole film an engaging experience. Of course, the script is the hero followed by superb art direction of the hotel.I am not sure, if this was shot on location or whether they erected a set, but it was just beautiful. The hotel, interiors, the painting of the exteriors and even the locales. This film shall be a 4/5 for the acting and the art direction alone. Thanks to Wes Anderson for giving us a good time at the movies yet again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 April 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson is pretty much the kind of director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small and unconventional it looks. Just like most of his films, the style and personality are written all over it, from aesthetics to pizazz, but compare this to the others, The Grand Budapest Hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which (obviously) makes it very charming. It is a part thriller and part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache, but looking deep within the structure, you may also find a bunch of witty humor and rich character development from the two leads which makes it a really special experience.The film is actually a set of layered events telling how many generations have reached the story of the past hotel owner, Gustave H. That strange piece of intro immediately presents the endless creativity of the picture. Some might think it's unnecessary, but it gives a lot of sense when the final title card appears, pretty much sums up the purpose of that period jump. But it doesn't stop there, of course. The whole film is an amusing multi-genre adventure that takes you to whimsically designed places. Even when it hits to the suspenseful moments, it still sticks to the lightheartedness until every color fades into black and white. It's a quite sophisticated direction, anything else is a pure delight.The aesthetics are an undeniable visual feast. You couldn't ask for anything more than that, the film adds plenty of quirky action within this fabulous looking world. The perfect blend of buddy comedy, mystery, and suspense is all what you need for this platform video game looking environment. But then, it's not complete without the joys of the characters. The real shining moments here is the relationship between Gustave H. and Zero. Ralph Fiennes is wondrous to the role. He made Gustave H. a very likable fellow in spite of his obvious insecurities and selfishness. But then it's an overall compelling performance. Tony Revolori also shines as his apprentice. The misfit pair sparks chemistry that adds more color to this already colorful world. The rest of the cast are just equally terrific at they are doing, whether it's to deliver great humor or give a lot of life in each scene.The Grand Budapest Hotel is often manic yet (obviously) often creative and witty. It's all classic stuff: it suddenly creates a captivating universe where its imaginations are free to express endlessly. I mean it even ends with an animated dance at the credits. Everything is not a surprise from the director, however it is still kind of a refreshing cinema. Because definitely it has larger than life painted exteriors, delightful characters, brilliant humor, and smart filmmaking that do not always exist in your everyday entertainment. It's just a fun caper that is easy to love, no matter if your interests to movies is mainstream or art-house."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 May 2021,4/10,A boring movie that only makes me laugh a little. Acting in the movie was good but Tony Revolore's acting was bad. The characters of the film were not interesting. The best of the film was the film's atmosphere and the decorations. I do not recommend watching the movie.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 November 2014,9/10,"This is my second Wes Anderson film, and yet another triumph for him. Ralph Fiennes in a rare comedic turn is a hotel concierge accused of murder. He tries to clear his name with the help of the new lobby boy. It's Wes Anderson so obviously it's not that simple. Mixing violence, sex, swearing, comedy, visual dazzle, drama, developed characters, a murder mystery and loads of weird and wonderful set pieces into a whole, The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been terrible. But it works very well. The visuals are incredible: With the inventive colour palette and fascinating angles TGBH creates a world of its own. Although emphasis on such a visually amazing world inevitably makes it feel empty at times and there are a couple of dips, this is a very good piece of indie cinema and it should be nominated for best picture at the Oscars this year. As both writer and director, Wes Anderson does a good job; his direction is visually stunning, humorous, gleefully stylized and at times suspenseful while his script mixes all those elements with surprising ease.The film, which was advertised with the best trailer of the year, is very well acted. Ralph Fiennes is delightful in his unusual comic performance and all the others are good as well even if many are blink and you'll miss it cameos. There's a delightful sense of nuttiness and quirk to TGBH and it's something you just don't really see elsewhere. It creates a compelling in film universe with mise-en-scene and visuals alone, and then populates it with lively characters and a rich screenplay. It's both funny, exciting and moving, and it's an nice break from the mainstream clichés which you'll often see in other comedies. This has motivated me to try some more Wes Anderson stuff. It's a really entertaining film if slightly empty and it's one of the craziest in the best possible way films you'll see this year. Expect loads of awards attention and some Oscar nods at the end of the year. It certainly deserves them.9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 February 2015,7/10,"Movies by Wes Anderson are an acquired taste. I wouldn't call myself a fan, but i enjoyed some of his previous creations, although i wouldn't recommend them to everyone. In this sense The Grand Budapest Hotel is his most mainstream movie which aspire to be more than a comedy.As it usually is the case, we're following a motley crew of characters. Situated in Central Europe they tell their stories of love, lust and fraud. Only at the end of he movie i've seen that it had been inspired by writings of Stefan Zweig. I dare say, Wes Anderson successfully transplanted Stefan Zweig's longings from The World of Yesterday (Die Welt von Gestern) from pre-WWI into pre-WWII surroundings.The Grand Budapest Hotel speaks not only to alternative movie aficionados but also anyone looking for a pleasant cinematic time. It never turns mundane and communicates to a broader audience, although it stays firmly rooted in the domain of weird."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2014,8/10,"Can a film be absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful at the same time? Yes. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' combines all those elements. And I didn't even mention the most important characteristic: it is visually wonderful.In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old-world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war (The Trans-Alpine Yodel) - Anderson has given thought and attention to everything.The story is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. All this is set against the backdrop of the Nazis invading Central Europe (although in Anderson's fantasy world they are not called Nazis of course). Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the looming war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it in an offbeat and almost comical manner.My favourite scene, in which it all comes together, shows concierges in hotels all over Europe, calling each other to help Gustave H. Each of them is shown in his hotel (with a wonderful fantasy name of course), busy doing some important job like tasting the soup or giving first aid to an unconscious hotel guest, when he is being called away to the telephone. Each hands the job over to his assistant, and answers the phone. This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch.Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel.The film moves forward at a breakneck speed. You have to be very alert in order not to miss something. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2014,7/10,"Wes Anderson serves up what might be called a 'romp-com' with this between-the-wars tale of the misadventures of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), concierge at a splendid spa hotel which manages to be located simultaneously in the Alps and Eastern Europe. Falsely accused of the murder of one of the hotel regulars (Tilda Swinton, made to look like a cross between Edna Everage and Miss Havisham), Gustave and his apprentice escape from prison and go on the run, aided by a 'mafia' of continental concierges.Gustave is more than somewhat reminiscent of Inspecteur Clouseau. Fiennes plays him with an appropriate klutziness that often pleasingly evokes the late great Peter Sellers. There are scenes which appear to pay homage to Stanley Kubrick (THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT) and even Stanley Kramer (IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD). There's an Alpine chase which calls to mind several ski sequences from the Bond franchise. F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody and Willem Defoe give fruity supporting performances; Owen Wilson and Bill Murray are among the many stars who contribute walk-ons, presumably just for the kudos of being in a Wes Anderson movie.This is a monumentally daft and old-fashioned movie, sometimes hammy, sometimes hysterical. There are a few misfires; the story-within-a- story-within-a-story is clunky (providing roles for Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson); the use of Miniatures is painfully obvious. But the cast are clearly having a fine time, and it's easy to be carried along with the merriment and mischief."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson's latest offering is perhaps his most accessible, perhaps his most polished, perhaps his most downright enjoyable. And, unlike many, this one even has a tangible McGuffin. Welcome to The Grand Budapest Hotel.The Grand Budapest Hotel contains a tale within a tale. The Author (Tom Wilkinson) recounts his memoirs, which includes the time when as a younger man (Jude Law) he dined with the mysterious Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Mr. Moustafa in turn, tells the story of Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) the former womanizing concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, who satisfies his elderly female guests in more than merely professional matters. When one such patron, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), pops her clogs, the adventure kicks off in earnest with Gustave on the run with his bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori).The Grand Budapest Hotel is unlikely to divide audiences, simply because those who savour Anderson's work will find this as delightful and engrossing as the best in his canon and those who don't 'get' him, won't part with cash for this. Like his 2009 gem, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel variously meanders in a carefree manner before kicking of with a rampant chase depicted in part with deliberately clumsy animation befitting Monty Python.As one has come to expect from Anderson, The Grand Budapest Hotel is packed full of deadpan, angular and quirky characters inhabited by an eclectic band of Hollywood's finest. Anderson regulars Owen Wilson (in a brief cameo) and Bill Murray play alongside newbies Fiennes, Law, Harvey Keitel, Saorise Ronan, Adrien Brody and Jeff Goldblum and at every turn there is another feast of performers and peculiarities to revel in.The sets are spectacular both in their grand scale and simplistic nature whether the hotel itself (in both incarnations) or the almost cardboard cutout cable car, and the costumes and make-up give anything Tim Burton can dream up a run for its money.There was a time when it looked as though Anderson's inventiveness was dwindling but with Fantastic Mr. Fox and, more recently, Moonrise Kingdom he has proved there is plenty more off-kilter gold to be mined yet, and The Grand Budapest Hotel is testament to that.The Grand Budapest Hotel is less like watching a film than listening to a magnificent story with moving pictures. It is a shaggy dog story, a ripping yarn, a splendid fiction played out by the cream of leftfield Hollywood. And like all the best bedtime stories, it can, and surely must, be enjoyed over and over again.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 September 2014,10/10,"Whether you love him or hate him, Wes Anderson has a unique eye and makes some very imaginative films. And ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" might be my favorite one he's done.For some reason, the more Wes Anderson looks like he is making a parody of himself with his usual style, the more I like his films. The more the colorful locales look like elaborate set pieces, the more outrageous the characters, and the constantly panning camera work, the more I am entertained by his works. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" takes all those tropes from Anderson and, as usual, makes them work in an entertaining way.And then there's the cast Anderson has a select group he likes to work with and, as usual, they're all back but the focus on this film was the absolutely superb and riotously humorous role of M. Gustave from Ralph Finnes. Yes, the rest of the cast is great and very funny but, Man Alive, was Finnes awesome in the film. His mastery of language, vulgarity, and body language really sold every joke and made the film a non-stop ride of hilarity.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is another wacky, odd, and eccentric ride from Wes Anderson and it is one packed with great acting and an all-out hilarious story. I really enjoyed this one! Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and other films that lack a Wes Anderson vibe) you can visit my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com. If you don't want to do that and hate that I even mentioned my blog, you probably shouldn't go. I don't want to hear your inevitable name calling."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 March 2014,8/10,"Entertaining, great characters (many of them!), magnificent cinematography, at times outrageous, sometimes violent, mostly funny, quirky, wonderful character sketches and buddy attachments - particularly between Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, unpredictably hilarious, Andrien Brody surprisingly menacing, Willem Dafoe the new Terminator, fantastic scenery, keeps you watching, never a dull moment, highly original, its like a moving canvas with constant surprises, dialogue is superbjust loads of fun with a neat story-lineWhat More Can you want???"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,5/10,"Prepare to delve into yet another intentionally bizarre Wes Anderson rabbit hole, guided by no less than three narrators providing flashback upon flashback... And then, somewhere in there, an actual story beginsSkipping to what's really important is Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, concierge of the neglected European GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL during the 1930's. He sleeps with spinsters and runs the place with an iron fist – more polished silver than heavy chrome. His young mentoring bus boy, Zero, the one narrating in the form of an aged F. Murray Abraham, sticks to his boss like gum while the duo, like the story, jumps all over the placeAlthough a real plot is chiseled down from a horde of bantering dialogue when an extremely rich woman dies, bringing Gusave to an estate where he could inherit, to the chagrin of her nefarious son, a pricey painting. The first half ends with Gusave and Zero stealing the painting, and the intrigue builds nicely. Then something happens Or perhaps, you can say, too much happens far too soonWhen Gusave is sent to prison, director Anderson abandons his quirky character-driven romp and throws several genre-devices into the pot, including a heavily planned old school prison escape and a ruthless hit man: The latter in the form of motorcycle riding Willem Dafoe, a cross between Steve McQueen and Al Pacino's muggy bodyguard in the second GODFATHER: Dafoe's mobile loon kills anyone connected to Gustave, including pets.There are darkly humorous moments here and here, and always something to gander at, especially the picturesque locations resembling popups from an antique children's book But with so much running around the central plot is all but forgotten, and Ralph Fienne's smug yet endearing gigolo gets lost in a mix of wasted detours and distracting star cameos (including Bill Murray, who could have been played by anyone)And last but not least, with the task of playing the true leading role, young actor Tony Revolori displays the perfect deadpan that befits hipster-friendly art-house fare, but alas, he's not that interesting or, in a movie full of mischievous devils, someone worth rooting for."

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 February 2015,9/10,"I really need to catch up on Wes Andersons repertoire, his film (the ones I have seen) are really delightful, playful and interesting and this is precisely that.I think it is one big artistic sum that makes this different and great. The way he plays with colours, they are strange pastels almost like something is missing in the colouring process like when your toner is almost out. The way the music and sounds peak the senses and indulge you in the scenery and the small weird parts of the scenes. The characters are strange but meaningful to the story, the are very explicit and each has their own charismatic way of just being and belonging. And off course the big picture of the whole story that fits very well together and ties all the visuals, sounds well actually most of your senses in, I would like at times to have smell be art of it, fresh baked bread, the mountain air etc.It is just a very complete film and even though it doesn't take that long to tell the story, it works out very well and is just intriguing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 November 2015,8/10,"There are three things that I believe makes this movie a masterpiece of comedy: consistency, passion, and charisma. The fictional world is consistent as is the style of humor. Normally this comedic consistency would limit the interested audience, but here I think it worked well because Wes Anderson and company didn't feel the need to throw in more marketable and LCD jokes that would have felt pushy and out of place. So by narrowing the types of comedy incorporated, they actually made it more broadly appealing. Second is passion, which you can see from every aspect of the film, particularly in the acting. I got the sense that everybody involved in the production of this film wanted to be there for the sake of being there and put their whole soul into their job. This mindset will invariably yield better results. Last is charisma of style. I know that this style of directing has been displayed in some of Wes Anderson's other films, but it's still worth noting. The geometric and linear camera angles work wonderfully, whether it's adding to the audience's slight smiles or giving objective exposition. Coupled with this is the unique color scheme and music score. There are actually a couple of instances where genuine suspense is conveyed quite well in the scene when Jopling (Willem Dafoe) pursues Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) and the scene when Agatha (Saroise Ronan) is pursued through the hotel.The plot is actually somewhat complex, similar to Clue, another classic murder mystery comedy. There are a lot of characters involved, but they're pretty easy to keep track of because all of them are played by well known actors, have simple names, and are given distinctly different personalities. The basic plot is that one of the Grand Budapest Hotel's most seasoned guests, M. Celine D., (Tilda Swinton) is murdered and the authorities have named Gustave H., (Ralph Fiennes) the hotel's concierge, responsible. This is coupled with his questionably legal acquisition of a painting given to him in the deceased's will. What ensues are a series of fast-paced misadventures involving Gustave H., his new lobby boy Zero, and an number of M Gustave's comrades and enemies. The story line in itself could probably have been used for a much more serious and heavy movie, but instead, they turn the horrific gasps into laughs.The narrator is a much older Zero Moustafa, but the story is really seen through his younger eyes. Zero pretty much gets swept away in all of the tumultuous events following Madame D's death. He is completely subservient to the whimsical, accommodating, blunt, poetic, and sometimes greedy Gustave H. Despite his other faults, he never seems to bear any real ill will against anyone, even Madame D.'s vulture-like children. The rest of the all star cast make up mostly minor roles. Most of them only appear for only three or so minutes on screen with a couple of exceptions. Agatha, Deputy Kovaks, Henckels (Ed Norton), Dimitri, and Jopling all get a lot of attention in a plot sense, but of these we only really connect with Agatha.I have limited knowledge of Wes Anderson's other works, but I would recommend this lightly whether you're a fan of his or not. If you aren't amused by the trailer, you won't find much more to amuse you in the final product. There's depth there if you look hard enough, though the whole thing about ""his world"" that the older Zero talked about at the end was a little confusing. I think ""his world"" was one where people didn't necessarily play by the rules, but were generally good natured and didn't hold grudges or anything like that. In that case, I suppose the movie was about how that world was temporarily corrupted and how M Gustave fought to keep it alive. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 September 2014,,"Although I don't consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, and I can't stand Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray or any of the Wilson brothers, the reviews of this movie were distinctive enough to get it into my otherwise empty DVD rental queue - but only because there were no other movies that I actually wanted to see.Now that I've seen it, I'm still not a Wes Anderson fan, and I still can't stand Tilda Swinton, et al - and now I also don't like people I've liked in the past, like Jason Schwartzman, Ralph Fiennes, Murray Abraham and Tom Wilkinson. Only Jude Law has emerged unscathed. Every time I see him I like him more.Wes Anderson has legions of ardent, devoted, cult-like fans, but I'm not one of them. His stuff just bores and annoys me, and his favorite actors are among the ones I most dislike even in other directors' movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 October 2019,10/10,"It's Wes Anderson's movie all the way. Visuals are gorgeous, characters odd and interesting and humor is mostly on the spot. Only thing I didn't really like was the movie's ending. It feels kinda abrupt, though it's not without it's strength. I watched it with a mate and we almost constantly laughed and enjoyed the charm of the movie, especially when things start to heat up. It really has the feeling of a good and memorable movie. I give it 10/10 and I recommend it if you want a fun and beautiful comedy movie crafted with love and care and not some rubbish that usually comes out of Hollywood labeled as comedy, when it's not even close."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 January 2015,7/10,The Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson and has been nominated for Best Picture Oscar. It is a story of a man sharing his life's story as he was a protégé of a famous concierge for a grand hotel. The ups and downs of life in the hospitality industry is quite an adventure. There is even a mystery involving a famous painting in the mix. A marvelous tale from an era when hotels were stately and full of wonder. This movie is a bit static at times and long winded. But the scenery is full of old school class. The shifting back and forth can be confusing at time. But the relationships are good and the characters rich.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 August 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson produces another charming adventure in The Grand Budapest Hotel that is full of interesting characters.We embark on a splendid adventure within The Grand Budapest Hotel told by Mr. Zero Moustafa, the one time lobby-boy and now lofty owner of the establishment. We travel back in time to the 1930's at the hotel's peak of grandiosity to meet the beguiling M. Gustave, Zero's one time predecessor and mentor. A battle of fortune and theft sets forward a monumental ordeal involving an insurmountable many.M. Gustave is a meticulous man with a taste for the finest comforts in life. Ralph Fiennes plays the bourgeois concierge completely straight and, yet, is the source of most laughs in this comedy and is wonderful to watch. The rest of the film is a who's who of well-known actors in fully realized idiosyncratic character performances. Expect to see Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, among others we've grown accustomed in a Wes Anderson film, though I won't ruin the surprise.When you look at the film in parts it is masterful. The visuals and sets are luxuriously stunning, beyond anything you could imagine and a dream. The acting is top notch and characters intriguing. The story is entertaining and funny and especially unique. The music by Alexandre Desplat is charming and complementary. And yet, I feel as though the film doesn't come together as Mr. Anderson wished.Wes Anderson films tend to be rife with characters and plot lines. The Grand Budapest Hotel jumps from each strand without fully completing or connecting at its conclusion, especially in regard to minor characters.While thoroughly enjoyable and charming as a film, if more time were taken to develop some subplots, remove others, and intertwine the rest, The Grand Budapest Hotel would easily have been one of Wes Anderson's finest creations.More reviews of films new and old can be found at our website!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 September 2021,8/10,"I'd never seen a Wes Anderson film before watching The Grand Budapest Hotel. People are always talking about his distinctive and unique style and they weren't wrong. It may not be for everyone but I absolutely loved it.This film in particular is full of wild and wacky characters, farcical situations, a razor sharp script, and just generally cool and kooky direction.The cast is superb. Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance that I've seen from him. So funny and charming and brilliant. Tony Revolori as the co-lead is incredible. The two had such brilliant on screen chemistry and bounced off each other brilliantly. The names on the cast list keep stacking up, from Willem Dafoe to Saoirse Ronan this film is full of talent.It has a superb plot. There are so many different elements and layers to it, all of them brilliant.What more is there to say about this film? It's fantastic and I hate the fact that I've waited so long to see it! Don't make the same mistake I did and watch it ASAP."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 April 2014,,"BY RYAN C. SHOWERSWes Anderson is a filmmaker whose touch is so distinctively defined in atheistic and a deviously aberrant tone that his work could be picked out a pile of miscellaneous films by a blindfolded crowd. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an amicable episode of Anderson's immigration. His exquisite visuals and fragrant tone may not be compatible for some, but thankfully the latest chapter of the auteur's diary internalizes most of its idiosyncrasies instead of besieging them onto the audience.Most of the heat encompassing ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is flowing from way of the screenplay (which is surprisingly derived from preexisting material), but I actually found Anderson's directing to be better than the script, which is not meant to discredit the writing. Anderson's tenacious vision for each and every mise-en-scene frame is ornamentally ravishing. Approximately 80% of the film is built with a centerpiece of the frame and everything behind that person or object in the setting is symmetrically detailed. The mechanical brilliance of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is assembled by Anderson's tumultuous approach.The plot does not hesitate to run on its ridiculous occurrences, which is why the film is able to pliably undergo Anderson's robotic editing style effectively. The score wonderfully adds to the uniqueness of the images on screen and is what captures most of the comedic moments, such as the blueprint-planned prison escape.The production values live up to the majestic bar set by Anderson's previously released films, such as the costumes, which are construed with bursting pigments and cinematography that captures hues of light that skillfully flicker the magic of the scenes.The massive impact of the film does not end with visual decadence. The lofty cast is a collection of some of Hollywood's most prolific actors including F. Murray Abrahams, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Saoirse Roan, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and most importantly Ralph Fiennes. The miracle of so many actors signing on for limited roles is impressive enough, but to synchronize such varying talents into a single spirit is a delight to watch. Fiennes does most of the heavy lifting as M. Gustave, forthrightly witty, but humorously proper.The one place Anderson does not completely rival the aspects from past films is the personable attachment to the characters like what he achieved in ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Here, his focus is redirected to the method of telling a story, rather than character exploration, which is forgivable. He plays with motifs and overarching plot devices instead of building layered characters. The infamous ""Boy with Apple"" painting acts as a somewhat macguffin for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" a priceless painting bequeathed to Ralph Fiennes' M. Gustave by Tilda Swinton's cameo role of Madame D., which stays locked in a safe for acts two and three, but dictates most of the action in film. A sense was in the air that Anderson was possibly using the painting as a parallel to the film itself: an artistic marvel that is not fully realized until the story is complete. Another self-referential symbol of the pungent film is in the sugary, perfectly bundled Mendel pastry cakes.Modulated with the expected stylish chapter/title cards and the amusing eccentric dialogue, Wes Anderson has assembled what is sure to be one of 2014's most genial illustrations. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" wins over the audience with the fastidious direction, the symmetric set design, Fiennes's comically deferential, deliciously blunt performance, and the accessibility derived from being immune from an overdose to Anderson's usual method.Grade: B+Rating: 7.6"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 October 2021,7/10,"Picturesque images, unnatural composition, surreal expression of realistic plot, comedy wrapping solemn subject. 'The Grand Budapest' gives such a joy to audience and provides many treasures to uncover such as music, set design, and styling. However, the plot is too unorganized. I understand that quirkiness and structure cannot go hand in hand, but too many narratives are thrown sporadically without progress. The quality of plot development cannot catch up with that of cinematography."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 October 2015,8/10,"You get about 5 seconds thorough a Wes Anderson movie and straight away you just know it's that sly guy with his unique style. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Andersons little project here and one that is hugely entertaining as well, mixing humour with wit and love with surrealism, this movie truly contains a lot of different things. The story is about Gustave H a hotel manager of the place in the title, but it is not through his eyes we see the story no, it is F. Murray Abraham well no it is the character of Zero Moustafa a small hotel concierge who is hired by Gustave and quickly rises up to be a star player in the running of the hotel. The plot throws in twists and turns, characters that only Anderson could make up and at one point a shoot-out between a group of people who have no idea who they are shooting(sounds pretty mixed up right). The one thing that stops this being pretentious or anything along those lines is that it is funny, thoughtful but also just generally made up well, it never tries to make you think ""Oh cool"" but you can at times feel that, but it doesn't feel forced.The movie contains so many actors it is near impossible to count how many big names or recognisable faces this movie contains. Gustave is played by an very on form Ralph Fiennes whose performance is both hilarious but also just generally well acted even dramatically speaking. We see the likes of Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Jude Law, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray and even one of Anderson's absolute favourites, Jason Schwartzman. The strange thing is that among all the talent on show it is the young actor who portrays Zero who is maybe one of the most memorable and his name is Tony Revolori. Now I am not saying Revolori is that great I mean it really is Fiennes who steals the show acting wise, but Revolori does enough to make his character stick out and you can sort of in ways connect to him. Straight from the side camera shots are just one of the many things we see so often in Wes Anderson's plethora of work. In this movie he adds in little miniature set pieces with little trees and buildings and also moving miniature figures and vehicles and really makes them look actually good and uses them to good effect too. The movie likes to move fast I mean after all it is fairly short, however the frantic pace does not make this any less of a great piece in fact if anything it makes the jokes funnier because they are so quick and snappy, at times the slight humour can drip out but in large quantities so it feels pretty nicely done. What Anderson also does so well is just make this feel so fresh and new, I mean to be fair who the hell as ever made a movie like this before but what Anderson brings to the table is more than fresh, it is fresh and really good mixing great characters who are likable with really nice sets and Wes writes the thing well too, I mean I can definitely see why this got so many nominations at ceremonies across the world. Is there much wrong? ,well I guess it could have been the slightest bit more laugh out loud at times but that doesn't matter, that isn't what this movie is all about. I think this is a sort of lovable movie but for sure is extremely likable and I don't think only a certain ""crowd"" will like it, it has a little something for all to offer. One more thing I really need to say which I never went properly into is the production design especially the whole make up of the sets used, the sets used for the parts in the 30's are magnificent and some of the best I have ever seen in movies, I felt yet again Anderson's style creeping up in even the smallest of places."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 April 2015,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy film directed by Wes Anderson. The screenplay by Anderson is from a story by Anderson and Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. It stars Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees (Tony Revolori) to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder.In the 1930s, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a popular European ski resort, presided over by concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Zero, a junior lobby boy, becomes Gustave's friend and protégé. Gustave prides himself on providing first-class service to the hotel's guests, including satisfying the sexual needs of the many elderly women who stay there. When one of Gustave's lovers dies mysteriously, Gustave finds himself the recipient of a priceless painting and the chief suspect in her murder."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 December 2018,9/10,"Where many films attempt to be endearing in a way that ends up being artificial, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is artificial in a way that is endearing. Wes Anderson doesn't try to pretend it's real and that allows him to make GBH as delightfully eccentric as can be. The aspect ratio is perfectly harnessed to make every shot one-of-a-kind. He has a way of framing every moment in the most perfect way, and this is often used for delightfully goofy humour. Playing into the artificiality, some of the shots appear to use models, such as shots of the hotel from far off and the brilliant ski chase.The characters are charming and funny but not one-note. Gustave and Zero are a great pair of protagonists. The way their friendship pans out fleshes both of them out. Gustave is not a simple character, his quirkiness hiding real depth. He is loyal and values loyalty, but this tends to be the case when he hopes to get something in return. His kindness to fellow prisoners for example is rewarded by allowing him to escape without calling the guards. Or does he genuinely want to please people without expecting anything in return? The way he takes Zero on despite him having zero qualifications surely shows that to be true. Zero himself is definitely not of zero worth, showing himself to be multifaceted. He puts loyalty to Gustave above everything else but he isn't defined by it, nor is he afraid to stand up to him openly. Over the course of the film it's impossible not to care about him and to feel sorry when tragedy strikes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 January 2019,6/10,I was expecting a little more from this film with a star studded cast. Overall a little disappointing
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 March 2014,9/10,"If one measure of a work of art is how thoroughly it creates its own world, then this movie is completely successful. It is funny, witty, charming. There isn't a dull frame or a wasted moment. In the spirit of the Mitteleuropa that it dusts down and recreates, like the wares of its fictional baker, it is exquisitely crafted and delicious. It is nostalgic whilst casting a shrewd light on nostalgia, and only superficially superficial.Whilst I'm sure Ralph Fiennes is very grateful for his career, it is nevertheless true that the role that brought him to Hollywood's attention, Amon Goeth in SCHINDLER'S LIST, set him off on an occasionally tedious course of broody psychopaths and intense romantics. Here he seizes his chance to prove himself an excellent light comedian, clearly enjoying this opportunity to gently mock his previous film personae. He is captivating. It's unlikely he'll get any formal recognition for this, as comedy fares badly at award ceremonies for some inexplicable reason.One of the film's great pleasures is watching a superb cast clearly having a great time. Cameos fly by, none more enjoyable than Bill Murray's. What extraordinary presence that man has on the screen! Among the other goodies are real gravitas from F. Murray Abraham, snarling malice from Adrien Brody, and finger-licking psychopathy from Wilem Dafoe. Praise too for Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan as the completely unsentimental but entirely necessary lovers.A real treat."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 December 2020,8/10,"Just when you think thrillers can't possibly get more inventive, leave it to Wes Anderson to prove us wrong. It is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the 2010s and features wonderful performances from the entire cast with Ralf Fiennes giving perhaps his greatest performance yet."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 May 2014,10/10,"2014 is yet to reach its half-way point but I think it's safe to say that we may have a winner already. Delightfully infectious, spontaneously funny and impeccably detailed, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of the year and perhaps director Wes Anderson's best film yet.Also co-written by Anderson, the story is a baroque-styled narration, and a story within a story about the once opulent Budapest Hotel – a pink mansion set atop ice capped ridges in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. Going from modern day to 1968, the narration begins when an unnamed author (Jude Law) meets the owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). The narration and perspective shifts to 1932, where the Grand Budapest is a luxurious hotel catering to the wealthy. Young Zero (Tony Revolori) has joined the hotel as the new bellboy and is taken under the wing of head concierge M Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustav has an OCD for perfectionism, with work ethics that include seducing his richest guests – usually blonde older women. Madame D is one such guest but her mysterious death sets about a series of events that turns Gustav's world inside-out while simultaneously making him a legend in the process.Packed with incident after zany incident, Gustav and Zero's adventures fill most of the running time with a script that never ceases to astonish. Anderson's penchant for style and escapism exists, but this time his typical melancholy is replaced with plenty of madcap humour that turns out to be more whimsical than slapstick. And that's a good thing because there's also quite a few startling scenes of violence. Speaking of which, the backdrop is pre WWII fascism and despite the film's many comical shenanigans, the inner musings on war and tragedy runs deep, even if these are masked with the film's more recognisable outer façade of a whodunit murder mystery.From costumes and makeup to the intricate crafting of its period backdrop, The Grand Budapest Hotel scores top marks as a multi-faceted and exquisitely fashioned set piece. Starting with the impressive cinematography, every frame in every scene is a picture perfect postcard. Another standout is the fantastic list of cameos, some of which are easily identifiable from Anderson's previous films. From bad guys played by Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe to an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, this has to be one of the biggest ensembles since Anderson's very own The Royal Tenenbaums. Finally, Anderson's greatest nuance in this film is the creation of a lovable yet equally perverse Gustav. Not only has Fiennes ventured beyond his comfort zone, his Gustav commands your attention like no other character in Anderson's eccentric universe. The Grand Budapest Hotel is highly recommended as a thoroughly enjoyable dramedy that is in pole position as one of the best films of the year. Once you check in you won't want to check out!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 August 2021,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has nothing new in it, it is same flashback story telling about a crime adventure. What makes this movie different is that it was executed in a different way. These type of stories don't have impact on audience that much but the execution of this movie made this movie to have impact on tue audience.Almost everything in this movie; direction, acting, pace setting, tone built-up was good. The interaction scenes between two main leads were grasping. The pace and tone setting was also good. Everything in the movie looked real, not forceful. Only thing which I didn't like about this movie was that last hour was very much uneven and was little bit unbalanced.Overall, you must give it a try. You will enjoy this different adventure which comprises of crime and drama."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 September 2014,9/10,"You know you've made your mark in the cinematic world when just a few visual images from a trailer reveals that you are behind the movie. Whether it's the rapid-fire editing of Tony Scott (or his successor, Edgar Wright), pulp house content of Robert Rodriguez (who just isn't the same anymore), or the long-sweeping shots of Steven Spielberg, if you can immediately figure out who made the movie with just an image or a scene alone, it's a very, very good sign.And now we have Wes Anderson and his whimsical, colorful, adult Dr. Seuss style of storytelling that has potentially reached its peak with the enduring, zany, and unpredictable Grand Budapest Hotel. This cinematic ball of energy looks like a Pollock painting if it ever got organized, runs like a Looney Tunes cartoon, and delivers an adult story in a most unique, childlike wondrous way. Similar to how Woody Allen's career took a second wind as he went overseas, Wes Anderson's movie-making trip to Europe elevates his skills and abilities as a director to brand new heights.The story is surprisingly dark, as it spans multiple World Wars and covers a mystery involving a woman that may or may not have been murdered. The plot however moves so swiftly, so quickly, and contains so many humorous twists and turns you don't have time to dwell on the grimness. It does help that we have an excellent cast playfully tagging along for the ride, including Ralph Fieness in an Oscar-worthy performance, William Dafoe, and Tony Revolori---while also giving points to Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrian Brody, and Jeff Goldblum for their small but memorable roles.Cast is important (Wes always has great casts, Hollywood should take notes), but this is Anderson's work first and foremost, and it's his writing and meticulous attention to detail that has allowed for him to emerge as one of the top directors in the game. Too bad that his light indie style doesn't exactly fit with the norm that usually gets Oscar attention (Similar to Spike Jonze). Don't let the lack of Oscar bait bum you though, the movie is dazzling eye candy with gorgeous shots and even more gorgeous cinematography that warrants multiple viewings to appreciate the backgrounds and foregrounds that blend with the cast and the story being told. The unconventionalism (not a word, I know) of Anderson separates him from not only Hollywood but from the Indie movement as well.Grand Budapest Hotel is a Wes film plain and simple: great plot, colorful cast of characters, detailed settings, bite-sized dark humor, quirky swirl of comedy and drama, and an energy that you just don't get in many works nowadays. Grand Budapest Hotel is a visual treat from start to finish, so if you can handle his unique flavor and brand, then there is no reason why you would skip this movie. Easily one of the best you'll see this year."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2015,6/10,"Don't get me wrong, this is a funny-ish, quirky, alright little movie. But it is just that. Alright.How many Oscar nominations did it get? About a billion. While I watched it, never, not for a second, did Oscar come to mind. Although, the Oscars is but a bleak shadow of what it used to be. Moving on. (I did not know about the nominations when I saw it, just for the record)This movie is quirky. Kind of strange, got some humor of the Wes Anderson-type, it's got a lot of strange characters, and an OK plot. But never is it really fantastic. I think people just expect Wes Anderson to be brilliant, and so they think everything he does is.As I said, it's mostly entertaining. But it never becomes much more than OK. It has a lot of actors, pretty big names, which is part of the reason why I wanted to see it. But to be honest I expected more from the movie it self. Yeah, it's visually interesting, but everyone already knows that."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 June 2020,9/10,"This is not just a movie, it is a game, a fairy tale, or a piece of art, which perfectly combines the author's aesthetic style, form and nostalgic theme! Regardless of the story, play, theme and aesthetics, its recognition is only for yourself. For fans of Wes Anderson, this is a masterpiece!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,6/10,"I'm one of about three people in the world who reckon The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is Wes Anderson's best film, although 2012's Moonrise Kingdom was a return to form after the slightly drab Darjeeling Limited and the mixed bag that was Fantastic Mr Fox.All of Anderson's films are mixed bags of confectionery. As he moves further from the relatively terrestrial charms of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, the results are becoming more alien, and arguably less relatable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is beautiful, charming, and meticulous, but as icily cold as an Eastern European winter. The best Anderson films have a central relationship that provides a warm heart amidst the whimsy. Moonrise had first love. Aquatic had father and son. Budapest has hotelier and protégé, but I never got a sense of intimacy between them, only ego and awe respectively.The hotelier is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and the protégé is Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). When Gustave's dear friend and lover Madame D (Tilda Swinton) drops dead, distant relatives and vague friends convene (the first of many cameo-tastic scenes), hoping to get a chunk of the deceased's wealth. Gustave is bequeathed a hugely valuable painting, much to the chagrin of the gathered mourners - particularly Madame D's son, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Adrien Brody), who begins a campaign to imprison and ultimately destroy Gustave, triggering all manner of breakouts, shootouts, and bumbling chases.If you've seen the trailer you'll be aware of the presence of the usual Anderson troupe, although it almost seems like overkill this time around, with famous faces merely popping up for the sake of a chuckle of recognition.The action (and ample talking) takes place largely outside the hotel, in cells and trains and leering post-Soviet streets. As a summoning of a time and place, it's Anderson's greatest achievement yet. The use of miniatures is very effective, reminiscent of the model work in Herbert Ponting's 1924 documentary The Great White Silence. There are also references to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, not just in Anderson's camera arranging characters in medium shot, and sliding through bold-coloured corridors along geometrically precise lines, but also in the theme of the passing of time: the way generations feed into each other through stories of intrigue and murder passed down.This is a melancholy film, made darker by its greedy scheming characters, and as such it feels unusually at odds with its own madcap, absurdist style. Unfortunately (and surprisingly), f-bombs constitute much of the humour; hearing Fiennes curse coarsely is funny the first couple of times, but it becomes tiresome. The scenes between The Author (Jude Law) and older Zero (F. Murray Abraham) work best, showing us the more settled, subtle, sombre film that might have been, and possibly the future of this uniquely talented auteur - but they are also indicative of the film's lack of tonal coherency."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 October 2015,5/10,"As a non-fan of Wes Anderson, this is easily his most accessible and/or enjoyable film to date. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it's a fun film (something I can't say about the rest of his movies).Although I don't like his technique of cinematography - static or dolly camera, always symmetric and in straight angles or quick pan/tilt - it's rather OK in this film (but still very distracting). Same goes for the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (and other numerous aspect ratios and framings during the beginning of the movie).There are so many guest appearances by great actors, that it makes the movie even more fun to watch.Good production design and film locations, pretty quick pacing (after a slow start) and fun movie to watch.The makeup on Tilda Swinton is fantastic."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 March 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson divides opinion. Of that there can be no debate.This movie will divide opinion. Of that there is no doubt.But it is a work of very great merit because it takes the medium and turns it upside down. This movie melds slapstick with performance art, melodrama with interior design, comedy with tragedy and it makes Ralph Feinnes a little bit godlike (something I never thought I'd never catch myself saying). Feinnes' central performance in this movie is mesmerising. Half terribly polite, terribly gay aristocrat, half rampantly heterosexual (having bedded half the female population of the fictitious Zubrowka, a European alpine state). He swears like a trooper, in the most inappropriate way in an ever so pukka accent that just doesn't seem right.He leads us through the proceedings with such dexterity that you cannot possibly guess what is coming next, aided throughout by his sidekick - the 17 year old Lobby Boy Zero Mustapha played by Tony Revolori (he looks about 10, perhaps exacerbated by his hilarious hand drawn moustache). The movie is mainly shot in flashback as the older Zero Mustapha (H. Murray Abraham) recalls the tale of how he came to own what was once a grand edifice but is now entirely run down and frequented by a bunch of random loners.The tale is, of course, ridiculous and involves murder, robbery, disputed wills and the most outrageous jail break you will ever see in your life.The flashback element is framed in a perfect square - a screen shape not seen since the silent era (it's not even 4:3 aspect ratio it's 4:4. Although it's described as 1:37 on IMDb - not so). Frame after frame brings delight. The attention to detail in propping, in background asides, in costume and in the comic use of animation or manipulated film speed (the sledge scene is a hoot) adds layer upon layer and makes the movie a must see again to pick out what you missed the first time.The cast list is too long to list here but I counted 13 bona fide A listers. Spot them if you can as some of them aren't on screen long (an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton, for example, departs after about 5 minutes).Repeatedly Anderson uses repetition in his script and it's laugh out loud funny every time.How good was it? Well, put it this way, I ain't ever seen an audience burst into almost universal spontaneous applause on a rainy Tuesday night outside of a film festival.That's how good it is."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 September 2014,7/10,"Effortlessly entertaining and aggressively likable, the movie has many elements that deserve high praise. Firstly and most importantly the visual coherence and beauty of this movie was flawless. I was constantly looking at the screen trying to take it all in, there's just nothing, not even the most tiny little thing, wrong with the aesthetic aspect. Production design and cinematography complete each other and add up to a simply delicious framing, that is explicitly reflected by the wonderful looking cakes in the story. I wasn't always thrilled with the tension scenes, but there is one in particular in the mountains that was extraordinarily magical: shot is such a stylish, thrilling and original way I was genuinely on the edge of my seat. I really can't speak enough of the visual aspect of this movie. Just as good is the acting here, especially Ralph Finnes' performance, delicate and artificial, yet the standouts are everywhere and there were some truly hilarious characters, watch out for Wiliem Defoes' performance. All in all this was a technically brilliant and stylish movie, but I just think that it fell short of something more because of a slight emotional detachment from the story. I have to admit that the central drama of the film, although fairly entertaining, isn't just as fascinating as the initial scenes in the Hotel. What is missing here is the genuine emotion and sentiment of a ""Moonrise Kingdom"", not to say that you aren't involved in the turn-out of events, yet I was always feeling the weight of the movie in my head, something that didn't happen with Anderson's previous film and unfortunately with the exception of some iconic scenes the movie is quite forgettable. This speaks to the missing deep sentimental element of the movie that made Moonrise Kingdom so unforgettable. Despite this lack I still had a great time and was actually surprised by some turns the movie made both in the story both in the style."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 March 2015,8/10,"Drenched in literary awesomeness, Wes Anderson's beautiful adventurous tale is about the life of a concierge named Gustave, who develops a friendship with a loyal Lobby Boy Zero Moustafa, a young immigrant from the East, an account of a misfortune that fires up an avalanche of events. Set in a span between the World Wars, the story is basically a narration from a writer, who had met a hollow version of Zero in The Grand Budapest Hotel, who in turn narrates every account of his and Gustave's adventure to him. (Talk about Inception eh!)Screenplay is just marvellous. It touches bits of humour quite subtly. The direction is top notch just the way Wes likes to depict his cinema. If you have seen his previous works you would know how brilliantly he projects his frames and takes you to a different world altogether. You couldn't help but marvel at the way he rotates his camera and runs into inanimate things for focus. He leaves most of the action part to our vivid imagination. Built backdrops and landscapes in the flick are quite artistic and perfectly manifested with a unique animation.Wes carves his writing gorgeously, as occasionally he slips into splendid poetic verses beautifully enunciated by Ralph Fiennes. The story runs great along with some exceptional editing. A gripping adventure that breathes on outstanding performances by Fiennes, Norton, Dafoe, Brody, Goldblum and Revolori. Even though it had a stellar cast, actors like Bill Murray, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman basically had cameos.The Grand Budapest Hotel is simply a glimpse into the creative head of Wes Anderson. It is a remarkable feat in comedy and direction and a must watch for people who love quality cinema."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2020,7/10,"It's a long movie, even if it lasts less than 2 hours. That's the short review. But seriously, it's a fast-paced film that got tedious because of the excessive amount of, mostly rhetorical, speech. I know the movie is a narrative, but it does get boring after a while. The plot is full of turnovers and twists. With many big names on it, the cast, make the movie worth being watched once and, sometimes, makes us laugh. The art direction and production were a case apart, it was great."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 March 2014,8/10,"Over the last twenty years, writer-director-auteur Wes Anderson has built something quite odd in Hollywood. We don't just mean his deeply unique music-box films, which are themselves ornate, unusual and thoroughly offbeat by commercial standards. Rather, it's the repertory company he's established within the confines of the Hollywood system: a revolving troupe of actors who are more than happy to keep returning to help him achieve his singular vision in film after quirky film. He's reached his zenith with The Grand Budapest Hotel, an unmistakably Andersonian re-imagination of old-world Europe - with all its romanticised cultural mores and traditions - on the cusp of a devastating war.In the late 1960s, an Author (played by Tom Wilkinson in the present and Jude Law in the past) visits the fading Grand Budapest Hotel - an establishment gone completely to seed, with a limited rota of guests. There, he meets Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the Hotel's eccentric owner, and is regaled by tales of the Hotel's glory days. As a young, impressionable lobby boy (Tony Revolori), Zero becomes the apprentice of the legendary M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), a flamboyantly devoted concierge of the old school whose involvement with his elderly, female clientele - specifically Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) - will soon kick off an adventure of epic proportions. Mixed in with a disputed will, a stolen painting, a jailbreak and an encroaching military presence is a healthy nostalgia for a world that, perhaps, never really existed at all.Anderson's critics have long complained of the deliberate archness of his stories and characters - they're so meticulously constructed and so resolutely strange that it's hard to connect with them on any kind of true emotional level. Ironically, it's only his stop-motion animation feature, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, that managed to elude such criticisms, largely because the family of foxes at the heart of the tale were so recognisably human.He again performs a quiet magic of that order with The Grand Budapest Hotel, a sugar-light confection on the surface, but one with a darker, more historically grounded undertow. Much of the film unfolds in the key of a carnival: zippy, fresh and chirpy. But within his fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka, Anderson conjures up the chilling spectre of Nazism - even if the swastika has been replaced with a pair of lightning bolts and the officers are given a more human face in the form of Inspector Henckels (Edward Norton).As a result, the film hits upon quite a few bittersweet grace notes, emotional connections that are often lost in the tumult of oddities that make up a typical Anderson film. Here, the larger-than-life Gustave isn't merely a bundle of quirks and tics: scratch beneath his fey, heavily-perfumed exterior, and you'll find a man with a heart full of honour and humour. He may be, strictly speaking, a gigolo profiting from the loneliness of elderly ladies, but he genuinely believes that he's giving them the courtly companionship and love they all deserve. The relationship between Gustave and Zero is also wonderfully crafted: an unusual father-son bond forged amidst their hijinks and capers.The cast of The Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, delightful. Fiennes, a brand new addition to Anderson's troupe, delivers the funniest, warmest performance of his dignified career, demonstrating a comic flair so sharp that it practically slices its way off the screen. Revolori makes a charming cinematic debut as the poker-faced Zero, striking up a sweet chemistry with Saoirse Ronan, who plays his brave and bold love interest Agatha. The rest of Anderson's repertory company gleefully pop up throughout the film: Adrien Brody as Madame D's villainous son; Willem Dafoe as his ominous henchman; Jason Schwartzman as Gustave's incompetent successor, a generation or two down the line - to name but a few.As is now par for the course in an Anderson film, the production design on The Grand Budapest Hotel is outstanding and incredibly inventive. With his trademark hand-crafted visual effects (hotels and funiculars rendered in model form), Anderson lends a quaint, creaky charm to the entire film. It would be easy to get completely distracted by his snow- washed vision of a bygone era, if not for the fact that his characters - who plummet down ski slopes or dash across moonlit rooftops - are such fun to be around.It's easy to complain about some of the film's failings, most of which are characteristic of Anderson's entire oeuvre anyway. It's so decidedly odd that it's sometimes hard to view it as anything but a curio. At points, the film drags a little, quite unable to maintain a consistently swift, sure rhythm. But those are minor points in what feels like quite a major work. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson at his most assured and accessible: it's a film that compromises none of its creator's unique movie-making ideas and values and, in fact, goes quite a long way in communicating them to a far wider audience."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 March 2020,8/10,"I've seen random pictures from this movie and I always thought, wtf is that? It's been on my watch list for a while and today I finally decided to watch it, This first 30 minutes of this film I was both in awe, and laughing my guts out. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, I found it surprisingly funny and compelling. While I do feel the story falls apart a bit, I still found this movie a lot of fun. Watch it if you're into other Wes Anderson films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 November 2014,9/10,"This shaggy-dachshund story from Wes Anderson, set in a fictional mountain realm between the World Wars, has a lot going for it, even though it lacks the emotional resonance of Anderson's near-perfect ""Moonrise Kingdom."" I doubt that anyone was eagerly awaiting this obsessive re-creation of the lost world of the Austro-Hungarian empire, as mirrored in the works of Stefan Zweig (who gets a writing credit), but here it is, all the same.The caper plot involving a fussy hotel concierge turned action hero and his wide- eyed sidekick is a total hoot; all the Anderson trademarks are on display-the exquisite dollhouse sets and gorgeous cinematography, the jokey little signs (the local newspaper is ""The Transalpine Yodel"") and sly sight gags (a prison guard probes food parcels with a bayonet, doesn't have the heart to impale a bag of delicate pastries).Ralph Fiennes as ""the legendary concierge M. Gustave"" carries the movie, supported by the usual Anderson familiars plus cameos by the likes of Saoirse Ronan and Léa Seydoux; especially good work by Willem Dafoe as a lycanthropic hit-man. It's an impressive achievement, within its self-imposed limitations, but it's surprising that, with so much attention paid to the technical side of things, the script seems a little slack at times (didn't anybody who read it know the difference between ""vouched for"" and ""vouchsafed""?), and I'm not sure that an emo guy like Zweig, author of ""Letter from an Unknown Woman,"" would have liked to be remembered for such a bloodless and contrived cinematic pastiche."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 January 2018,8/10,"I'm not sure I can say much more about Wes Anderson that hasn't already been said - he's definitely one of the most singular filmmakers of our generation. Needless to say, if you liked 'The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou', 'The Darjeeling Limited' and 'Moonrise Kingdom' (which I did), then you'll enjoy 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. It's got a huge ensemble cast, but the usual faces (Murray, Schwartzman, Norton, Wilson) are only given bit parts, with Gustave (Fiennes) the undisputed central character here.Even though it's named after the hotel, only about half the film takes place there - and when it does, it looks fantastic, with the colour and framing. They do a great job of telling the film as a back story, allowing Zero (Revolori/Abraham) to be our eyes and ears into the hotel's - and Gustave's - past. It's a fascinating story, with plenty of laughs, but also a decent murder-mystery/chase film packed in there. This is aided immensely by Adrien Brody & Willem Dafoe playing the ""badguys"".Everything flows nicely, there's precise dialogue (as always), a great score and great set/costume design. Goldblum's great as the lawyer and used really effectively. I can't really say much more - it's a really well-made and enjoyable film!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2020,8/10,"Watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is like pushing a layer of secret doors into a parallel world of real history carefully driven by memories of emotions. Through the vocabulary of this world, we see the thrilling resistance and self-struggle of the weak human civilization under the ""barbarous slaughterhouse"".
Narrative structure
""Symmetry"" aesthetics not only appears in the composition, but also uses a loop-lock structure in the narrative. Tombstones, young writers, conversations between young writers and old Zero, and Zero's memories are repeated in reverse after the memories are over, like piling up precious gifts layer by layer. After attracting people into the play, the spirit that naturally throws people in the world of illusion is guided away. The subtle realization of the ""purification"" effect of Aristotle's ""tragedy"" gives people an excellent and satisfying impression.
Narrative rhythm and audiovisual language
The unique narrative rhythm of the film and audio-visual skills jointly build this independent world. The ubiquitous sense of rhythm creates an unexpected comedy effect, and the serious theme and a serious line of content constitute drama irony. The actions and expressions of the characters, like stop motion animation, enter fast-forward mode when in motion, but also play an extremely prominent and accentuating role when at rest; if the former brings overall ease and humor, then the latter creates a stream of water The rugged rocky reef lurked in the fortress, and was hit at the climax.
Abnormal colors such as pink and the overall dream-like toning atmosphere are spread in the guiding composition; the music is relaxed and eager and has a certain era style. These three are unified in the creative impulse and personal style of the director under the strong emotion of recollecting that particular historical period, which maximizes the illusion of the general 's film and counteracts the reality of setting the world. . For example, Mr. Gustav took a deep breath and leaned slightly after a close-up lens with a side face. The rhythmic and psychedelic music sounded, and the main character walked through the screen with the same rhythm. . This means that Mr. Gustav enters his service role, and also means that the audience enters the specific world constructed by the director.
create character
An important pillar supporting the unique stylized presentation of this film is the symbolization of characters. The placement of the nickname ""Killer"", Zero's ""doorman"" identity throughout, and Mr. Gustav is the embodiment of the classical European noble culture. Behind the story of the encounter between Mr. Gustav and Ozawa Roze, it shows the survival and reaction of a certain spiritual form in a certain environment-a bit similar to the ""scenario"" concept proposed by Mr. Sartre. ""The world maintained by Gustav has long since passed away. He relies on strong personal charm to maintain this illusion as much as possible"" is the most obvious expression. The film constructs the character itself through the various reactions and habits of the characters in the whole story, and let him die together with the story.
Stepping out of the story and looking back at the Budapest Hotel, which has become synonymous with depression, loneliness, and perseverance, the last curtain of the classical aristocratic culture came to an end."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 August 2021,8/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" sets itself apart from reality cinema and enchants with an exuberant adventure inspired by early twentieth-century novels. It's a film that allows imagination to run wild without any intention to create the illusion of reality. Visually, it's like flipping through a popup book. I loved how everything is quirky and colorful, yet so refined and sophisticated, with so many little details in each frame to add value to the storytelling. The narration is a bit too fragmented at times, but the fast pacing and sharp script help keep the film fresh and amusing throughout. It's Wes Anderson to the extreme, and a film that does not want to be taken seriously."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,6/10,"As someone who usually can't sit through a Wes Anderson film without the urge to gouge my eyes out, this was a surprisingly painless experience. Sure, his obnoxious camera work and aristocratic narrative nonsense is in full swing here, but Anderson keeps this yarn relatively straightforward and avoids his usual quirky non sequiturs. The art direction is gorgeous to look at and this story book film works because of the structure of the yarn. The teller of the tale is F. Murray Abraham, who gives a nice performance, but this is a Wes Anderson film after all, so while there are a few moments of honesty, this is mostly a madcap farce filled to the brim with broad characters. It's all surface, style, lightweight stuff and doesn't have a millimeter of depth, but this over directed film is Anderson's most entertaining film in quite some time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 January 2015,7/10,"Another drolly twee film from Wes Anderson, better than some of his previous work (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", ""Rushmore"") but not nearly as good as others (""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox""). Here, he assembles a mighty cast, with Ralph Fiennes starring as the fastidious and ambiguous manager of a distant eastern European hotel (located in the fictitious Republic of Zubrowka; the action takes place between world wars), whose care of his guests extends beyond the usual service and who gets involved with the nefarious family of one of his elderly lovers, led by son Adrian Brody (who, by wearing pseudo-Nazi clothing, unthinkably undermines his most famous role, the persecuted Jew of ""The Pianist""). This being Anderson, it's all about cadence: he expends an awful lot of energy synchronizing his actors' responses and the rhythms of the music (a winning score by Alexandre Desplat). But really, that's all it's about--the film is completely inconsequential nonsense. Sure, it's entertaining while you're watching it but you're completely aware that what you're watching has no real substance. All the performers competently perform to Anderson's stylized, obsessive/compulsive standards but the true stars of the film are Adam Stockhausen's gorgeous production design, Anna Pinnock's intricate set decoration and the fun art direction, led by Stephan O. Gessler: it's easy to get lost in the dazzling visuals, especially when there's no real need to pay attention to what's going on in the forefront. Conceivably, it may even be better with no sound--certainly, the overall design recalls the era of silent film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2015,10/10,"I decided to watch the film since many of my friends were really into this film.And what a joy it is ! I don't know for the others, but almost the whole film I had a smile on my face. It is strange that a film can make me smile or maybe to say make me happy while watching it! But this one did this!The story is weird but beautiful, as it is the hotel and everything around it. It is very 'arty' film for me and I liked it because of that! The acting of everyone was really great! I think the choice for two main roles was superb!10 from me!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,8/10,"21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worth watching."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 May 2014,8/10,"Form a the point of view of structure, the movie is a sample of perfect accomplishment, there isn't a single flaw in the construction of the plot, as if the it were geometrically conceived. The world represented is full of grotesque, eccentric, unnatural situations, all strongly tied up by an intriguing and fast-paced story, with plot twists, surreal expedients, ironic and funny moments, without ever losing a strong control over the abundant material.This fantastic and yet real world is peopled by grotesque and bizarre characters, very well interpreted by a topnotch cast, everyone does a very good job, also supported by a strong and confident direction, which leaves nothing to improvisation.A very imaginary and refined work of art, where however the act of imagination and the unreal represented world are not for art's sake, but leave also much to think about the real world, a real contemporary Europe still victim of a tragic past and never resolved racial conflicts."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 June 2020,10/10,"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.-- Charlie ChaplinAs a comedy film ""Budapest Hotel (The Grand Budapest Hotel)"", appears to be a quirky comedy world, but it is filled with a little sad, of course, there is no denying The fact that The film viewing process is pleasant and smooth, but always have a lingering falls lingering in my mind, can be said to be The nostalgia for bygone era, also can saying is The humanistic spirit of festivals, also can be said to be The good feeling for The volatile, when there is ""inspired by zweig"" until The end, finally clear The sad reason.
In the film, Gustav, the former lobby manager of the Grand Budapest Hotel, says: ""In the barbaric slaughterhouse, there are glimmers of civilization. That is human nature.""

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2015,8/10,"You have to hand it to Wes Anderson. He certainly has his own style of film. The Grand Budapest is a screwball hybrid of action, adventure, comedy, romance and just about everything else. And after all of those elements are thrown together, its one hell of a film.It might just be the most beautiful film I've ever looked at. The production design, costumes and hair and makeup meld together to create a magical setting that I not only believed in, I wanted to be there. From the violet jacket and neat moustache of Gustave H. to the rainbow of jackets of the Society of the Crossed Keys, from Tilda Swinton's aged makeup to the glorious set design of the Hotel itself, Anderson's film is a feast for the eyes.Ralph Fiennes is without a doubt one of the most unappreciated actors in existence. This performance of his might just be one of his best. His comedic timing is so flawless, his delivery perfect and his demeanour so utterly charming, this is as much his vehicle as Anderson's. He takes traits that Adam Sandler made revolting the most endearing qualities possible, and Anderson's words roll off his tongue with ease and grace. And he is wickedly, wonderfully funny. Young Tony Revolori is the perfect foil for Fiennes, they have wonderful back-and-forth, he is sympathetic and endearing all of his own right. I hope this movie is a big breakthrough for him. As for the rest of the cast, it looks like a list of presenters at the Academy Awards, so they're all obviously talented even if many of them feel underused at times. The fact that none of them stand out says a fair bit.Wes Anderson's screenplay is another huge reason for success. The film wouldn't be able to boast the beautiful visuals or glorious performances. His writing captures Gustave H's glorious mannerisms, the film's eventful adventures and most of all, the beautiful setting of the story. The dialogue in itself is completely delightful, and even the four-tier story setting feels an integral part of the film's feeling, as it allows for F. Murray Abraham and Jude Law to narrate and keep the film's flow.Anderson's screenplay has a major hole at the film's conclusion, where all charges are dropped for no reason, Gustave is exonerated instead of being treated with more suspicion, Madame D.'s killer is never revealed, and Dmitri leaves instead of arcing up even more. One person said to me ""oh I don't care about things like that"" when I first mentioned it, and I have carried incredulity ever since. How is the resolution of the entire plot unimportant? Also grating on me are certain accents - some are blatantly American whereas others are distinctly European. But the film is just so charming, its just so charming. I'm glad the visual feast was recognised at the Oscars, even though Anderson and Fiennes were not. Its funny, somber and utterly delightful, watchable on any occasion."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2014,9/10,"Colourful, shocking (in more ways than you would think but not gratuitously), amusing, entertaining, beautiful, thoughtful, inspiring - what more could you want from a movie? This film has all these features and more. It really is a tour de force of great story telling, incredible production values, superb acting and finely tuned directing. Tilda Swinton is absolutely fabulous as the grand Dame whose demise causes all the drama to unfold. Action packed, 'mythical' and grimly realistic in equal measure this sure is a 'fairy tale' for modern times. It's worth seeing once, twice and many more times there is so much to take in. A classic."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2015,9/10,"This film is perfect for a Friday night laugh. Its comedic element is at times so random but so funny that you can't help but just laugh out loud. It is silly without being overly stupid and it still manages to keep the story going. There are quite a few plots in this as the events just keep coming and the ball keeps rolling.The acting is phenomenal. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori make an unusual pairing but the chemistry between them and their conversations with each other is flawless. They portray their characters incredibly well as did Edward Norton and Saoirse Ronan. Adrien Brody did an all right job, though he seemed a bit over the top or maybe I'm just not used to seeing him in this sort of character. He was still pretty funny. Willem Dafoe's stone face is a weird mix between comedy and thriller.One thing I noticed is that apart from one or two characters, the whole film consists of mainly stock characters. I'm referring to characters who are only one dimensional and only show one side of themselves. I don't know if this is genius but to pull off a film and have it succeed without any character development is amazing. However, because the character's all have a place and fit so well with/ against each other, it works to its advantage. Though these characters are not complicated, it must have took a lot of planning to come up with them and arrange their relationships with each other.The cinematography is great and the artificial colouring adds to its comedic effect. Because it is so obviously fake sometimes, it just adds to the mood. Even the poster and images of the hotel seem to be two-dimensional, like a setting for a play or puppet show. Which is why I found it a little disconcerting when dark elements were introduced in this film (deaths and so on), it was too gruesome an aspect next to this comedic set up.I also did enjoy the screenplay, Gustave is such a very charismatic character and Fiennes plays him so perfectly. The way that the conversations go so fast makes the audience stay focused on what is happening and it doesn't give a moment's rest. The unnecessary swearing, I admit was funny, but luckily there wasn't too much of that.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2014,9/10,"I haven't really seen much of his other works (except Fantastic Mister Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums that I can't remember) so I can't judge this film compared to his previous ones. I can however judge that I had a grand old time watching Grand Budapest Hotel at the theatre. Stylistically, it was a triumph. It seemed almost every frame was filmed at right angles (90 degrees) - either facing the camera, left profile, right profile, back or from the top - with a few exceptions. I personally don't like when actors talk directly to the camera as so often happens here, but I didn't mind it this time. It even created a weird sense of intimacy. There was also a noticeable amount of rectangles and squares in the meticulously constructed frames with very little camera movement in those frames. It was like a succession of tableaux and, for lack of better expression, geometrically inspired and fascinating. The use of the bright colors, how they matched, was also stupendous, making for gorgeous scenes.So, it is a joy to look at from an artistic and technical point of view, but how about the story and the characters? It takes place in a fictional eastern-European country, probably inspired by Germany, and is mostly a very long flashback. The story revolves around Mr. Gustave, the eccentric but very competent concierge of a luxurious hotel, read general manager, and Zero, a lobby boy of foreign origin. Without going into details, a favoured customer dies, Gustave inherits something important that causes him tons of trouble. Contrary to what one might think, most of the film doesn't take place in the Grand Budapest Hotel. I usually don't like flashbacks, but I enjoyed very much how the outrageous, sometimes ridiculous story was told, even with the narration. However, the plot was mostly a backdrop to introduce a plethora of fun, colorful characters played by very famous actors clearly relishing their roles. Some were played deadly serious, others a little over the top, but what a great cast and very enjoyable acting. Of particular note were Ralph Fiennes playing the distinguished and multi-faceted Gustav, Jeff Goldblum playing an honest, very articulate lawyer, and Wilhem Dafoe as a criminal goon, but your favorites might vary. For me, the newcomer playing the lobby boy seemed a bit out of his depth acting-wise, but he was not too distracting and even good sometimes.The movie has a nostalgic feel to it and was quite funny despite being bittersweet. It has a strong energy and was never boring despite lots of mostly talking scenes. I found it particularly amusing whenever Gustave lost control of his distinguished manners and language. Most of the humor came from the clever writing, a few visual gags, and some ridiculous situations. Some might be put off by the obviously fake nature of certain decors and things (scale models), but I think it's probably a trademark of the director and I found those charming. Grand Budapest Hotel was a delight to experience and I would definitely visit it again.Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (remarquable)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,7/10,"So, I have to admit, the main motivation for seeing this film is that the woman I fall asleep with and wake up next to each day is Hungarian. But, of course, this has as much to do with Budapest as Hungary do with the World Cup in Brazil this summer. Title aside, this is the new film from Bill Murray director, Wes Anderson: he of oddball comedy film fame, mainly those featuring everyone's favourite Ghostbuster, however small his role may be.The story starts with Jude Law - I know, but don't let that put you off - as a post-war resident of the legendary Grand Budapest Hotel. Intrigued by the hotel's past, he discusses the story of how the hotel came into the hands of its owner, Zero Moustafa, over dinner, leading to the tale of its former concierge, M. Gustave. With Gustave's liking for the older variety of lady, he finds himself caught in a battle for a former lover's inheritance with her children, Zero tagging along. Imprisonment, murder and high-speed skiing chases follow.With the likes of 'In Bruges' in the past, it's always good to see Ralph Fiennes in a film that allows him to deliver a good comedy script. In 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' he again gets that opportunity as M. Gustave, with the film well written as the plot unfolds and keeps the audience entertained. The dialogue is sharp and funny, but in keeping with the European wartime setting, flowing well throughout.Added to the strong script are an interesting animated approach to some of the shots, reflecting Anderson's production of a full animated version before filming the final cut. This is a film with a lot of style.Having a cast of leads, each character seems to be very much 'introduced' into the story, with certain moments almost feeling like a trailer of who is involved. However small the role, much of the cast is Hollywood A-List in cameo form which treads that awkward line of wonder as to whether that's due to the strength of the script or the friends of the director. With so many stars, Anderson gives each their moment in the limelight, with all getting an almost point-of-view monologue to camera. All are also allowed to speak in their native accent, wherever they're from, with American accents rubbing shoulders with English and French under a range of European names. But this doesn't detract from the film, and only adds to its fictional geography.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is definitely one of Anderson's stronger films, if not his strongest, and will no doubt go on to add to its awards. Even a disappointed Hungarian would agree...www.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 November 2021,5/10,"Wes Anderson's style is a unique and quirky. Sometimes that serves the story very well, but in this case, I felt the story was a bit simple and the characters didn't have the depth of some of his past films. The style of it is fun and the visuals are gorgeous though."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 February 2019,8/10,"Every inch in this movie looks visually perfected, every word in the script has a purpose.
Wes Anderson, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, lets his fantasy blossom in 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. He, with the help of everyone involved (costume/setting designers, the huge ensemble of legendary actors, sound department, etc.), manages very well to let the viewers be part of this colorful world.
Yet it felt like a very long 99 minutes and I expected more of the plot. Still a very loveable and appreciated piece of art."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 June 2014,8/10,"Anyone who likes wes anderson films, will like this.You probably won't need to read reviews beforehand as you'll know exactly what to expect. But it's pretty much on the same lines as the Royal Tenenbaums and the life aquatic. Surreal story, the same famous faces popping up. And brilliant, weird comedy. Can honestly say there is nothing not to like about this, thought the jokes might have run dry but if anything I'd say it's one, if not the funniest wes anderson film I've seen. Like Monty Python, the more times you watch, the funnier it gets."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2020,5/10,"Such good acting on show from so many wonderful Actors
Sadly it doesn't even come close to being riveting or even enjoyable.
It's a bore fest
Such a damn shame as it could have been so much better with this wonderful cast"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 March 2017,10/10,"When this Wes Anderson film debuted in 2014, I was only vaguely familiar with the eccentric filmmaker that is Wes Anderson and was curious at this new release. After the movie was available to rent, I immediately went to the library and got my rental. Not knowing what to expect I was braced to may be not like the movie (I had only seen ""The Royal Tennebaums"" at the time), but was laughing myself silly within ten to twenty minutes of the run-time. Wes Anderson managed to blend elements of drama and comedy into the prefect recipe for fun in this delightful romp throughout the film.The film's premise is quite simple: an accomplished writer recounts his trip to the film's titular hotel back in his youth and is subsequently told the tale of how the hotel's current owner came to acquire the hotel. Interspersed with flashbacks we are thrown to a comedic and suspenseful narrative of wrongful accusations of murder, a stolen painting, prison escape, chases and a touching bond between opposite personalities.As expected, director Wes Anderson collects a vast array of colorful actors and actresses to portray the delightfully oddball players of his cinematic world. Outside of normal collaborators in minor roles, the film is bolstered by the dynamically offbeat performance of Ralph Fiennes as the bizarrely eccentric Monsieur Gustav H, the owner of the Grand Budapest in the 1932 flashbacks. Fiennes does bring his usual stoicism to the role, but in a hilarious twist piles on a dignified yet humorously profane comedic persona that is beyond enchanting. There's no shortage of quotable dialogue from M. Gustav as he delivers eloquent poetry, spouts scathing quips or has his off-putting bouts of inserting profanity into his monologues.Aiding Fiennes' wacky concierge is the naive yet eternally loyal Zero, played to near perfection by newcomer Tony Revolori. Revolori brings a youthful zazz to the character as Zero must quickly learn to adapt to his surroundings and the situations he is placed in, but there is even a world weariness to the young man as we later learn of his difficult past prior to arriving in Zubrowka Province at the start of WWII. The chemistry between Fiennes as Gustav and Revolori is so touching as the men become almost like a father and son by the story's end; ""We're brothers"" as Zero states after helping Gustav escape prison and reminding the bewildered concierge why he (Zero) has remained a faithful employee and friend. Bonus to director Anderson for casting Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham as the elder Zero in the 1968 time-line; bringing the wisdom needed to tell the writer the story with gravitas.The film boasts a stellar supporting cast in players like Saoirse Ronan as pastry chef and Zero's loyal and brave girlfriend, Agatha, Tilda Swinton as elderly wealthy widow Madame D (sadly we get little time to see Swinton deliver the goods in her performance but she leaves her mark), Jeff Goldblum as ill-fated lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, Edward Norton as a Nazi-inspired officer who really isn't a horrible guy but only doing his job, and as the film's memorable baddies are Adrien Brody as Madame D's scheming son, Dmitri, and as his muscle is a mostly silent Willem Dafoe as the sinister, sadistic psychopathic Jopling. It's up to the latter two actors to be as villainous as needed without delving into caricatures which both actors do with finesse. Dafoe in particular delivers the chills as he looms in the shadows and menaces unsuspecting targets with little dialogue, somber glares and violent tactics to accomplish means to an end. This is used to perfect effect during the museum chase when Jeff Goldblum's Kovacs tries to elude Dafoe's Jopling; Anderson utilizes the isolation of each exhibit room, sound of footsteps and shadows to build the tension in the scene until the shocking outcome (hint: it doesn't end well for one of them).Director Wes Anderson decides to use a bright color palette for the setting of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" to bring out the whimsy and comedic tones. We are presented with light shades of purple, white snow and various light and bright shades of pink particularly the pink exterior of the film's titular building and then we see the reds, purples and golds of the interior to bring the world to life. There are few dark colors like grays, black and dark blue hues for the villains, the internment camp, the Nazi-style uniforms of the soldiers and the pre-dawn sky.A visual treat, excellent acting and a delightful story that will appeal to any Wes Anderson fan."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 October 2019,9/10,"It was difficult for me to follow the first 9 minutes. But once the flashback began, I loved it. I definitely recommend you watch this movie"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 June 2014,4/10,"What does award worthy cinematography, brilliant set design, milk drinking, flamboyant moustaches, impromptu poetry readings, deadpan facial expressions, characters so eccentric it hurts and weird cheek birthmarks all have in common? You guessed it! All of these aspects play a huge role in the new Wes Anderson film.I hope you're sitting down, but I wasn't crazy about ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Those who are familiar with my more public rants know my feelings regarding writer/director Wes Anderson: A master craftsman when it comes to visual composition, while simultaneously constructing plots and developing characters (and dialogue) which are nearly always eccentrically excessive, rambling and fashionably nihilistic, in the most annoying way possible. That said, upon entering the theater, I did manage to do my duty as a critic and put all past feelings aside.Synopsis: Beginning with a sequence which was described by a critic much smarter than myself as a ""hipster inception"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" tells the story of a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) annoyingly and constantly referred to as Gustave H., who heads up (you guessed it) The Grand Budapest Hotel and has a fetish for having sex with the elderly. Zero is a lobby boy, annoyingly and constantly referred to as ""lobby boy"" or ""my lobby boy"". The two, for some reason, become friends just in time for Gustave H. to be accused of the murder of one of his many friends with benefits.With a director whose films should always be up for Oscar consideration in every ""visual"" category, there is a lot here which is atheistically pleasing. And if you can get into the type of high brow (or pretentious) humor Anderson is throwing at you, then the 2nd Act is full of funny gags and clever lines of dialogue; some of the funniest situational dialogue Anderson has written since ""Rushmore"".Final Thought: I have a feeling that the people who found this movie hilarious, will point to the ever-winking, ""aren't I clever"" diction, which goes hand in hand with the classic Anderson motif of proper people acting silly, as some sort of defense of their proclamation that ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is one of the best films of the year. And to be fair, unlike ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", this is a film which contains a halfway interesting plot (inspired by the writings of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig). But meanwhile (in reality) this movie is way too eccentric for anyone who doesn't already worship at Anderson's feet. And in the end, the 3rd Act dwindles into nothing, so what's the point, really?"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2014,1/10,"I can barely bring myself to write a summery of plot. I gave up paying attention after 15 minutes. A hotel employee is framed for the murder of one of the frequenters but none of it is actually essential to the filming of a project that most likely appeals to Wes Anderson fans only. With a pinch of 30's slapstick here and a steal from Burton there, one finds himself a hostage for 2 hours having already paid the admission fee. Familiar faces come and go as the ridiculous and overbearing Anderson antics occupy the screen. Repetition is not a problem here. The jokes are funny only when on certain drugs and the story a mere vehicle that could have been about a snowflake falling in love with a cloud if it would provide the required running time and the opportunity to set a handsome decor. Though Fiennes gives us one of his best performances to date, I wouldn't recommend this juvenile exercise in self-indulgence to anyone."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 June 2018,9/10,"I've found that amongst movie-goers Wes Anderson seems to be a bit polarizing. I'm one of those folks that falls somewhere in the middle regarding his work. I had modest expectations for The Grand Budapest Hotel but have to say I enjoyed it immensely. All of the performances are good and all of the characters are so unique and interesting. Each of them is unique in a way that for me was real and believable, and therefor someone I could relate to. In particular I found the Lobby Boy and his loyalty to the Fiennes character very endearing. Visually it was continually interesting and the hotel, along with the decor, and mannerisms of this film did have an elegant, reserved, old-world feel to it, which added a new dimension to my enjoyment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2018,9/10,"This film is the true definition of ""you cant judge a book by its cover"" because I genuinely believed I was going to hate this film when I originally saw it over 4 years ago. The experience of watching this film was breath-taking and stayed with me for ages and even still today its brings a smile to my face and a sense of enjoyment.Strangely before seeing the film I had not heard of Wes Anderson as a film maker, his name had never really come up before, however I would never forget his name afterwards. This film is truly remarkable start to finish, from the star studded cast to the fantastical journey this film takes, every part is immaculate. I was and am still astounded by the directing style of Anderson especially in this film, it fits so well with the story begin told and the time period. I have no idea the technical term for his camera movements and style but its quite unlike anything else I have ever seen still to this day. Absolutely incredibly achievement.The story is a fantastical adventure that has so many twists and turns, keeping the flow and the rhythm of the film at a perfect pace. In essence this film is a story of a hotel from the perspective of an long time employee/owner, set back against this magical wonderland that is perfect. The story does get very complex with all the moving parts and the amount of characters that are dotted throughout it, truly brilliant. The story is propelled by the incredible dialogue which is mesmerising, it is a fantastic mixture of language of the day with a modern twist here and there. Some of the wittiest dialogue I have ever heard. I cant imagine the time it took to come up with the script for this film.The cast are all superb nobody has an off day, there are some many names to chose from but there are a couple of standouts. Obviously Ralph Fiennes is truly remarkable and a role that was perfectly suited for him. It is straight to think because in theory the character doesn't really match up with what you expect with Fiennes, but wow is he incredible. Did he get nominated for any awards?? The other standout has to be Tony Revolori who is just brilliant as ""Zero"" witty but innocent at the same time, the character becomes more and more like Gustave H, (Fiennes), as the film progresses. Really good performance. The last two positives are the effects and the score. The effects used in this film to either show the landscape or the action scenes are purposely made to look dated as if the film was actually made during the time period. The skiing montage is truly fascinating as to how they achieved the look, the same must be said for Willem Dafoe riding on the motorbike. All of the landscapes of the film are like water paintings rather than a physical location or CG which only adds to the unique quirkiness of the film. The last positive is the score which is really good, quite haunting and sombre at the same time, the sort of thing that would be played at a funeral. (I'm taking about the choir part of the score).Overall 95% out of 100 or 9.5 out of 10, Wes Anderson has made a film that was break-taking and helped to form my own opinion about film. He still is on my radar still to this day as a director to look out for, saying that I didn't see ""Isle of Dogs"" oops. This film is for everyone and it will make you smile, laugh and cry. This is the reason why I love film, magically brilliant in all its quirkiness."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 January 2015,6/10,"Location, Location, Location! But of what? The Boy With Apple painting? That MacGuffin should have been at least akin to modern abstract, as to avoid distraction in comparison with renowned masterpieces. The painting appeared rank amateur and found it wanting for such a coveted prize.Now onto that pastry! It looked so succulent and mouthwatering, I have never seen a comparable creation, it would provide immense gratification after enduring this film. I was rather bored for the most part and when pastry items ignite my interest, it does not bode well for a great review.I was unaware of the plot, script, actors involved, or reviews, so went in with an objective mindset. I was astounded with the number of high profile talent appearing in surprising roles that, after the aforementioned pastry, I anticipated who would show up next. I recently watched Ed Norton in ""Fight Club"" and seeing him dressed in gestapo gear provided some much needed hilarity! The beautiful vistas from precarious positions were breathtaking and filled many weary scripted scenes. I imagine that a significant portion of the budget was dedicated to talent which translates to an insufferable script. The directing was plodding and predictable but hard to hit all four cylinders in this type of ""I already knew who done it"" farce.Recommend for notorious compilation of similar scripts with a new twist: include every A-Lister alive and voila, exasperating formula!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 September 2020,9/10,"Yeah not only was it beautiful in its colors and choice of scenes the main character was beautiful in his ideals and English refinement. A very strong cast here. The screen play was special and the directing was done just as special. Incredibly low budget of 25 million, not sure how they pulled that off."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 March 2014,8/10,"At last! A movie that has some quality . After all of the crap I've been tricked into watching lately I was a bit wary going in, but it turned out that I was being too pessimistic. Everybody in the cast gave us our money's worth and the storyline moved along at a perfect pace. Great scriptwriting with intelligent jokes that kept you on your listening toes throughout the film. Fiennes was fantastic and Dafoe wasn't too far behind (even though he didn't say much) Cameo appearances by just about everybody only added to the enjoyment but it did have me asking the question ""How do these guys find the time, with all of the other projects they have on the go?"" Anybody with a half decent sense of humour and a quick wit will find that the time flies by as you chuckle in your seat. Go see it and come out feeling like you've just seen one of the better shows around. Enjoy BillC"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 June 2014,10/10,"I just watched the movie and I'm not even sure if I understood all the implications of what I saw: I wonder if the settings, the register of the dialogues, the many and many things that delighted me meant more than what appeared at first sight. If something hidden hit me. I can only say that in the end I was really touched, as if I were in love with what I just watched. I think it was the brilliance of a human mind that struck me so much.I never read Stefan Zweig's writings although I'm aware of how great a writer he was. I'm particularly intrigued now by his autobiography, 'The World of Yesterday', if for no other reason than for the fact that he completed it the day before he took his life. But while watching this film I couldn't help but thinking of the great deal the Author owed to Georges Remi's Tin Tin for the relentless action, the silhouettes, the endless running and the overall imagery.There are no flaws in this film, I can only state my admiration."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2019,8/10,"In spite of an innocuous and an elusive story, I'm surprised it wasn't that boring. The attention to the details that went into making it was really good! The colors, the music, the buildings, the costumes and the videography. All of those are really done well.
Also, the characters and their worldviews are very unique.
Its attraction is a rather beauty of shots and characters' personality than the actual story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 February 2018,8/10,I went in to this movie not knowing anything about its plot or story. I only knew it was about the adventures of some hero from a Budapest Hotel. Honestly I didn't think this movie was going to be any good since its plot wasn't that much interesting but I though I'd give it a try since it was the only movie from the 2015 Oscars highlights I didn't saw. Now I can say that I was not wrong because this movie succeeds as a comedy with some absurd scenes that had me laughing very hard and with characters that are really well done. Aside from that this movie in my opinion had some issues. Mainly the story is very weird told and I was bored for most of the movie although I understood the main thing of the movie and this whole adventure Gustavo and Zero had. The movie never emphasised the characters who were important to the story... I get the movie had to be absurdly funny but you need to catch the viewer's attention with a plot that can be followed and interesting and characters that are introduced properly. I was continuously asking myself who's this? who's that? because the movie's story went on like I was supposed to know who those characters were. But putting that aside there were things I liked like the absurd humor that sometimes had me laughing very hard and the way the movie was constructed. It's been told like a multi-layered story that goes from present to the past with 4 levels of story which made it really interesting in that perspective. Apart from that there were some extremely well done scenes and the movie as a whole was very colorful with some of the best cinematography (I honestly would have given the oscar for cinematography to this movie not to Birdman) although I literally can't understand how Interstellar was not nominated that year. Overall a funny movie with some interesting characters and a multi-layered story and absurd humor. 8/10
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,1/10,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Based on a preview trailer my wife and I saw at a theater recently, and based on reviews and other small things we'd seen in the interim, both of us went to the theater yesterday to see ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014). Evidently, it is so popular it is showing in three different parts of the theater we attended! Well, within five minutes - I literally mean five minutes - of the beginning, the 'humor' had dropped to a sophomoric level. Within ten minutes the attempt had dropped to freshman level. By fifteen minutes of the show, the scene had shifted from the Grand Budapest Hotel to another place and I was beginning to wonder where this - this thing - was going. We were now at an eighth grade level, and all was looking as if it were going to skip a few grades - downward - in the very near future. By an hour into this - thing - I was looking how many people I needed to crawl in front of to leave, and I realized it was far too many. Willm Dafoe had turned into a Hannibal Lecter-like nasty without the hunger pangs, just sadistic beyond three-year-old anger fits. Ralph Fiennes' lines had become so cynical - and this was supposed to be funny! - that the humor level had dropped to near unborn - it was far below Kindergarten. Although it is a delicacy in Tuscany, kid veal is illegal in the United States where veal needs to be at least two and a half years of age. Humor should be the same way. Unborn humor should be illegal here, too. I know of no place where it is a delicacy, however. By the time the hour and forty minutes of the film had passed, we both realized that we had witnessed no movement of the stars: rather, the show was more a movement of the bowels. We realized that the characters were possibly not as dysfunctional as the writers themselves had been. We also realized that the film was a function of Dis. Hell hath mo' fury when a man is horned. All's hell that ends in hell. We'd been there, and now we could finally leave and go get a pizza. I wasn't necessarily hungry, but I ate voraciously if only to forget..."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2014,2/10,"As with RUSHMORE, DARJEELING, MOONRISE KINGDOM, ZISSOU, etc., GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is all style, no substance. I would say it's cinema for cinema's sake, but this isn't even cinematic, it's just desperately visual. There are zero ideas. Every scene strikes the same note. The characters are mannered and empty of interest. There's some visual wit, but almost no verbal wit. Wes Anderson, the mysteriously admired director, seems to have gotten all his skills from watching sketch comedy on TV. Weird people, weird situations, weird visuals-- that seems to be enough for him. He uses an inner circle of friends/ actors, and often chooses to feature people who aren't even actors in lead roles (that includes the expressionless Jason Schwartzman who, happily for the audience, has only a minor role in this film). Actors who really need direction, e.g. Edward Norton and Adrien Brody, languish in Anderson's hands.As for plot and content: If Anderson is aware of what Central Europe was like as Hitler rose to power, he shows no indication of it beyond the trappings-- costumes, set design, both of which are very good, as is the music. Indeed, Alexandre Desplat's score provides the only feeling the movie has. GRAND BUDAPEST is superficial from the first frame to the last-- and an insult to Stefan Zweig. If you see it, watch for the fake Egon Schiele painting, ""Two Lesbians Masturbating,"" and ask yourself, why? Why that subject? My guess: because Schiele is still, almost 100 years after his death, a radical painter-- an adjective Anderson would like applied to himself, though he is really only pretentious, delivering well-funded displays of superficial eye candy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2015,8/10,"I like Mr Anderson. He's quirky. He's funny. He's absurd. He has a superb eye for the use of location and landscape...all qualities the likes of Terry Gilliam, also a social absurdist in his way, appears to have drowned in his interminable visual onanism, in recent years! Anderson also - and this has always been his great strength - to write to the unexpected strengths of his cast. Ralph Feinnes and Tony Revoluri are gloriously funny as the effete, mannered M. Gustave and his Bellhop sidekick, Zero. Willem Dafoe a comically snarling baddie and Adrian Brody similarly vile. There are cameos a-plenty from Anderson stalwarts, slapstick abounds, but however outrageous events become, the script and the characters are always at the forefront. Very good."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 March 2020,9/10,An old man tells his story to another man about his early years as a lobby boy at The Grand Budapest Hotel in 1932. What you get is a very quirky mad cap caper film that is highly entertaining and very funny. Ralph Fiennes plays the consierge who is the lobby boys mentor. Ralph puts in one of his best performances he is very funny and spits out lines in a very witty way. This film has a great ensemble cast and has some great lines and set pieces. I loved the production design and costumes. I really enjoyed this film. Highly recommend it.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 April 2021,5/10,"I try and like every Wes Anderson movie because of the creativity and beautiful cinematography. Unfortunately the plot is however weird and confusing and expected. It's a hard watch, and I don't think it's really that worth it either - as when a movie is hard to watch it should really live up to the investment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 March 2015,5/10,"I really looked forward to seeing this Movie as it has had numerous good reviews, and nominations for Awards. It did prove a disappointment to me, in that the ""humorous"" bits mainly turned out to be unfunny, and the slapstick situations had me looking for Inspector Clouseau to appear. The photography was excellent, and a joy to look at. Unfortunately, the most enjoyment I had was looking for the stars as they appeared in cameo parts, such as Edward Norton, F. Murray Abraham and Jude Law, etc. All in all , I fail to see how it was nominated in the Best Picture Category for the Oscars, when there were a number (despite the volume of films that were nominated) that were overlooked."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 December 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson delivers a film that is presented in one of the most unique ways i have seen especially in modern cinema. Everything from the dialogue to the amazingly unique shooting techniques have been carefully thought out and refined to create this comedic and heart felt film. The acting performances were all very distinct and all very well portrayed by the actors. The standout performances being Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, one putting in one of the better performances of his career and the other making himself known to the world with this amazing debut to film. This film had a very different and specific style of humor that is not typically used in modern comedies. This both helped to film but i think also slightly hurt it. It did take a little while to understand the humor the director was going for, but once i did it became more clear how it was being used with the overall plot. The plot was an interesting one that takes you back through time and doesn't spend too long in a single location, which really helps to move the film along quickly and provide a variety of scenery. In the end it is the directing techniques used by Wes Anderson that really make this film shine. - 8.3"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 May 2014,9/10,"Made with Wes Anderson's normal fastidious attention to detail, with careful compositions and eccentrically droll characters (with the exception of the inspired M. Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes, a mannered sophisticate with just the right amount of rapscallion that instead of quirky tics, he's a man of desires and decency, an almost real human being). The Grand Budapest Hotel operates on a more plot-centric level than any of Anderson's previous films, and yet retains all his charms and idiosyncrasies, yet by not flaunting his mannerisms as character development or deepness of thought, he actually winds up saying more about everyone and everything by letting them speak for themselves. The melancholy passing of the old world is captured in the sheer joy and exuberance of the scenes taking place there, so that when we are lurched back to the present and the film slows down and hits the notes of normal Anderson faire, it carries with it a sense of loss and sorrow.The juxtaposition of the looming war, with its brutality and chaos, also inspires the scenes in the past as they are full of atypical for Anderson indecency. From the dropping of F-bombs to the explicit, yet not grotesque, gore. These seeming anachronisms, that work on two different levels, are both funny and deep and since they don't just have to be deep they actually work perfectly.The movie plays out in three different aspect ratios, a fun little treat for cinema fans who notice. Although it should be said that the majority of the film takes place in the past and as such uses a near full screen ratio (a relic of old European films), which is a little disappointing considering how gorgeous the filmmaking is. It could have been bigger and better.It bares repeating, Ralph Fiennes, always a great actor, here gets to show his comedic chops in what feels like forever, and liberated he is an absolute joy in every frame of the film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,6/10,"""You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughter house that was once known as humanity"". If there was ever a quote to sum up the films of Wes Anderson, this would be high on the list. Highly inventive, absurd, and at times, narratively incoherent, Anderson's eighth feature film is a grand, accommodating feature whose self is probably not as grand as the cast it has rounded out.From Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Kietel, Bob Balaban, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, to regulars Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and of course Bill Muarry, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a formidably full house of A-list actors who happily lend their skills to the highly inventive and immensely visual Anderson. Aside from the wholly impressive cast, is the quirky and unmistakably unique vision of Anderson himself.If you haven't been fortunate enough to experience a Wes Anderson film yet, you are surely missing out on one of the most elaborate, detailed, and symmetrical styles of film-making ever known. Anderson's style, renown and admired by many, may very well be the American indie art-house King and The Grand Budapest Hotel may very well be his grandest and most admirable spectacle yet–although it may not be his most engaging or beloved.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an empirical picture, in every sense of the word. Throughout his career as a writer/director, Anderson has defined and refined his vision to the point that every heist; every adventure; or every group of individuals, can easily be distinguishable, as if their existence could only be understood within an Anderson film. The essence of the characters within The Grand Budapest, as well as his overall vision, is creatively maintained thanks to the purity of the scenarios and wackiness of the characters Anderson houses, in whatever setting it may be. For decades now, Anderson has bequeathed to film-lovers everywhere and audiences' alike, a signature style unlike any other.There are countless films where the characters have come secondary only to the immense and elaborate setting they are placed in. For example, in many films urban settings; New York City has played a pivotal role (see: Shame and Annie Hall), The Wild West (see: The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Unforgiven), and exotic locales within Europe set the landscape for timeless stories of intrigue, lust, love and tragedy (see: Vicky Cristina Barcelona and The Bicycle Thief.). In Anderson's world, although many of his settings are within the very real world we live in today, sublets of his world are envisioned within our world, and in essence, these locales become the greatest character of them all, housing very small, intricate tales of the people whose stories are shared in its presence. The setting this time, is none other than the Grand Budapest. A hotel, that houses the highly empathetic new lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori) and his journey to becoming the irreplaceable sidekick to the one and only infamous concierge M. Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). Among the many other patrons of the hotel and each of their individual secrets, tall tales, and life memories, Anderson centres the film around a priceless painting, now put in the hands of Gustave thanks to death of M. Gustave's latest deceased romance, the mysteriously elder Madame D (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton). What transpires, is an array of fantastical plot schemes and recanted storytelling that may only make sense when mentioning the name of Wes Anderson.Like any other Anderson film, the stories are only secondary to their execution. Anderson's films are the closet things to mathematical proofs, where the process of plot-making comes first before the final, usually predictable and happy outcome. Anderson may have come off one of his most cherished screenplays with his last film Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel may in no way trump it, but thankfully, it never tries. Instead, after exploring the unfathomable bond between young lovers, Anderson penetrates deep and long the affections of friendship and the importance of patronage within the industry of service and hospitality. Surprisingly this is a theme that he has yet to encounter, especially after his beloved muse and frequent collaborator Kumar Pallana passed and served as nothing less than a staple to the Anderson cannon. Think of The Grand Budapest Hotel as a large and completely dysfunctional family taking care of you, much like Anderson's earlier work The Royal Tenenbaums, only this time, imagine them slotted at the other end of a hotel reception desk.In recent superhero films, including the abysmal Spider-Man 3, some of studios biggest let- downs are due to saturation of talent. Many directors, usually overwhelmed with fitting in actors, story lines, and significant narrative points, are unable to tend to the large range of highly versatile skills many character actors possess. But, as seen with his raw and disturbing state of family life, Anderson has a natural knack for understanding and using large casts to his advantage. Never taking up more screen time than needed, each face, each actor and each role is given its due diligence and serves a purpose, always elevating the unbelievability of his stories. His characters are merely caricatures of the people Anderson imagines, and it can only be seen that we, as an audience, are allowed a faint glimmer inside this imagination.The Grand Budapest Hotel truly lives up to the Anderson name. As incredibly talented and always enigmatic, the work of this visual artist/filmmaker, will continue to be studied, analyzed and understood, well beyond his death. Anderson is mostly concerned with the indulgence of life. Thankfully, using his neon bright cast to highlight a dull and ubiquitous story of hidden secrets and falsification, new light is shed on a world and a man whose purity and pleasure in movie making art, is like the enjoyment of a fine French pastry."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 June 2018,9/10,"If you like Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. Witty, entertaining and pleasant, it is a comedy in his unique style, that hits all the tones and notes that make him a unique and original director."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2014,8/10,"Would you like to take a vacation in Europe and stay in a luxurious hotel situated in the mystical mountains? While at it enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of the country in mind tingling details? Then think no further, the doors of The Grand Budapest Hotel is open for you. The Grand Budapest Hotel (GBH) is not just a movie but an experience in a whole different level. If you were not blown out by its grace then you must see a doctor immediately. This is by far in my opinion the best Wes Anderson movie that takes the viewer in an epic journey through the fictional land of Zubrowa and a hotel named The Grand Budapest.The tale of GBH is told from perspective of Zero (Tony Revolori) a lobby boy who works for the hotel. And he works under the talented and charismatic concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes.) These two brings us a story so unfamiliar and whimsically magnificent, a story of romance, fantasy and above all adventurous. And from the very start to the ending scene you will not blink because it looks that delicious.If you recall Wes Anderson's earlier works like Moonrise Kingdom (2012), The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) you already know that he has a style of his own and Wes's movies looks insanely detailed. But GBH surpasses all of them and gives realism a new definition. It's a mix of miniature models, live sets and computer animation that makes this movie by far one of the most memorable of that sort. When you get used to the brilliant looks of the film then you start to engulf in the characters. And the finest and the impressive cast will not let you rest a minute. GBH unveils a parade of talented and well-known actors character by character just like it unveils its beautiful story. Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray and Edward Norton are few of them. And the mix of cinematography and performance is complete by seemingly synchronizing and fabulously ear pleasing score by Alexandre Desplat who has dozens of compelling movie scores under his belt. This movie is not just a movie that you will only enjoy while watching. It is like some delicious desert you had while enjoying your most anticipated holiday on the cold mountains. You will recall its taste over and over again and will be mesmerized by it. And those brilliant sequences of the funniest jail break, cable car ride on to the steep mountains, high speed chase down a snowy slope will be steadily embedded in your brain. And that's just the tip of the ice berg."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 July 2014,8/10,"Ridiculously detailed to every nook right down to very twirls at the end of moustache of Mr.Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a must watch for the fans of Wes Anderson. His rather unorthodox animation of FANTASTIC MR.FOX drew attention to quite the number of critical stinkers although personally it was enjoyable to me. Quite similarly TGBH too contains Anderson's eccentricity in the perfection of detailing which is the core pillar of the success of the blisteringly comical motion picture.TGBH isn't snarled, devious or unfathomable to the audience as grandeur as the title wants it to sound. The opulence lies in the minimalism. The ostentatious and foolish escapade of Mr.Gustave (probably the only concierge to reach the Hall of Fame for concierges if ever there was one) and his lobby boy is all what TGBH is about. Mr.Gustave if one may say so is undeniably a ""Play-AH"" and his type is mature, rich, blonde women (GOLD DIGGER!). As all men he knows how to handle his ladies and still be a hit at the office. Mr.Gustave sails a tight ship. Perfection is something he harps on with daily meetings with the staff which is preposterously entertaining. Although Fiennes has proved his versatility in acting it's hard to see him beyond Lord Voldermort to many in the audience. It further will astonish and amuse the audience since this is by far the best performance of Fiennes one is certain to see. OMG YOU ARE GONNA LOVE HIM!The lion-share of the credit is indeed deposited under the name of Fiennes. How can one not credit the amazing, rude and at times intentionally mental performances of Bill Murray, Jude Law, William Dafoe, Adrian Brody, Edward Norton, Tony Revolori & Owen Wilson? It is not a surprise if one can be overwhelmed with the overpowering of star- power. On many occasions directors are belittled for having an overabundance of household Hollywood names to cover the drawbacks of the script or the direction – but not this time. Most of the success is seeing the stars portray these eccentric characters. I spurted my soda out when Edward Norton got his first share of screen time; it's just too funny!Another paradigm to look at TGBH is the vision Wes Anderson may have had for this motion picture. The parallel existence in which everything comes to life is obviously not as realistic as THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL purely because of the colors, but still in hindsight it looked too real not to be true. Anderson seems to have thrown a fit with the costuming and props department. There is finesse in every aspect of every turn. One cannot describe how detailed the production is until witnessed by one's own eyes. Wes Anderson I vouch to watch every other movie you are ever to make! I am your newest fan. Superb work.Lastly before every reader is misguided, TGBH is mostly word play and isn't slapstick or rude humor as in Bachelor parties in Vegas or Thailand. If that's your game TGBH is her name!TITLE: THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL DIRECTED BY: WES ANDERSON STARRING: RALPH FIENNES, TONY REVOLORI, WILLIAM DAFOE, ADRIAN BRODY, EDWARD NORTON, OWEN Wilson & BILL MURRAY RATED: R RATING : 08/10 RUNTIME: 100 MINUTES"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2015,7/10,"In what is surely the most weird movie nominated at this year's Oscars, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that feels like a painting come to life, and in that process adding a sense of quirky adventure that will feature the most random of characters. A rousing appreciation has to be given to Ralph Fiennes for giving a comedic performance for the ages. Perhaps not the most Academy Award worthy performance in the eyes of some, but definitely a stand out from the more dramatic roles that earned high praise this year.This film is yet another project from Wes Anderson that has his mark written all over it. I believe that Wes Anderson is about as close as you'll come to an American director that has a very European style to his films. His American cast counterparts in the movie bring that Hollywood vibe to an other wise independent project. Overall the production values of Grand Budapest Hotel are some of the best of the year. Beautiful cinematography, set design and a smooth directorial effort make for a beautiful movie to behold. On the writing and acting side of things, we get a throwback to the times of screwball comedies. I would say this is the modern screwball movie prototype. Once again, all of the highest praise goes to Fiennes for giving us a wonderful character that not only makes you laugh at the right times, but to a certain degree intrigues you. Throughout the extensive cast there are many good turns, yet our most inexperienced member Tony Revlori more than holds up against our leading man, making for a very believable friendship between the two in the movie.It's not every day that I watch a movie like this. In fact, this is my first Anderson movie, and I gotta say that his style can go either way with me. While I hold off for a while on seeing more of his movies, I leave The Grand Budapest Hotel with a solid score and with the memory of being thoroughly entertained by it.Rating: 7/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2014,8/10,"If you have seen my anticipated 2014 list, then you probably already guessed that I would review this film and its about time. I am still a bit underwhelmed with some of the aspects of this film, such as the development of the relationships. But Anderson's artistic view has not been damaged at all. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's latest film coming out of his masterpiece Moonrise Kingdom.The narrative of the film is filmed very interestingly. The movie, is filmed into 3 camera ratios. 1.33, 1.85, and of course, 2.35:1 each for different time lines. The story is about a girl who reads a book called The Grand Budapest Hotel, written by a man named Author. Author is the narrator of this film and tells us about an encounter of a man he had met at the GB Hotel in the late 60's. He meets a man named Zero, who he is interested in telling him his adventures as a bellboy in 1932.He is under the control of M. Gustave H. The owner of the hotel. But a few days later, things get worse. One of Gustave's Lovers, Madamme D, is killed from poisoning and on her will leaves him a painting called ""Boy With Apple"" but an Angry son Dmitri refuses to let him have it. Zero and Gustave have no choice but to steal it and things become increasingly dangerous as Dmitri sets out to find Gustave and Zero with Jopling, a very scary assassin who is ruthless (Ex. He slams a door on one of the major characters Kovac's fingers and they get cut off.) Zero must go on a journey to prove that Gustave is innocent.Starting with the Production Design, it looks amazing. Wes Anderson is known for using a style to attract people's attention to the story which is a brilliant way of getting an audience to care about the movie. The Hotel is fantastic with its huge rooms, service and much more. The costumes are very colorful, with purple and yellow being one of many colors of the gorgeous costumes.Anderson's regulars are all back with Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson return. But to my disappointment, people like Murray and Wilson are wasted. You only see about a minute of them on screen so we can focus on major characters. In fact, why bother having Murray and Schwartzman at all? The movie could have been better without the characters of M. Chuck and M. Ivan.All the actors are incredible in this film, the best of the bunch being Brody and Willem Dafoe as Jopling. They are some of the most memorable villains in recent cinema memory. Jopling I like the most because he frightens me a lot. Who wouldn't be scared of a man who can decapitate your head and put it into a laundry basket or throwing your cat out the window? But some of the relationships in the film like with Zero and Agatha are under developed and don't explain very much how they fell in love. Was it love in first site? The script gives hint to that, but its not confirmed.As I said before, the narrative is great thanks to the Camera work. When you first see the 1.33 ratio, you know your going to go on a classic epic adventure with memorable characters. Its a throwback to some of the greatest epics of all time.This movie will not disappoint Wes Anderson fans even though it is the weakest of his movies I have seen. But it will appeal to many people and hopefully the movie does well in the theater and on Blu Ray also.85/100 B"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,8/10,"Definitely a noteworthy film in its technicals. From the costumes, to the actors, to the story, to the cinematography, everything is very well made. The ensemble cast is irresistibly combined with the tragically interesting story with a very humorous touch to it.An author (Tom Wilkinson) recounts his story of visiting a dying grand hotel, in which the owner, (F. Murphy Abraham) sits him down and tells his story of how he became in possession of it, as he recounts his service as a lobby boy and his association with M. Gustave, (Ralph Fiennes) the hotel's concierge.The film is fast paced and very clever with its dark humor and dramatic hooks. Despite who may or may not be a bad guy, everybody is likable in some sense, from their goofy antics to their unusual appearances, (Willem Dafoe).The film looks beautiful. Its colors are vibrant and the camera style is amazing. Not being one on makeup or costumes, the costumes are very creative in this, complimenting the art direction and style of the settings. Everybody in this is irresistible, even small roles that include Bill Murray and Tom Wilkinson. Ralph Fiennes carries this film with an incredibly underrated character with irresistible charm.It's paced to perfection. It's tightly edited but it's not too fast paced. Its got an unusual humor to it as well. It's not really a black comedy because of how bright it is, but its got subtle dark touches here and there that come out of nowhere, the film is constantly unpredictable, but very easy to follow.In terms of film making, it's somewhat of a masterpiece. Its not something that would impact society in any way, but it's a thrill ride to say the least. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quirky fun comedy with a dark edge."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 July 2014,7/10,"Not quite as funny as Wes Anderson's early ""Bottle Rocket,"" but it has its moments. The cinematography is a real stunner, especially in terms of color and set design. The acting is superb for an off-beat farce. It was refreshing to hear no lame attempts at foreign accents by any of the cast. The running gags had their moments, especially the recitations of absurdly romantic poetry at inappropriate moments. Willem Defoe was a laugh riot just to look at his appearance! He didn't even have to say lines! Anderson, Gilliam, and the Coens are all similar in their approach to surreal comedies, and if you enjoy this genre, you'll like GBH."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 August 2016,5/10,"Wes Anderson's THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is the director's celebration of Central Europe culture and fashion in the years between the World Wars, and an elegy for what was lost with the rise of fascism and communism. Set in 1932 in a fictional country called Zubrowka, the streets, military regalia and (ersatz) German names we are shown could have come from anywhere between Germany and Estonia. Its protagonist Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the eponymous luxury hotel, the splendour of which disappeared, we are told, with World War II. Gustave H. is known publicly as one of the best concierges in the business, able to dash around the hotel at lightning speed to satisfy the most varied guests of the elite clientele. Privately, he's a rake with a rather foul mouth, and fond of bedding the rich old women who patronize the establishment. When one of those old ladies, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) dies and Gustave is framed for her murder, he must evade the law and unmask the true culprit, with the help of newly hired lobby boy Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori).The films of Wes Anderson are known for their immense visual detail, and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is no exception. The elaborate framing of shots, the myriad cute items to look at on every set, and the architectural detail are like a diorama blown up to the big screen. Curiously, that visual detail is matched to a real slackness in the human characterization. Anderson has brought in a number of actors he had worked with before, including Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray, for roles that range from the main villain to little more than cameos. These characters are never fleshed out like Gustave H. or Zero Mustafa, and the actors don't even try to pass themselves off as Central Europeans from the entre deux guerres. Instead Adrien Brody plays Adrien Brody, etc.There are two supporting roles that I felt were stronger. William Defoe plays a nearly mute henchman whose look is a nod to early vampire films (Transylvania was Central Europe, too). More remarkable is Harvey Keitel's turn as an old prisoner: when so many handsome leading men try to hide the effects of time after they enter their sunset years, 75-year-old Keitel was not afraid to show the ravages of old age here.Unfortunately, I found the 21st-century Americans strutting about (and a few speaking in rough New York accents) in a historical drama to be jarring. I was also disappointed by the resort to Hollywood tropes here, when Anderson's earlier films managed to be very quickly and sui generis. For example, did we really need not just one scene where a character is hanging off a cliff's edge as the villain stands over him, but two? And the amount of plot details that are introduced but never really explained makes one feel that the work was subject to some heavy cuts to please a studio.Still, if you liked Wes Anderson's earlier films, you'll find much to enjoy in his dollhouse approach, and it is amazing how every one of his films has a completely new and fresh visual theming even if his quasi-autistic obsession with prettiness never changes. Another thing I liked about the film is its ""story within a story within a story"". The entire plot of Gustave H. is, we are shown, taken from a fictionalized treatment by a writer who met a middle-aged Mustafa in the 1960s. Befitting this novelistic layer (and the work of Stefan Zweig that Anderson credits for inspiration), this framing story is written in stilted, unrealistic dialogue like an old-time novel. And the aspect ratio changes for each layer of the film, a little treat for cinema anoraks."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 November 2014,6/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel... is quirky, odd, slightly off-colour and something you might watch if you don't want to tax your brain too much.Very pretty to look at, if you like scarlet and pink and turquoise all in the same place with some wonderful cinematography.I thoroughly enjoyed it except for the hideous cliché of the cat out the window... I loathe things that make out animal cruelty is funny... and some other bizarre gore which didn't seem to really fit well with the theme, quirky as it all was... this was a huge put-off for me, like finding out in the middle of a fairy tale that someone's been raped.And then at about the 58 minute mark it got stupid for about 5 long, long minutes and annoyed me for another dumb clichéd period of time.The other wild and weird stuff was quite fun. In a different mood I might have hated it but I can't see that in another different mood I would have liked it better.Great cast, all superbly acted, as they always do, so they really redeemed this movie almost entirely. With a different cast it may have been intolerable.Not for everyone."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 November 2018,7/10,"A fantasy, comedic story of the owner of a grand hotel. Luridly coloured, and inventively shot, the story is daft but engaging, with many humorous moments (but few to me were laugh out loud) and the characters and events quirky, but not to the extent of disbelief."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 November 2021,10/10,"This is the film that took all of Wes Anderson's obsessive passions and distilled them into a cinematic snow globe of tremendous beauty. It's my favorite of his movies, I want to say by a large margin - but deep down I know he's one of the best film artists of all time, and everything he's made are gems, and well worth the effort gone into crafting them.For the Grand Budapest Hotel, he pulled the all the stops out and created an endearing Europa fantasia world from scratch, and it's not a world I've ever quite seen before. I would liken it to the efforts of world building gone into films like the Wizard of Oz, Star Wars and 2001, where you're captivated by its epic scope and such sharply defined details that you get swept up in the proceedings without a moment to register the difference between what is real and what isn't.The movie works so well because the basis of the story is as rich and detailed as the icing on Mendl's little pastries; what you're seeing is only complimented by an elaborate, but completely fluid narrative, and a great performance by Ralph Fiennes as Grand Budapest Hotel proprietor Gustav H. The heart is the relationship between Gustav and his young lobby boy / protege Zero Mustafa, and the adventures they find themselves embroiled in are as mesmerizing as the feeling I had when I was a kid raiding the school library and getting lost in books about far off adventures, distant planets, Three Investigator mysteries, and other such things adults aren't supposed to read anymore.I love everything about this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2020,7/10,"Not much revealing about the plot the film is based on a journey which centers around the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film is narrated chapter wise showcasing the 20th century European culture. Many critique has written that this movie is the best Wes Anderson directorial which can be true as the film was nominated for several categories in Oscars including best movie. However for me the best thing for which I personally recommend you to watch this movie is its cinematography and the cultural portrayal of old Europe for which I would specifically like to mention Robert Yeoman the cinematographer for doing his job fabulously and it should be watched once, as far as for rest of the movie I would say that it is more of a Drama rather comedy with some long list of solid and seasoned cast. If you are an art lover then this movie is a must watch for you"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2014,8/10,"Admittedly, I've never been the biggest fan of Wes Anderson's work. Amidst the hype that encompassed every one of his releases, I just couldn't get behind the quirkiness and bizarre sense of humor largely present therein. Back in 2012, I was hoping that Moonrise Kingdom might be the film to win me over, but that unfortunately wasn't the case. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel might well be. First off, Ralph Fiennes might've given one of his career's best performances here, portraying a remarkable, amiable concierge that builds a friendship with the new lobby boy at the hotel as a wild journey ensues from there on. Fiennes manages to carry a fine amount of charisma throughout and perfectly fits into Anderson's type of zany world. Another notable showing is Adrien Brody's convincing role as the scheming villain; he's back in full form here, ladies and gentlemen, as he fully encapsulates obnoxiousness and menace at once. Now, my favorite part of The Grand Budapest Hotel (as with any other Anderson film) was the brilliant, breathtaking production design, and wow, is it one of the best and visually stunning production designs to a film I've ever seen (no exaggeration here, folks)—gorgeously colorful and as charming as can be. While the plot thickens, its viewers take a ride through multitudinous settings all with vastly disparate scenery (whether it be snowy, sullen, or vibrant). Moreover, the film also benefits from exceptionally thoughtful shot composition, leaving you in wonder of how the look—including the visuals—was even pulled off. The cinematography is spectacular, guiding you through surrealist and visually magical locations. Herein, the camera serves as an extremely clever device to beautifully and punctiliously maneuver through Anderson's fastest-paced film yet (lacking the slightest hint of dullness), acting as another intricate element in the story's development. As a result of these meticulously-implemented components (undoubtedly award-worthy costume design, set design, make-up, and the whole bunch), the atmosphere created is absolutely wonderful and a complete joy to be a part of, which is rare for many films and, personally, even rarer for me when it comes to Anderson's films even as graphically enticing as they can be. As I've repeatedly already noted how far removed I am from an Anderson fan, I'm certainly not the only one since these films obviously aim for a niche audience and are definitely not for everyone. Nonetheless, The Grand Budapest Hotel is palpably the most accessible film from his filmography seeing how he presents us with a surely entertaining comedic mystery that glides along thrillingly—bountifully fueled with adventure— thanks in large part to its swifter editing style. In spite of that, it could still be a very peculiar film that's also targeted towards a more specific audience simply owing to the fact that everything from the characters to the events are immensely over-the-top and seemingly cartoonish in typical Anderson fashion. Although, the picture presents its outlandish content with such confidence that some of the more illogical and nonsensical activities that would otherwise harm a standard film aren't even remotely distracting here due to the smart introduction and build-up on a unique tone from the very start. In comparison to the film's majestic appearance, the story, itself, isn't as memorable or stimulating as its overall technical design, but it can still be fairly humorous at times, wittily utilizing many well- known and beloved actors in cameos or more significant roles to excellent comedic effect. In the end, Anderson's latest provides enough warmth, thrills, and beauteous mis-en-scène to allure the most casual of moviegoers, thankfully not relying as much on self-indulgence and narrow, discrete humor as his other films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 April 2020,9/10,"At first, I thought it just told a story of legacy dispute. Then, I found there exised love and friendship beyond the country, culture and values. Finally, I realized that behind this story the dark clouds of politics and war always hung over it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 September 2021,10/10,"OMG!!! I just love and adore this movie so much! I'm willing to watch it more than once. I love the story, the cast, the sound, the cinematography. Everything! There's nothing I regret for picking this movie last night. It was so great!!!That lobby boy is so funny, his face. No words out of his mouth, still I laughed out loud. And Ralph Fiennes just kills it. Hands up for the make-up artist too for making Tilda looks so old, lonely, and ugly hahaha. I still wonder if this hotel and the painting and the people in it are truly exist. And also the book."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 September 2014,8/10,"www.tgchan.pl Yes, yes and yes... this is one of these very arty and weird kind of movies. 30minutes has passed since I have started it. So far I am little confused what's going on but I can already see high quality of the movie. Every camera angle is very well thought, shots are beautiful and you want to pause every one of them just to enjoy the given place. Music is very well synchronized and fitted pleasantly with the action going on the screen. ""The best music in a movie is the one you can't hear without thinking about it."", and it surly is the case in that movie. At first it was a little boring but the action has already started now and I feel sucked in considerably. I am eager to see what will happen next and I want to absorb this weird aura of artistry more and more.I really liked seeing lots of well known actors scattered all over the movie: Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Owen Wilson and probably few more. Every person in the movie is very well created and colourful character, with a little note of grotesque.You'll have many occasions to laugh because of over-saturated scenarios which are great! It sometimes feels almost like you are watching a cartoon (in a good sense of its meaning, of course).This and my other mini reviews are written in few parts. The first part, I write after few minutes of the movie (first impression), the second one somewhere in a middle of it, and the third and last one, right after I finish the whole thing.What an amazing way to tell a story about the hotel... What an exceptional way to show simple things in colourful light... You can feel pure art touch in every part of the movie! This movie is not about the story but all about showing how things are done by a true artist!tgchan's rating 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,8/10,"Director Wes Anderson makes films on his terms, it is unlikely he gets many ""notes"" from the studio making suggestions and changes. If they were watching closely, they would probably just shut production down.How Anderson manages to get these projects financially across the line and with the ""A-List"" talent on-board is not our concern. The films exist and it is up to the audience to decide if this is a good or bad thing.Anderson's films are an acquired taste and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is no exception.We enter a highly stylized world where the story, loosely inspired by Stefan Zweig is largely told in flashback.We first meet the ""Older writer"" (Tom Wilkinson) who has written the book on ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", he recounts his recollections in-between distractions provided by his grandson.We then move to Young(er) Writer (Jude Law) and Mr Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) quietly eating lunch in the now severely down at heel 1960's set hotel, as the 1932 story then unfolds in extended flashbacks. Resembling Russian Babushka dolls in complexity, it feels easier to watch than explain in a review.The Grand Budapest hotel exists in a fictional European country, the hotel is luxurious and the clientèle are beautiful, wealthy and if female, usually regularly serviced, in every sense of the word by the fastidious concierge ""Gustave H"" (Ralph Fiennes). Most notably Madame D (Tilda Swinton) who simply cannot live without Gustave and senses impending doom.The hotel is run at the whim and command of Gustave, who also has an easy way with providing favours and receiving them in return. The new ""Lobby Boy"" aka ""Zero"" (Tony Revolori) requires training and this provides an opportunity for the audience to experience Gustave's quirks, mannerisms and mode d'emploi.Over time and under his close supervision, the ""Lobby Boy"" becomes an integral part of the hotel service team, at once visible when required and invisible when not. The world is good until bad news is received and Gustave and Zero are required to take a train ride to attend a will reading led by the executor ""Deputy Kovacs"" (Jeff Goldblum).Gustave has known that war is likely in the region and the pair are stopped by Inspector Henckels (Edward Norton) part of the ""ZZ"" security forces. These troops allude to a Nazi like oppression but this frames the story rather than becomes an integral part. On this occasion Gustave's connections allows them safe passage but we will meet this inspector again later.Once the will is read, this provides the movies ""Macguffin"" to allow the rather bizarre plot to unfold as a rare and very valuable ""Boy with Apple"" renaissance painting, is acquired, hidden, lost, searched for etc.The story involves prison lags (Harvey Keitel), evil henchmen (Willem Dafoe), a frustrated son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), the Society of Crossed Keys (Bill Murray) and Gustaves replacements (Owen Wilson and Jason Schwatzman). Gustave spouts poetry at every turn, usually (thankfully) interrupted, as his choice of time and place leaves something to be desired.We also get time, just, to squeeze in a romance between ""Zero"" and local artisan patisserie baker (Saoirise Ronan), someone who becomes integral to the plot as it progresses.The film is highly stylized in the usual Anderson manner, real yet unreal and with characters acting with poker faces throughout, however crazy and comedic the situations. Digging colossal tunnels with tiny spoons and hammers, with no attempt at realism. With the usual mixture of detailed sets, deliberately shoddy effects on occasion (hand drawn cable cars) and occasional macabre details this is known territory for fans of the directors movies. There is also a fair dollop of ""F"" Bomb's, occasionally in unexpected places. Whether the occasional violent dip and language adds to the film is debatable.Fienne's excels in his role ""Take your hands off my Lobby Boy"" is a T-Shirt slogan waiting to happen. All the cast acquit themselves well, some in almost cameos yet clearly keen to work for Anderson for salary scale (otherwise the film would not get made). Wilkinson, F Murray Abraham add gravitas, Defoe is as usual bonkers and the young lovers add a sweet centre to the story.Overall a whole lot of fun, at turns inventive, well acted, daft, touching and just plain silly, so a perfect Wes Anderson movie then.Summary Think ""Amelie"" or Anderson's own ""Moonrise Kingdon"" but without any happy endings and with darker situations.The film may represent a Marmite movie event, you will love it or hate it. For those that stick around and enjoy this form of intellectual silliness, there is much to enjoy here."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 May 2020,8/10,"A very special movie, the color structure is very beautiful The story is also very interesting."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 January 2015,9/10,"I'm not going to go into much detail on the storyline as I don't want to ruin anything; I will simply state the reasons why I enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel.Gustave H is an eccentric, colourful, well established hotel concierge who runs the Grand Budapest Hotel using his own quirky style and approach. He has a lobby boy named Zero Mustafa who he works alongside. Before long the two of them are swept into a series of events that bring them closer, turning them from concierge and lobby boy into loyal friends.The Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson, meaning that it is going to have a Wes Anderson style quirky twist. People have criticised this movie for this, stating that it is trying too hard to be different, I don't agree with this at all. Yes it is different, yes it is quirky and eccentric but it is magical in its own deserved right. It sucked me into the setting and made me feel much immersed in the movie. The Cinematography is faultless, many scenes are filmed on a back drop that is designed to look like a painting, there are scenes that look gimmicky and there are scenes that feel as if you are watching it in a live play! But these are the reasons that The Grand Budapest Hotel is so enjoyable to watch! The humour is fantastic, it is incredibly witty, and the timing of the punch lines and the use of foul language is done splendidly. Ralph Fiennes who plays Gustave H, the hotel concierge is an incredibly likable and well-presented character. His lobby boy, Zero Mustafa is equally as pleasant and their on screen chemistry grows from nothing in the beginning into a real on screen treat. The supporting cast are also very well picked and they all play their character roles equally well, many of which are well- known faces such as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Bill Murray and Jude Law.If you were the split the film into three sections of beginning, middle and end, and were to compare the pace of the film I would say that it dips in the middle section. It starts off fantastically, you are introduced to the characters in a staggered routine and this keeps you hooked, waiting for who is to come next and what role they are to play. The middle does slow down a little and some of the scenes don't live up to the beginning section. It is still entertaining and kept me hooked, but because the beginning was so strong I think the middle seemed deflated because of this. In my opinion It felt slower paced, the two main characters were shown less screen time during this period and I think the film suffered a little because of this. It did however pick up in the final third and the pace was similar to that of the opening part. It ended strongly and left me very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.The Grand Budapest Hotel succeeds due to great direction, cinematography, script and humour. Its characters are fantastic and some of my favourite characters that I have seen in recent films are on display here. The film is only 90 minutes long but this doesn't stop some impressive character development. I can appreciate that this movie isn't for everyone and it has suffered some poor reviews because of this, but in my opinion it was much better than I was expecting and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has since been nominated for Best Picture and I wouldn't argue with that one bit.8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 March 2021,8/10,"By far the best part of this movie is the way it is filmed, every shot is deliberately placed to draw the audience and make it more believable of the set time period. The colours are bright and bold and bring the movie to life while still managing to create dark scenes. The comedy is excellent, it is one of the few occasions where visual comedy is used a lot and it works brilliantly. For those that don't know, visual comedy is when something funny is shown instead of simply telling the audience something, it works far better but is much harder to achieve. The acting is nothing to scoff at either. There are some big names in this movie, most of them having very small parts, it was a very risky move but I feel has worked in favour for the movie. The use of physical miniature models for the chase scene and others further emphasises the time setting but is also so deliberately and obviously fake that it becomes hilarious. The plot is alright and creates for some funny turns, the pacing is generally quite fast for the movie which can affect it in a perhaps negative way...I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. Some of the dialogue I found to be quite hard to follow due to the ostentatious language used by the upper-class individuals. Personally being only 16 I very much enjoyed watching a modern movie stylised to be more like older movies and enjoyed the movie as a whole. 8/10 bangs"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 September 2014,9/10,"Always entertaining and constantly funny 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' introduces us to another beautiful and imaginative world plucked from the mind of Wes Anderson.Its focus remains on Gustave the concierge and Zero the lobby boy. After a wealthy tenant dies and Gustave is named the heir of her fortune, he is also framed and sets out to clear his name and fortune. It's a story unlike Andersons previous films, but he tackled it in the same way he would with any film with unusual characters and a visual beauty leading the story.With a cast with as many big names as this has (Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe to name a few) and many of them having less than 5 minutes screen time you would usually assume that the film would be selling out. Normally you'd be right and such a cast would just be an attempt at cashing in at the box office. But gladly that's not the case. No matter how small the role, every part of this film comes across as both lovable and memorable. Each characters personality is distinct and the actors ensure that no matter how short the screen time they make their presence in the film remembered. Every character feels as if they are vital to the film and every character just makes the film even more charming. Though as good as the entirety of the cast is, Ralph Fiennes still stands out with his memorable performance as the lead Gustave H, the hotel's concierge. Fiennes shows his great talent for comedy through his brilliant delivery. One moment he shall be a refined English gentleman, speaking with grace and modesty as one would expect from any fine concierge. Then the next he swears like a fu*king sailor. Take for example his reaction when he sees 'Boy With Apple' where he comes across a priceless work of art ""Blond, smooth skin as white as that milk, of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably the best. It's a masterpiece. The rest of this sh*t is worthless junk."" Fiennes switches between the two so naturally, yet somehow remaining charismatic throughout to create a peculiar and unique character. These characters are mixed with Anderson's distinct visual style to create the beautiful world in which the Grand Budapest is set in. Short of 'Fantastic Mr Fox' this is probably where his directing style comes across strongest, with the film filled with his trademark centred shooting style and panning shots. Mixed with this is his usual charming dialogue and unusual storytelling style. This time Anderson experiments with a unusual narrative spanning 80 years in the first 10 minutes.In the modern day a young girl is reading a book. In this book the author recounts a time when his younger self met the mysterious millionaire Zero Moustafa. Moustafa tells tells of the inter war years when the hotel was at its prime and under the leadership of Gustave H and the adventures that they went on. Through his smooth style the intro feels as if it were plucked from a book through the authors descriptive tone to explain the narrative and Andersons smooth style passing through scenes as if one was turning pages in a book. This narrative also plays a significant role in Andersons visual style, most importantly that of the hotel. Due to the films narrative then there are two designs to the hotel. The first from the 30's where the bulk of the story is set. With this the hotel is a grand design, with stunning hallways constantly crowded with the wealthiest individuals, impeccable service and with brightly coloured cinematography to emphasise the beauty. It is nothing short of an ideal hotel, creating an illusion full of life and happiness.The second design is from the 60's where in contrast the hotel is aged after the war. The halls are no longer crowded. Service is lazy at best. The bright colours are less defined. And it is no longer full of life as it once was. Whether it is to demonstrate how the war has destroyed the beauty of the hotel or to serve as a reminder of how the heyday of the Grand Budapest will be remembered for generations to come, Anderson uses the visuals of the hotel to give greater meaning and weight to Gustaves story. It makes the life seem all the more beautiful then and makes us desire even more to experience it. And that's what makes the film truly special. Anderson not only creates his unique image of a world but makes us want to be a part of it. Whether it's the charm of Gustave and every other character or the Grand Budapest itself, Anderson hypnotises us to the screen through the films charm and beauty. It's certainly a film that I'll want to revisit time and time again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 August 2014,2/10,"Bottle Rocket, Wes Anderson's debut film, was a comic delight. Since then, most of his films have left me unimpressed or disappointed. He has resorted to quirkiness and deadpan dialog increasingly. While I found ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" at least watchable, as was ""Rushmore"", (though neither worth recommending), ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and now ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" are examples of a director who is so consumed with his style, that the story takes a back seat. All the dialog sounds like it came from the same person. As others have noted, like the naked emperor, Anderson wants you to notice how cute he can be, with centered shots that have characters emerging from a hole one at a time from each of four 90 degree angles. Ha Ha Ha! But despite this being a comedy of sorts, laughs from the audience I was in were few and far between. I gave the film 2 stars, mainly because the sets were so pretty to look at, but like this film and Moonrise Kingdom, they were simply facades, with little substance beyond the surface appearance."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 June 2014,7/10,"There is a major degree of uniqueness with exotic visuals in the presentation of this movie. Makeup and costumes were way too fine. Tilda's makeup as an old woman was my favorite. There are loads of black humor. The cast is rich with big names ( such as William Dafoe, Adrian Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Murray Abby etc) and Ralph Fiennes owned the movie show. He was fine with comedy and most of the part he reminded me of Steve Martin from Pink Panther.The negatives: The major problem that any non -European (like me) would face watching the movie is the sarcasm-comedy which are traditional French or Italian mostly. Few explicit comic scenes deserved laughs but others were rotten. The music could've been better.The movie-theme reminded me of the Grand Hotel movie in 1931."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2016,3/10,...by 'fascists'? The film was interesting at first but it slowly oozed into a mess due to a poor script that stilted any energy in the story. It wanted so much to be a adult version of say 'Alice In Wonderland' but the choice of roles and the numerous cameos (concierges) added to the repetitive poor attempt at humor. Nothing really dark here more of a boring tale that left the talent of a great ensemble elsewhere.The director gave us an 'All Star Team' of the Americans vs. the Euros (heavily stroked with de rigueur 'Brits').Do what I did - go to your local public library and borrow it - a loss of 90 minutes with a cutesy plot that goes no where.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 October 2021,8/10,"You know when you're watching a Wes Anderson film, the symmetry, the style, the script, the music. Needless to say Wes Anderson has a unique voice in the industry, however, The Grand Budapest Hotel, at least to me, epitomises the Wes Anderson style bringing together aspects from every film he's ever made, the use of different aspect ratios, stop motion, the whimsy of the characters, train rides, love. Wes Anderson here brings everything he's ever done together into one film that feels so utterly Anderson that it is insane. I loved the story and thought it was a fun encapsulation of a certain period and place in time but really the only thing to say is that if you don't enjoy films by Wes Anderson you won't get much from this, however, if you've enjoyed his films before you'll be getting more of the same but bigger and crazier than ever. 8/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 January 2015,8/10,"We've seen movies about hotels - beginning from the distant thirty years, and getting to one of the titles of Tarantino. But I must admit, a film about the hotel dedicated to the writer I had not come across until now.Dynamic, humorous, theatrical, fantastic. The plot is about the history of a building, which embodies the history of the 20th century. Actually, these are hard times affecting all of us; that shaped modernity. ""The past is not over, in fact is not past at all"", who said that? Film that shows when high manners are in place. Namely, when they are from kindhearted and benevolent people. When politeness is a manifestation of humanity, and we are all people, but we are not all polite. On a pedestal were elevated loyalty and long lasting friendship. Below all this, there are the small details that are the glue of our society. Their presence is not a question of luxury, it is an indicator of a highly developed culture. Alas, their disappearance shows only savagery.A polite criticism of the worst part of human nature, served delicate and serene. Film like that, from the past year (let us remember - century passed since the beginning of the First World War) is a great achievement. Resembles the films inspired by the writings of Agatha Christie and The Artist.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,6/10,"Having only seen one movie by Wes Anderson before (Moonrise Kingdom), it was difficult to predict what to expect from The Grand Budapest Hotel. Moonrise Kingdom isn't a good movie, despite all the good reviews it got: in fact, it's quite boring, style-over-substance-ish, and counts on people liking it because the main characters are ""sweet innocent kids"". TGBH, on the other hand, looked promising – interesting, featuring an awesome cast, funny jokes and an actual story and events you can follow. And after all, Wes Anderson is considered a good director, whose movies, including this one, gained mostly positive reviews. Unfortunately, Mr Anderson will be Mr Anderson, and TGBH is yet just another style-over-substance flick.The movie starts with a girl, reading a book titled The Grand Budapest Hotel, next to its writer's bust. It then switches to the old writer (Tom Wilkinson), that starts recalling the events that led to writing the book. We then see the young writer (Jude Law), staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel and meeting its owner, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who decides to tell him the story of how he became the owner of the hotel. As a teenager, Mr. Moustafa was known as Zero (Tony Revolori) and worked as a lobby boy in the same hotel he owns. The legendary concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) becomes his mentor and best friend, and together they embark on strange and dangerous adventures.Despite being pointless and strange (since the characters of the old writer and the girl reading his book appear again, briefly, only at the end of the movie), this kind of beginning has its charm, and nicely introduces the whole story. The setting in general is wonderful: the costumes, the outdoors and indoors, the colors and all the playing with shadows and light make TGBH a truly beautiful movie, that's impossible to watch without wanting to be sucked into its world. Another great movie quality is represented by its cast of famous and excellent actors, who, luckily, don't condemn TGBH to the fate many other movies with good casts had recently (The Counselor, Movie 43). And even the less known actors, like for example Tony Revolori, are good.Probably the movie's biggest issue is that it can't decide whether it wants to be serious or silly. Both aspects work fine when seen alone, but put together, they just make the movie confusing – especially considering the background story is one of war and totalitarianism. One may argue that life is like that, a combination of seriousness and silliness, but that again doesn't fit the surrealistic vibe of the movie. There are also a lot of jokes that fall flat – if they are, in fact, jokes, which I suppose they are since some members of the audience in my theater were laughing hard at them. Ultimately, the story exists, but it feels like it would be the same if there was nothing going on: again, too much style, too little substance. TGBH definitely had potential, but ended up being an empty, cold and distant, although visually stunning, movie.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2020,8/10,Wes Anderson made great picture and of curse that was Ralph Fiennes' Best Performance. I enjoyed of the story that was very good one and I always like the way a narrator narrate the story. and of curse it was quite an Adventure. 99 minutes movie with great dialogs and I liked almost every single line of it.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 June 2019,9/10,"The story of a hotel manager and his lobby boy told through the mystery of a terrible murder, with an excellent touch of comedy, absurdity and above all, Anderson.Those who are related to Wes Anderson's work know that they are for a special movie, and let me tell you that it is completely. No film can be compared to such an exceptionally original work. Wes' direction is something that already stands out without needing to mention it, he knows how to direct like no one else, his style is simply impeccable and he has been given a special place in the history of cinema.This film is no exception to his style, but it is one of his best examples. Manufactured in a detailed and unique way, with an excellent atmosphere unique to find, a wonderful style reminiscent of a play. The performances are magnificent, incredible and fun; it is a comedy with a slight criminal and mysterious touch, full of fun and unique moments that undoubtedly make this film deserves a special place. The relationship between the protagonists is something fantastic and wonderful to observe through the development of the plot, never boring and always keep us emotionally attached to them, something I must highlight is that, the film will move us completely with a unique narrative and a special ending.A fantastic film, a comic tragedy with a style impossible to plagiarize."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 March 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is art in motion, inspired by the Silent Era of film. Director Wes Anderson presents us an adventure where Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) tries to prove his innocence of a murder with the help of his employee, simply named Zero (Tony Revolori). While the story lacks focus at times, the movie remains entertaining through its quirky, witty humor and the growing relationship between Gustave and Zero. This is a visual spectacle to be seen on the big screen. Truly.The Grand Budapest Hotel stars Ralph Fiennes, popularly known for portraying ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,"" playing a completely different character that I will name, Monsieur Gustave. A devoted concierge of the hotel, Gustave is shallow, selfish, and takes advantage of vulnerable older women for his pleasure. The other major character is Zero, a refugee without a family, looking for a place to fit in. He is played by a newcomer to cinema, Tony Revolori. After a murder of a previous ""lover,"" Gustave is falsely framed for her death. This thrust him and his apprentice lobby boy, Zero into an adventure trying to prove his innocence. To start with, in terms of story it felt a bit weak, losing focus at times to show events that never end up affecting the overall arc or characters. However, the backbone that keeps this movie interesting through all the shenanigans is the growth the two main characters go through together. Blended with the quirky banter and dark humor, the relationship between the two is very well written and a joy to watch.There is no way one can watch a Wes Anderson directed movie and not talk about his visual style. His previous films are distinctively unique, and this movie is no different. I personally loved the visuals of The Grand Budapest Hotel. So much so that I feel each frame of the movie could have been hung up on a wall as art, and each of them would tell their own story. Everything in the scenes you see are placed there with a purpose, even down to the way glasses are placed on a table. Anderson does something beautiful where he brings life into static shots of a room or scenery, through the movement and caricatures of the actors. The movie in general gives homage to the Silent Era films, likes of Georges Méliès. This is clearly apparent from the aspect ratio, to the exaggerated acting, and to the bright colors imitating the hand-colored film of that era.I have to admit I really enjoyed the movie, more than I thought I would. There is no denying that Anderson's movies are very divisive, people either really like them or don't. I can say without a doubt that The Grand Budapest Hotel will not turn you into a Wes Anderson fan if you are not already. Still, the ones who are a fan will find plenty to love about this film, and for those this a must see."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 November 2020,10/10,"What an incredibly pleasant film. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those movies that just keeps on giving. It's as gorgeous and funny as it is heartfelt and lovely. As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything that I would've changed or liked to have had differently. I think that that's a pretty good indication of just how good this film is.I think that the most obvious thing about this movie is the visuals. Every scene, every set-piece and every shot is just magnificent. The movie is grand and colourful just as much as it's cosy and warm. Indeed I can't quite describe the feeling this movie gave me. But certainly, I was happy and grinning like an idiot for the entire run time.Then I need to talk about the cast. Like the movie as a whole, it just keeps on giving. As the film gets going I couldn't believe how many stars were in this cast. They were all introduced in great ways and I just kept laughing as more and more of them were revealed. For me, the stand out was Ralph Fiennes. He captured the mood of the film so perfectly that it felt like he was born for this role.Although I separated these two aspects of the movie, they are just parts of an incredible sum. Everything in this movie is just sublime. And when you combine all those sublime parts you end up with this masterpiece known as The Grand Budapest Hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 July 2014,10/10,"I have not seen all of Wes Anderson films, but what I have seen I like. I have not seen every picture in the museums of Europe and New York, but of the ones I have seen I know which ones I like. I liked this film very much; I like it better than any film I have seen this year. It is visually pleasing, the actors are familiar and magnificent and the story was timeless and incredibly human. It is an original work of art that uses humor to convey the realities of human behavior, including greed, lust, love, brutality and the idea that life, in the end, can be what we make it. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and others will keep you entertained while Anderson spins this historical fairy tale. This film might not be for everyone but as Anderson says, you can tell he gets it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2020,7/10,"Wes Anderson's films are a bit of an acquired taste for sure, with his quirky characters, wide shots and pastel colours, and this is absolutely bonkers to the highest degree... but it also has buckets of charm. Ralph Fiennes puts in a phenomenal performance, and the film is utterly bursting with big names that sadly each only have minimal screentime. Willem Dafoe was brilliant as the psychopathic antagonist, and Jeff Goldblum was, well... Jeff Goldblum - but the film just feels like it's missing something I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps it's the somewhat unsatisfying ending, or maybe it's the fact the humour doesn't always hit the mark... in any case it's an interesting and entertaining watch that fans of Wes shouldn't miss"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 April 2015,10/10,"Grand BUDAPEST Hotel, Berlin, Friday February 7, 2014. The big opening film of the 64th Berlin Film Festival was the world premiere of the much ballyhooed ""GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL"" which has nothing to do with Budapest or Hungary but is set in a mythical European country that could be Hungary, (with some Polish Signs) and is populated with a prestige all star cast: Ralph Fiennes as a hotel concierge in a thirties full buttons outfit like Johnny the bellhop who used to sail through the Philip Morris hotel lobby shouting ""call for Phil-lipp Maw-aw-rey"", Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, and a staggering lineup of other names Adrien Brody (The Pianist), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, F. Murray Abraham (remember him from Amadeus, 1984?) — plus French stars Mathieu Amalric and Léa Seydoux — wow! How'd he get 'em all to sign up? Directed by Wes Anderson who can be counted on for absurd comical romps and is a favored son of this festival with previous entries such as ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" (the biggest bore of 2004) and ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" starring an obviously disgruntled Gene HackmanGBH was far more fun than I expected it to be judging from certain mixed opinions that have come my way. I would play it as a double feature with Kubrick's ""The Shining"" for the contrastive use of an old Grand Hotel settings and for opposite cinematic purposes --- Fear and Fun! And then throw in the old Greta Garbo Grand Hotel itself... Director Wes Anderson who is no newcomer to the Berlinale, has marshaled every visual technique in the book to come up with a piece of Visual Vaudeville that is really lots of fun if not exactly too coherent -- but then why should an all-star Variety Show-- which is exactly what Budapest Hoteĺ is -- be anything but flippy and fun?Part of the fun is trying to identify extremely well known actors in makeup and disguises so extravagant that it makes them well nigh unrecognizable: Harvey Keitel with a shaved head and naked torso covered with funny little tattoos, Jeff Goldbloom dressed up in a wig and high collar tweeds totally away from his usual image -- only the voice gives him away - -Polanski's Pianist Oscar laureate Adrien Brody so disguised that even his prominent proboscis goes unnoticed -- on and on to the point where the viewer keeps asking him- her-who-self; ""Hey - wait a second -- wasn't that .... ?? -- altogether an hilarious off- season Halloween party and an easy sit through if not quite the most coherent motion picture of all time. On stage introducing the pic tall comedian Bill Murray in a long black coat topped off with some kind of boxy black hat, and a regular presence in Wes Anderson pictures, told the Friedrich Palast audience categorically, in patented Murrayesque manner, ""This is the best picture Wes has ever made. Don't even bother looking at the other competition Pictures -- This one is it!""Wes Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is indeed one of the 23 entries competing for the prestigious Berlin Golden Bear award at the end of the fully packed ten days coming up. Whether Mr. Murray's broad statement turns out to be a fulfilled prophecy is an open question -- but nobody can deny that everybody had lots of fun tonight, and the Sixty- Fourth Berlin Film Festival is off and running ~~ Fasten your seat belts and enjoooooy! -- or else!PS: The grand opener, Wes Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" was awarded the so called ""Grand Jury Prize"" which seems to be some kind of special recognition (booby prize?) for a film that should have won the Golden Bear Best Film award but was too good for its own good at this politically inclined festival which prefers to recognize obscure films from the Twilight Zones of the inscrutable East whenever possible.The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.Ps: Żubrowka is the name of a popular brand if Polish Vodk"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 November 2021,8/10,"Wes Anderson is one of the most original visionaries working in Hollywood, and this film is an amazing reflection of it. It feels like the films of Tim Burton, where the reality mixes with fantasy, but instead of the dark gothic style, the world looks like Barbieland. It also reminds of the silent era of filmmaking with its editing and screenplay. Ralph Fiennes is absolutely delightful in this film, who is equal parts good and vain. So many great cameos with Willem Dafoe standing out. This one showcases how films can be magical."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,9/10,"I expected to enjoy ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" because Wes Anderson is a filmmaker who is generally considered ""an acquired taste"", and I have quite simply acquired it.I did not expect, however, to love the film as much as I did. Ralph Fiennes gives an incredible performance at the centre of this movie. What inspired casting. I really hope he becomes a regular in Anderson's stable of actors, because he takes this movie and runs with it with seemingly no effort. M. Gustave is just a fantastic, fascinating character. The rest of the cast, as you would expect, is quite solid, but make no mistake this is Fiennes' vehicle and he drives this one straight to pay- dirt.Of course, with Anderson, you can expect a certain level of fairy-tale quirkiness and a set-design and sense of colour that is virtually un- matched in this day and age. ""LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU"" has stood tall for many years as my favourite of Anderson's works, but i think that in ""GRAND BUDAPEST"" we may FINALLY have a challenger to the throne.."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 February 2015,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has many dark depressing themes under its colorfully cute and fun moments. With a variety of characters and a peculiar script Wes Anderson is able to grab your attention from the very first minute. The story is set in fictional country of Zubrowka in 1930s. We hear the tale of how Zero Mustafa (Toni Revolori) the lobby boy of the prestigious 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' ends up becoming the owner of the same. He becomes a good friend of the hotel's concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). But things take a turn when someone close to M. Gustave dies and he is arrested suspecting of murder. Zero and Gustave embark on a journey to prove the innocence of M. Gustave where they become even closer friends. Ralph Fiennes has given a fine performance and definitely one of the most under-rated actors. We also have Edward Norton in a relatively smaller role and a exciting Bill Murray cameo as well.Anderson gives intricate and vibrant detailing to the sets making visually beautiful. Also the make-up and hair styling department has done a great job. The music and background score is wonderful. With a run time of 100 minutes The Grand Budapest Hotel does not overstay its welcome. It is quirky, weird at the same time entertainingly funny with a heart touching story. Definitely worth a watch.RATING: [4/5]"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 August 2014,10/10,"A visionary director of obvious intelligence has taken a screenplay of gold in hand and created a stunning, literate, lovely motion picture for those of us who seek the intellectually stimulating in cinema choices. When it was announced that the wonderful author Stefan Zweig was the inspiration for this film, we were incredulous but tantalized. Upon experiencing this beautiful motion picture, we were speechless. It was thrilling to see Zweig's spirit embraced, alive on the screen and permeating celluloid. Superbly directed by Anderson with characters brought to life by a cast of great actors, especially Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham ( a delight to see Abraham indeed!), the proceedings are amazingly Stefan Zweig cinematically realized at times. The wit, the quirkiness, the satire is all there, yet the dark cloud of future totalitarianism casts a shadow across laughing faces as a portent of things to come. The tragic cataclysm of fascism in 1930's Europe is seldom far from our thoughts as we watch the incredibly photographed, fairytale landscapes before us. This is simply a wondrously made movie, set in a mythical country that is virtually Oz-like in appearance. The humor is broad and almost slapstick in sequences but there is something much darker beneath all of it and a certain overall uneasiness experienced by audiences. Without doubt one of the very, very few films of the last decade that truly deserves our unreserved acclaim. It is certainly director Anderson's most accomplished and meaningful work and our admiration for him is now quite intense, to be sure. He has honored Stefan Zweig most appropriately and deliciously, surely inspiring a renewed appreciation and even rediscovery of Zweig and that is the real triumph of this quite intellectual piece of cinema magic."

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 June 2014,3/10,"Third film I see from Mister Anderson... (wait for it... Anderson!!! - sorry, couldn't resist.) Anyway, third film I see and second confirmation that the writer/director has nothing to say and no story to tell.Still, if you like his previous works, you may enjoy this one as well. Which I didn't either. To his credit, he has perfected his visual technique, and produced a lot of appealing pictures. Unfortunately, that's all there is to see. It plays out as a long succession of vignettes, of stills, some of them very much like Flamish paintings. And the initial appeal gets old pretty quickly. It's not so much a film as it is a slide-show. Or at times a cartoon. Not a funny one; the cartoonish scenes, like the snow chase, are plain ridiculous.Maybe, just maybe, Wes Anderson works hard to emulate some talented directors he likes, but without the flair and a decent writer. I must however commend his insistence in treating the mundane and the ugly in the most aesthetic manner. Even desperate cases like Owen Wilson.Definitely not my cup of tea. I'll watch another of his directorial efforts one day, but I'll wait for one that he doesn't write himself."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 March 2014,9/10,"For me, it needs two viewings to fully appreciate it. Maybe I was too tired and too preoccupied in the first show. The second viewing helps me appreciate the picture much much more. It is like a very tightly-knit symphony. Every note, every frame, every line is carefully crafted and precisely shot. Perhaps with a background in advertising, director Wes Anderson is very conscious of his airtime. Watching this film turns out to be a very rich movie viewing experience – visually and graphically, in background music and of course the animation-like exaggerating acting. But the most important is the positive message on humanity. What a pleasure to watch. Maybe the fast pace, long dialogues plus reading the subtitles made it hard to follow the first time. In the second viewing I focused on listening to the dialogue while watching the facial expressions and noticed the precise moment when the music entered. I also appreciate more the overall presentation and organization of the plot and the script which you'd better experience it yourself.The swift mood of the whole movie has a style that resembles Charlie Chaplin's movies, as if it is running slightly on fast speed. Even the love/respect for the ordinary people are also comparable. The loud color scheme, the bold use of red and the spacious portrayal of a huge hotel remind me a little bit of Stanley Kubrick's classic Shining, except this one is a comedy with a warm and humanistic respect for the profession of the concierge.The whole layout of the movie is like a set of Russian dolls where we open one layer of story and find more layers inside but there is a thread linking them throughout. Here we have four layers in total that goes back to a century. Starting from the beginning, we see a young woman carrying a book entitled ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" when she visited the grave of the author. Facing the audience, the author (Tom Wilkinson) tells us what he writes is always based on true events. Going back to his younger days in the 60s when he (Jude Law) spent a month at the hotel, he bumped into the owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) of the hotel, a very rich man who once worked there as a lobby boy (Tony Revolori). And here the core of the story begins.An immigrant escaping war from his country, lobby boy Zero started his training by the popular and legendary concierge Mr. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) in the 1930s. A devoted and professional concierge, Mr. Gustave inherited a valuable painting from one of his rich clients (Tilda Swinton) after she died. When Mr. Gustave and Zero went to her house for the service, a whole series of accusation, arrest, trial and chase begins. The story is not hard to follow but be sure you are alert because the editing is so precise that you need to be very attentive and literally cannot blink/slip too often. Watching the various stars, including Adrian Brody, Mathieu Amalric, Owen Wilson, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux, Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel, a few of them Oscar winners, is such a pleasure. None of them except Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori have a lot of screen time but all of them are impressive with their limited exposure. The animation tone throughout the movie makes it look almost like a cartoon played by human and it is really fun. It was not until I watched the second time that I realized many details have already been planted in the early part of the movie. It is just overwhelming in the first viewing because the dialogue is fast and long, the tempo swift and editing sharp. So many senses have to be employed at the same time that I was just too busy to merely follow, let alone appreciate the production.Similar with the Russian dolls where the same pattern stays throughout different layers, the theme of anti-war, bonding among the professionals and passing on the heritage of humanity (take over) across nationality linger on for years. Even the end credits is a breeze to watch with the exciting balalaika playing and a little animated Russian guy dancing. Totally enjoyable. Highly recommended."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2021,9/10,Anderson is typically more miss than hit for me but I really enjoyed this one. Very funny and my enjoyment was likely due in no small part to Ralph Fiennes being terrific as always.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 February 2014,,"Wes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today. None of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 June 2019,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a unique movie. Its artistically shot, almost looks like a Cadbury's advert, the cast is breathtaking despite the short appearances of some and the script, simply genius. Its by far one of the funniest movies Ive watched this year, which is helped by quite brilliant relationship between Zero and Gustave. At times it feels like its been edited to look like a silent movie and the grandness and colour is used effectively to be so pleasing on the eye creating a sense of wonder about this odd story. It is a strange movie but will be enjoyed by all."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 September 2014,7/10,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Building on the success of Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel marks the recovery of Wes Anderson's directorial career. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, The Darjeeling Limited and Fantastic Mr. Fox were all commercial failures, but now he can be confident in the backing or producers and Hollywood money men to give him the artistic freedom a creative talent like him needs.The reason for the renewal is difficult to pin down. The brilliant cast certainly helps: a whole parade of famous names and faces, such as Adrien Brody and Harvey Keitel. Anderson has always had a talent for convincing stars to join him despite his very modest budget, but he has really outdone himself this time.Ralph Fiennes is a big factor in the central role. Until now, he has generally been thought of as a very serious actor, with gravitas and dignity aplenty, but GBH shows that he has also mastered the art of comic timing. His delivery of comedic lines is brilliant, as are his movements and gestures, playing on his his perceived seriousness to hilariously ridiculous effect.Anderson has always used obvious directorial flourishes and camera movements that deliberately draw attention to themselves, like the exaggerated movements of a mime or clown, but in this film it is taken to extremes. The models used for the exterior of the hotel and its environs are very obviously model-like. Not only is no attempt made to disguise this, it is actually gleefully emphasized. So prominent is Anderson's directorial presence that he is almost a character in the story.There is one very slight blemish: why does Anderson use a different star actress in every film? So many of the male actors return again and again, but not the women. Is there something about working with Anderson that puts them off? It's barely a mystery though, more of a curiosity, and judging by what we see on screen, they seem to be enjoying themselves as much as anyone.A key part of Wes Anderson's attraction to viewers is that he and his collaborators are obviously having tremendous fun, and they bring us along for the ride. His most successful films are the ones that convey that sense of fun best. I look forward to enjoying more from him in future.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2019,7/10,"Well, 4 Oscars. You are kidding me, huh! But yes, it has got. Ask them about Psycho? It got 4 nominations. Oscars can be a bit baffling at times. Anyways, not a bad movie. Indeed a good one. But can never be a great without that Oscar tag. Sadly, there was no chance of Ralph Fiennes grabbing an Oscar as his role was not of an protagonist or a supporting cast. It was good all the way. But, never ever a great movie as has been portrayed. An honest opinion.So not wasting much of a webpage."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 January 2019,10/10,"A masterpiece of a film that is striking in every sense. Memorable characters, a delightful plot and most impressively, it is absolutely gorgeous of a film. Grand Budapest Hotel contains everything a movie lover can ask for. It's visual and pace is distinctively Wes Anderson while paying homage to films from the past. It has a sense of mystery found in movies from 60s and 70s, complete with delightful foreign names and a quirky mystery. Despite all this, there is also something so pure and true behind the film, it tells the story and journey of men. While not always glamorous, these special men remains loyal to themselves and their beliefs, and this is what coats the entire movie into the masterpiece that it is. A special movie that can be seen as the masterpiece of one of the most imaginative director of our time, Grand Budapest will also live in my memory for a long time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 March 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson, like the Coens and Spike Jonze among others, operates on what might be termed 'magical realism', a quirky and odd style that is very un-American but which is familiar to European audiences. After 2012's charming Disney-esque children's film ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Anderson has returned to his former form with a strange little tale filled with sex (light) violence (occasional but nasty) swearing (lots) and black humour (plentiful) The marketing for this film makes it appear a jolly gay comedy romp, and to some extent it is, but there is also a darker side, a melancholy that comes with the death of a golden age and the sufferings of Eastern Europe under the twin evils of Fascism and Communism, mostly captured in the historical bookends featuring a writer inspired by the Austrian satirist Stefan Zweig (whose tales also inspired this movie) It is also a film about how stories are passed down from one to the other, inspiring new hearts each time (rather like ""Cloud Atlas"")Set in a fantasy Ruritanian country called Zubrowka (which is clearly either Hungary or Czechoslovakia) it begins and ends with a girl student in present day Zubrowka admiring a statue of a great national writer whose 1985 book ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" she is reading. We see him in '85 as a mature man (Tom Wilkinson) recounting how he came to know this story as a young man (Jude Law) staying at the decrepit ruin of the once magnificent hotel for his health. Here he meets the owner, the legendary Arab Zero Mustafa (F.Murray Abraham) who is now an impoverished and lonely man. Over dinner her recounts the tale that begins in 1932 when he was a young immigrant lobby boy at the then splendid old GBH under the tutelage of Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) a camp prissy bisexual concierge who is noted for his success with the older ladies that frequent it, something he does for money and prospects but also for pleasure, enjoying the company of these Grande dames from a bygone era of Imperial splendour. One such lady, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in body foam) becomes nervous and shortly after returning home is murdered. In her will she bequeaths him her most prized possession, the Dutch old school masterpiece ""Boy with Apple"" much to the chagrin of her brutish and estranged son Dmitri (Adrian Brody) and his psychopathic henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe), both members of the burgeoning Nazi movement (or ""ZZ fraternity"" here) that is straining to take power and achieve 'Anschluss"" with its larger neighbour. Egged on by the butler Serge X (Mathieu Almariac) he and Mustafa steal the painting, unaware Serge has hidden a copy of Madame D's secret last will in the back, one which would make them a lot of money and lose Dmitiri everything. Framed for the murder and imprisoned, Gustave gets help from Mustafa and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) the pretty baker's girl for the legendary Mendels patisserie and his newfound paramour as well as group of cons led by Ludwig (Harvey Keitel) to escape and prove his innocence, pursued doggedly by both Jopling, who is murdering his way through all the leads to get to Serge and by sympathetic police inspector Henckels (Edward Norton) who as a boy was a fond friend of Gustave's during his families summer vacations at the GHB. After much chasing, fighting, shooting, running, hanging out of windows and ledges, disguises and other 'man on the run' tropes, the heroes win.or do they? As this pulp thriller caper was going on, history was turning and the Nazi's have taken power, and to their cost they find that the old imperial splendour and everything it represented has truly gone forever!The look of the film is of course wonderful, with a deliberately artificial candy coloured dreamland version of inter-war Eastern Europe that the Swastika and The Hammer and Sickle eventually crush into drab grey conformity and gloom, complete with cardboard models and sets straight from the German Expressionist movement. The all-star cast on that big poster are good, though some like Bill Murray (another concierge who lends a hand) Own Wilson (another concierge) Lea Seydoux (Madame D's maid) Jason Schwartzman (1985 concierge) and even Wilkinson to an extent are just glorified cameos. The star of the film is Fiennes, a serious actor with a love for comedy who creates a unique and fun spin on his signature foppish persona that's like a gay, self-absorbed gigolo version of Steed from ""The Avengers"". Newcomer Tony Revolori makes a good straight man to this comic buffoon as young Mustafa, while Ronan plays an unusually normal and sweet girl for once. Brody makes for a hateable heavy while Defoe returns to his roots as the 'gorilla' who is genuinely menacing and frightening and gets an appropriately spectacular send off. Keitel is funny and tough in a small but important role, and Jeff Goldblum plays the family lawyer who plays both sides to his cost. Being at heart a sort of Daschle Hammett pulp thriller there are also lots of un-Andersonesque action sequences including a crazy speed of light downhill ski chase (done with models no less) and a final firefight battle inside the GHB between Dmitri's ZZ henchman and Henckle's police. Many have complained about the sombre ending, but that is I suppose the whole point of the story and it is telegraphed from the very start if you look close enough. Still, the 'comic pulp noir Ruritanian' tale at its heart is fun and entertaining if it is mirth and levity alone you seek.PS – Stick around for the animated Cossack who appears dancing to the catchy Balalaika theme during the end credits (3-4 minutes in)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 October 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel﻿... is one the best films that I have seen this year, so far. Wes Anderson﻿ has delectably concocted an adventurous, mystery with the touch of melancholy in its unfurling; quite reminiscent of the signature style of yet another of my favourite author, Mr. Ruskin Bond﻿.Based on the writings of Stefan Zweig﻿, the plot line is given a modern-day folk lore kind of prestige where its passed from 2 different aged people subsequently who surprisingly, but convincingly manage to preserve the authenticity and truthfulness in its journey that talks about - faithfulness, love, determination, passion, poetry, friendship, murder, fiendishness and hope. Still - all could not be won by men, and this case was no different. A lot was achieved, but in further course somethings precious were lost; as if the history of mankind was speaking of its own course.Ralph Fiennes﻿ and Tony Revolori﻿ - are the ""Jai and Veeru"" of this story(only viewers of Hindi Films would relate to this one), though in very different times and ways. Brilliant bromance! The supporting cast, though brief, was adequately impactful.However, the film did try packing it too much in too short a span; which may seem sort of a waste to some at its culmination however, further adds to the feeling of loss and sombre nostalgia of yesteryear and the current times, as well. Undoubtedly, a film to be seen and cherished! Verdict - ""One of the best one-and-a-half-hours spent"" Viewer's Rating - 8.5/10 Critique's Rating - 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 August 2020,9/10,"Personally The Grand Budapest Hotel is the first Wes Anderson film i see, and i fell in love with it, and I'm definitely going to see more Wes Anderson films in the future, from the cinematography, color palette, and dialogue The Grand Budapest Hotel is truly fantastic, it made me laugh many times and the story is just amazing, the characters were played by the perfect people, specially M."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 March 2014,7/10,"Wes Anderson is generally a film maker you either ""get"" or ""don't get"" ; not getting him does not necessarily reflect the quality of the movie. I fall into the camp who can never quite get on board with him, so it is great praise to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this light soufflé of a movie. There may be argument about a certain emotional distance from the central theme, or that the film is ultimately less consequential than it should be; in the background of this caper is a looming fascism; the lightness seems at odds with the potential drama of the original writings from which the film takes inspiration. There is also a certain lack of development of characters, although something about the tone allows for this; in any case, it is made up for, to some extent, by the fact that the thing is rammed full of mostly welcome cameos, clearly having a lot of fun with the little moments they have. In another work this may have proved distracting, but in fact here it seems to enhance the enjoyment of events. It is a fresh, offbeat, well designed and choreographed piece; the storybook flourishes, the wonderfully vibrant dialogue, sets designed to withing an inch of life, camera moves and cinematography make the whole thing very sweet and amusing to behold, and this is without mentioning rather splendid, comical central turn from Ralph Fiennes.So, to use an appropriate analogy, I found it to be like admiring a really well baked and decorated wedding cake, with all the clever, beautiful trimmings, but when taking a bite, finding there's an ingredient you're not particularly keen on. It doesn't take away from how much you admire the work that went into it, but you can't say you enjoyed it as much as everyone else seems to have done. All credit to Anderson for creating what is clearly a smart and audacious work of art, and it is with this in mind I rate it as highly as I do, but would I watch it again? Perhaps once, to see what I missed, but after that, I don't think so. Many would, though, and I can't ignore that fact."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson's Lumpen HotelWes Anderson's new film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a testament to the yearnings of the lumpen proletariat in the fictitious town of Zubrowka in Eastern Europe before WWI. Mr. Gustave, the hotel's long-time concierge gets ahead in the world by pleasing the bourgeois guests of the famous hotel, anticipating their every need. He teaches his right-hand man, Zero the lobby boy, the ways of the world. Their goal is to satisfy the upper crust, and thus, advance in the world that has little in it for them otherwise. The relationship between Gustave and Zero is a delightful symbiosis of master and student. While Gustave thinks he is doing Zero a favor, he benefits from their friendship as much as Zero does.The movie is visually stunning, high-class kitsch. And unlike many of Anderson's other films, the plot in Hotel is well drawn out yet not simple. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing; he can act out whole scenes with just his facial twitches. Tony Revolori plays Zero Mustafa as a boy, an innocent who is anything but a dullard, with great aplomb considering it's his first major film. Note: As of this writing, neither IMDb nor Rotten Tomatoes lists Mr. Revolori in the credits for the film. That is strange, since he plays the second most important role in the film. The rest of the cast play their roles to various degrees of success. F. Murray Abraham is especially entertaining playing the melancholy yet satisfied Mustafa as an adult.Boiled down to its essence, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a screwball comedy set in a fictionalized nation not unlike the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup. The jokes are more low key and the dialogue is not as ridiculous in Hotel. And to Anderson's credit, the dialogue in Hotel is not pretentious. We can also thanks Fiennes for delivering his lines with tongue-in-cheek sincerity. And of course, the plot is more clever than Duck Soup without being vainglorious as characterizes some of Anderson's other movies.Rating: Full Price The movie is, nor is Anderson, as groundbreaking as other critics state. We won't think of the film as a ""classic"" in twenty years, but it's a thoroughly entertaining romp that is meant for the large screen.Peace, Tex Shelters"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 June 2014,5/10,"A kind of flashback-inside-a-flashback, where we first get an aged writer (Tom Wilkinson) recalling his younger self (Jude Law) meeting with the important Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham); then, another flashback (this one the movie) of Zero's youth working in the hotel under Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and eventually inheriting it.This is Wes Anderson's usual farce of a 'comedy', where he tries to be amusing or quirky, with a big meaningful cast even in the smallest of roles, colorful visual and 'hip' soundtracks. As usual, this is a matter of 'style': you are either the artsy type who glorifies him as one of modern cinema's finest or, like me, sees him as a pretentious hack.Like in all his previous films, such as 'Rushmore' and 'Moonrise Kingdom', Anderson's style annoys me. He attempts to be 'different' in a sense, trying to force a quirky feel to his movies that only ends up making his characters and plot lines feel forced and unrealistic, almost cartoonish, to the point halfway through the film they might get unbearable. His entire 'trademarks' (character presentation, chapter separation, reaction shots) are interesting ideas, but he tries to be so fancy doing that that it becomes... Cheesy? 'The Grand Hotel Budapest' is no different. The plot develops nicely, but by the end it is so pointlessly complicated it's not even funny. Characters come and go for seconds, so much you have to wonder why cast names like Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Ed Norton or Jude Law for cameo- like minor roles. Just to add to the poster? At least his more irritating casting choices (Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton) also get the same cameo-esque treatment (i.e..: they are almost inexistent in here).Among the actors that get more screen time Ralph Fiennes does a very good job, though his accent distracts a bit. Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan and Willem Dafoe are also good to watch, while Adrien Brody is atrocious as usual; Tony Revolori (the young Zero) is quite inconsistent, though his scenes with Fiennes are usually good.The scenarios are beautiful, that is undeniable. But even that is not enough to compensate for all its shortcomings. Some scenes, like the whole mountain chase, felt like a failed attempt at recreating a Looney Tunes sketch.In other words, this is the same old Wes Anderson formula made slightly more bearable. Fans of his style will get the usual 'fun' they find in it, while anyone else should be free to avoid it. Truth be told, I only watched it because of its unusually high rating."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 September 2015,9/10,"This movie is one of the masterpieces in art films. I often felt the scenes were transpired straightly from strips of drawings. I am fond of black comedies. They are hard to contrive, execute and even more often perceived as tragic nonsenses. Two main characters interacted seamlessly. Articulately ridiculed lines made me laugh consistently. I would like to see an animated version of it. I think it would serve the purpose of humanity. I abhor swear words. I often feel since we are the only specie can use this sophisticated communicating skill. We would rather using it wisely than abusing it. In my view, scripts of this movie are intensively brilliant. Those didn't like it. Mainly because there are not many dramas also short of actions. It is an art film and lines are the essences. Luckily, they are beautifully done."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 January 2015,1/10,"This is a film that deserves zero stars ( one reason being it has one of the biggest wastes of talent in Motion Picture History ( Finnes, Murray, Law etc)). It also reached a stage of Political Correctness that I have never seen before ( the bad guys are Nazi's are they afraid to offend Germans?). It also has the dubious distinction of being one of the very few movies that I do not get the point of (especially the scene in the Hotel with Jeff Goldblum where you have no idea what happens to that character?). Did I forget to mention that it was supposed to be a comedy? It forget to include laughs. Even Satire and 'Chick Flick' Romantic Comedies have at least one laugh. The repeat gag ( about the chocolate) was not funny the first time ( let alone the second). Basically it is awful and unless your brain works in a different way then most of us ( me included), you should avoid. Maybe that is why it was nominated for Oscars ( because Hollyweird does not think like the rest of us). Zero Stars."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 May 2014,8/10,"I love Wes Anderson. There I said it. His films fill me up with some much glee and joy. The man loves film making. He makes stories for film fans. Look at his filmography and you can tell the man must watch hundreds of films a year. He's almost created his own genre. I would say the quirky comic fantasy is his and his alone. I never know when he's going to drop a film but then I get a trailer. I get so excited like a little kid for that new toy release. I was the same way when I saw the first trailer for The Grand Budapest Hotel. The trailer, mainly the cast blew my mind. He always able to get a great cast for his films. And what makes me happy the most is that I saw familiar faces from his other films were going to show up in this film. It was a hilarious trailer that I had to tweet, Facebook and post on Tumblr. The viewing for this movie for me was going to be in a power packed week. I had seen Noah before it and The Winter Soldier after. I should have know this would be a standout. Wes Anderson has once again created a whole world that could be somewhere on earth. His characters are deep and engaging, his direction is fantastic and his actors bring out their best as usual. The story is a wild murder mystery with some eccentric characters on display. This film is the most R-Rated film of his. It's dark, much darker than anything his ever done. And I welcome it. He gets pretty serious, especially when some of the events start to unfold after the initial introduction. There is no main character that doesn't have something tragic happen to them. If I would say anymore it would give too much of the plot. For me The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is my favorite Wes Anderson film and one of my favorite films of all time. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a much darker tone of film than that but no less funny with some serious moments. I was laughing hysterically from beginning to end. There are some classic comic moments that haven't been seen in films in a long time. This harking back to the 70's and 80's days. The entire cast is one point. Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Adrian Brody standing out. And the litany of cameos will make you smile and many times giggle. This film stuck with me for longer than I thought after walking out of the theater. I felt for these characters and would have loved to see more. That's the type of film for me that stands the test of time. I'm not putting this on an all time comic level but The Grand Budapest Hotel is an another excellent outing from a director who has slowly crafted his own universe and genre. There's nothing more I could say other than I haven't laughed this hard in a movie in months."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 July 2014,8/10,"This movie contains most of the typical cast members from Wes Anderson movies and has the same quirky feel that his movies typically contain. The sets are very beautiful, and certain scenes have an almost animated aspect. The movie also has some very funny characters, with Ralph Fiennes absolutely stealing every scene he is on screen. The relative new-comer portraying Zero also does a great job with his many scenes opposite of Ralph Fiennes. The re-occurring poetry scenes were hilarious as well as the Prison scenes. My only minor gripe with the movie was that the flashbacks gave it an uneven pacing. It would have been more effective if it was just set in the past."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 July 2020,8/10,"I like this film. The camerawork and colours are nice, as expected from a Wes Anderson movie, and the extremely styled nature of the movie makes the stilted dialogue and weird characters not feel out of place. That is an issue I have with some of his works. It's fun, give it a go if you are new to his filmography."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2020,8/10,"Like a warm cup of hot cocoa, so sweet but not frivolous, many lines and jokes are intended to point to, but also natural, not stiff. At the end of the film I saw the director's tribute to Zweig, and my tears fell."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 January 2015,8/10,"I saved watching this until I needed to be diverted from the winter weather. Fantastic, just as good as I anticipated it would be. The surrealistic atmosphere, the humour, the stellar cast, the Wes Anderson trademark quirkiness and darkness of the story, all made this memorable. I don't understand why some people who know that they are not fans of Wes Anderson's work have commented that they hated this film. His style is unique and if people don't get it or like it, the best approach would be to avoid it. Wes Anderson's contribution to cinema is legendary and he is one of my firm favourites. It's difficult to choose a specific aspect of this film which stands out, because it is uniformly excellent, and although Ralph Fiennes performance is central, all the performances however small (Bill Murray was a cameo and so were some others) were crucial and contributed to the whole. I have travelled in Eastern Europe and East Germany and some of the locations reminded me fondly of my travels. I have even stayed in ex-communist hotels and the Grand Budapest reminded me of these places. Amazing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 May 2014,9/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" may be director Wes Anderson's most intricately constructed and lushly designed jewel box. But this comedy-drama, set in the decadent glamor of pre-World War II Europe and the murkiness of the Iron Curtain, is also very enjoyable to watch.It's a story within a story within a story. It starts out with an anonymous young woman reading the work of a deceased author, then switches to 1985 as that author (Tom Wilkinson) starts telling his story to the camera.Anderson switches again to 1968, and the author (played in his younger days by Jude Law) is visiting the now-rundown Grand Budapest Hotel in the fictional — and now Communist — central European nation of Zubrowka. There he has dinner with a mysterious old man, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) — and it's his story, starting in 1935, that Anderson is really aiming to tell.The movie rides on the talents of two brilliant performances. One is the newcomer Revolori, who is marvelously deadpan as he observes his mentor Gustave navigate narrow escapes, prison confinement and coach-class accommodations. The other is Fiennes, usually known as a dramatic heavy (as a ruthless Nazi in ""Schindler's List"" or as Lord Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" films) but showing impressive skills here as a nimble comedian.With a rich cast of characters, Anderson creates a fast-moving and funny tale brimming with eccentric touches. He also paints moving portraits of two lost eras, the prewar decadence of European nobility and the gloomy anonymity of the Soviet satellite states, and the dread of the awful history in between. The result is as offbeat as any of Anderson's films, but more heartfelt than most.The plot itself is too complicated to tell, so it's best just to watch the movie on it's own. It's a great blend of almost every genre; it needs to be seen. And just like any other movie, the less you know, the better the experience."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 August 2020,8/10,"The Keystone Kops meet Victor Herbert. All that is needed is for everyone to break out singing every now and then and this would be a great operetta, a melodrama set in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. The single camera technique employed by director Wes Anderson (only moving side-to-side or front-to-back-to front) can become tiresome at times but generally maintains its role as providing a special feeling to this fairy tale. Anderson's style includes what film critic Judith Crist called the ""Hey there..."" technique. She was referring to biblical epics of the 1960s with many famous actors in bit roles. It applies here, for example: ""Hey there, it's Bill Murray!"" or ""Hey there, it's Bob Balaban!"" etc. Another frustration with the film is its fast pace and quick screen shots. There is so much detail in each setting that you want to feast your eyes on the grandeur (as well as visual ""in"" jokes). For that reason, it's best viewed as a DVD so you can back up and watch scenes over and over again"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 July 2014,4/10,"In contrast to other reviewers, I am quite disappointed of this film. It is a rather weak comedy aimed at a British/American audience with limited knowledge of Central Eastern Europe's cultures and languages - and its bare content may therefore appear exotic and hilarious. The whole actually resembles Swedish comedy movies from the 80s, but with modern aesthetics.The weakest link is the script and especially the dialog. The film starts of in an extreme tempo, as fashionable nowadays, probably not to risk boring any potential young and inexperienced viewers, maybe to appear smart and fresh - with the consequence of the audience losing half of what is going on. The extraordinarily many famous actors do not reach anywhere to potential - instead it seems like squeezing in as many stars as possible in roles that do not offer full scope for their talent.The second character, Zero Moustafa, as young played by an Indian-looking (apparently Latino) actor, as old by a white Caucasian (why?), may ring fresh with current political news for a British/American audience as he is a refugee who has had to leave his home country due to war - and due to this fact the constant nonsense-speaking Gustave excuses himself for a ""racist"" remark. And then they run around lightly clad in the snow together for much of the rest of the movie. For me, not finding anything funny, the only joy is the great cinematography, the photo and the music. The whole show is certainly wrapped in luxury paper - it feels like a waste with such weak content. But dollar-wise it might still be a success"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 November 2019,8/10,"Poinless describing the plot as it's surreal. There's visual joy in this movie from the start. Animation, hyper-reality, backdrop, green-screen, cartoon, It hops about in the most delightful way. All the central cast are great -and all play just the right ""tone"" for their character. There's cameos , most of which are fine, except Goldblum who does his ham schtick as usual and is greasy and creepy , as usual. This whole fim is stand-up unique. There's laughs here and, of course, charm. But it's, truly, all shades, done really well."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 June 2014,8/10,"Filmmakers can craft narratives in three realms: Reality, Unreality or Surreality.Take Moonrise Kingdom for example, to delineate the latter two 'alities.'Edward Norton plays a Boy Scout leader who conducts order within his troop in militaristic fashion. The Boy Scouts obviously never organize in this manner, but it's part of the surreal world the director's creating in order to build story.Now. Ed Norton jumping over an impassable expanse with a child in his arms, that's unrealistic. The act can't occur in a relatable world, be it satirical or otherwise.My point is, the director's on his game when he remains within that surrealistic middle ground. In the frilly, multicolored world of luxe poignancy.I'm not Wes Anderson's biggest fan.The Grand Budapest Hotel got shifted to the backburner because most reliable sources have given the thumbs-down.I've seen The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Moonrise Kingdom and they're all good. They're not great, but they're good.And I won't go into my reasons here, but there's always something that keeps them from achieving that next tier.What's the difference?A great movie is worth revisiting. As much as I admire his talent and efforts, Wes Anderson's movies just aren't worth another round for this reviewer.All that being said, TGBH is my favorite so far. It's very good; plenty captivating enough to enjoy the entire movie. And it's not too long, which nowadays, is always good news.Therefore, beware naysayers. As your brother in nay saying, there's nary a nay-say for stating.I'm all too willing to dislike The Grand Budapest, and am delighted just the same.Perhaps Wes's flicks are like a new catcher's mitt; you have to catch a couple stylistic knuckle balls before you're broken in and ready to absorb a fastball.(Cause that's how you break in a catcher's mitt, right?)Here's what works.Not only the casting, but also his stylistic choices (including the abnormal storytelling and complex narrative structure) make for a riveting moving picture.Oftentimes the visuals are simultaneously complex and subtle, with familiar characters peeking into scenes with elaborate scenery and backdrops. The use of various camera angles, cuts and on-screen text all add to the delightful, kaleidoscopic surrealism.The humor's heartier and more consistent than usual. The jokes are oftentimes of a less smirky nature, although the irony hits the right comedic notes as well.The dialogue is excellent, Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave proves rather proficient at executing the humorous manner of speaking. His timing is calculated and understated. Some of the best jokes are the mid-speech exclamations.There are too many big names to mention, but Tony Revolori is solid in his breakout role as Zero.One major nuance I appreciate this time around is the centering of the on screen action within the scene. It seems the main characters are brought to the forefront of the sequence, each event seemingly set in a vacuum, and spotlights are shined on the primary players.Quite literally, the lighting is increased around Jude Law, and he even notices the effect.This in turn adds to the overall feeling of 'storytelling,' because that's indeed the way the characters would interpret it. If Zero were to recall a single memory, such as the moment the train's stopped, the visual depiction of his mental picture may resemble something like Anderson's vision.If this event truly takes place, there'd be the sounds of soldiers searching other train cars surrounding them. The way Zero remembers it includes only the immediate effects it has on him and M. Gustave.Here's the thing, I don't have much bad to say about this movie, because I enjoyed it so thoroughly. It's my third favorite movie to come out so far this year and I'd highly recommend it for any movie lover.Of course I'd tell you to catch Noah and Captain America: The Winter Soldier first.But if you haven't seen any of those three choices, well, then saddle up your movie horse, compadre.Go into The Grand Budeho with low expectations (like me), and there's no way you'll be disappointed, right?It's rated R, how bad could it be?I suppose the only downside's no tears were shed.Especially when the same can't be said for Moonrise Kingdom.I often wonder why he kept Ed Norton's unrealistic leap in that movie.Perhaps its Anderson's nod to the audience; his method of acknowledging the leap he asks the viewer to take in suspending disbelief.Perhaps the obvious use of CGI purposely jars us lose of the fantasy.In which case I say: Good on ya, Wes Andy.Consider me 'broken-in.'"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2015,8/10,"Grand Budapest is really a fun film. Fiennes is at his peak! The movie is funny, interesting. The cinematography is great and pops off the screen.I like the plot, way its told and the setting. Some of my favorite actors are in this and the newer actors are great too. The timeline jumps and the hops in the plot are just right, enhancing the story. I don't know if this is an award winning movie, but very, very well done and the type that doesn't ask for too much investment from you but entertains well."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2016,5/10,"For many film buffs, Wes Anderson is a brilliant director who can do no wrong. For me, his films may be full of technical marvels and are very clever, but for all that, they leave me cold. For many, his films are hilarious. For me, some of his so-called comedic episodes may raise the odd smile but for the most part, his attempts at humour are too calculated and come across as completely lacking spontaneity – the very antithesis of how comedy should appear to be. For many, his films are a rich and rewarding experiences. For me, they lack emotion and passion, and any real drama. One cares not one iota about the fate of the principal players and one sheds not a tear when things go bad.It is all contrived and utterly sterile.I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel. Maybe I am just too old to appreciate this apparent genius of 21st-century cinema, whose latest flick has so far garnered 4 Golden Globe nominations, (best film, best director, best actor, best screenplay), and 10 BAFTA nominations, (best film, best actor, best screenplay, best cinematography and many more).Indeed, I had to trawl through many pages of ten-star user reviews before I found one that said the film 'lacks substance and interesting characters' and another, which was entitled: ""Can I have my money back?""Well, I really wouldn't go that far – not that I pay for my movies anyway.The story is about a concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars that is crumbling and has seen better days, and a lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The theft and recovery of a priceless painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune are at the heart of the actionTo be fair, it was a vaguely amusing movie – very quirky and visually provocative – which sort of held my interest, without in any way drawing me in or making me thirst for more.The two lead actors: Ralph Fiennes as the concierge and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy do more than justice to their roles, as do all the large number of 'name' actors who take on cameo roles – not that I recognised most of themBut the film is a piece of fluff and for some reason it brings to mind that other piece of highly over-rated mediocrity, ""Lost in translation"" which garnered a feast of awards a decade ago.I'm sorry – I get Mike Lee, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Spike lee, Ethan Cohen, Quentin Tarantino and a whole gamut of quirky, off the wall directors, but I really don't get Wes Anderson.Maybe it's just me.So in the interests of fairness, let me conclude this review by reprinting the closing paragraph of the Guardian's review:""What slices the surface is the rapier- sharp wit, with Fiennes on point at all times, a dashing foil for his director's comedic cut and thrust.""There now you know."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 April 2014,8/10,"If you follow the film industry as much as I have, you must surely know about director Wes Anderson. Anderson is a very quirky filmmaker who came into the public eye in the late 90's and then developed a following. His is a type of filmmaking that you either love or hate but either way, it is definitely different compared to what usually comes out of the film.Anderson's newest film is The Grand Budapest Hotel and the most misleading thing about this film is that its not all about this hotel. Sure, the plot centers around the hotel but the story is about an art heist in the 1930's involving characters Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and Zero (Tony Revolori) in the fictional town of the Republic of Zubrowka. The heist leads to deaths, a friendship, a family's fortune and of course the Grand Budapest Hotel.I can't say that I've seen many art heist films because there aren't many of them. The art heist story is quite convoluted and can be on the dull side but it is very smart with depth and the story involves much more than a typical heist. The story contains many elements ranging from black comedy to action/thriller scenes. The movie has a type of depth that can't really be described in full to someone who hasn't seen it.What makes this an even more interesting art heist story is how Anderson's filmmaking style fits into it. He makes this story very quirky and strange; so much so that is a borderline ""art house"" film. It is a type of style that is again hard to describe and frankly it is best when watching this to just go with it. Anderson brings many characters to the story including big name actors like Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson. Yes, it's too many characters to keep track of at times but only Anderson could have gotten together a cast like this and it is very inspiring to see a cast like this in an ""indie type"" film.I don't see The Grand Budapest Hotel as a film that I will be watching very often nor is it close to the type of films I'm normally into but Wes Anderson really makes this film worthwhile. He does so much here to tell the story and make it unfold into something really good and something we could not imagine being so good. The Grand Budapest Hotel is very grand and heartwarming and one of the first different types of films of 2014."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 May 2014,10/10,"A Movie MovieI went to the theater knowing anything about this movie. I loved it since the first scene. This movie is something close to the perfection: each scene, dialogs, music, costume, lights, camera movements, acting, set design are near perfection.Watching this movie other films came to my mind: Terry Gilliam's Brazil, the old comedies of silent movies era, Warner's cartoons... the genre is grotesque ""noir"" farce comedy. Black humor and great acting by unrecognizable talents like Murray Abraham, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton to name a few. To say nothing of the protagonist, Ralph Fiennes (with his nose :)10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 June 2020,9/10,"From the first general shot that the film opens, we realize that Wes Anderson takes great care of the frame, which predominates totally in this work. Each shot is cared to the millimeter, in absolutely the entire film we delight in an absolutely stunning cinematographic frame, perhaps too perfect. The static camera with lateral and panoramic movement predominates in general shots that serve not only to tell the story, but even more, to locate the viewer in the context of the characters. Protagonists that Anderson repeatedly places in a painting within the painting or in a circular vignette, making sure that the attention does not leave what is intended to be shown.
And just as he perfectly handles the framing, Anderson also manages to mix or honor different genres, like musicals, comedy, or even silent movies, making it totally work.
We are probably facing one of the most aesthetic films in recent years. Wes Anderson manages to innovate and achieve a fun story with the great success of the frame, which totally steals the attention with its vibrant colors, bright settings and magic that stands out at all times."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2020,9/10,"The film is a reminder of those bygone times. Those naive yet ignorant, prosperous yet shallow, but rich human times. Like Europe before world war ii, like France and the United States in the 1960s, like Japan during the taisho period, like our brief republic of China and the 1980s. It is the spectacle of a culture in transition from old to new, the fever and dream of history. Although ludicrous and unrealistic, but always see all better than the later era of harsh and cold - in revolution, or creed, or national, or development, or democracy, or consumer, or personality, or liberation of all kinds of banner, pretend or frustrated, or passionate, or serious, or center, or understanding, but his bones was traced to sophisticated and calculating."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 October 2018,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel was robbed of numerous Oscars when it was in my opinion a significantly better film than Birdman. Everything in TGBH is flawless! The cinematography is gorgeous. The script is deeply engaging. The directing evidences such a high level of detail. The makeup and costumes are admiring to glance at. Wes Anderson creates such a beautiful and fanciful story woven between two horrific periods of endless conflict. It is remarkable both as mere entertainment, and for artfully weaving comedy and the futility of war implication in such a satisfying manner. It is enjoyable to watch over and over again. Anderson has created arguably his best film to date!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 May 2014,8/10,"I am not a big fan of Wes Anderson and I haven't really been that impressed with his movies since Rushmore. I kind of thought he was a one trick pony. Maybe I was wrong because I actually enjoyed this one. Say what you want to about him, he is an auteur. He has a definite style all his own and he pulled out all the stops with this movie. I liked how a lot of the set were little models (It's only a model) and you could tell and he wanted you to be able to tell. He's not hiding any of this goofy stuff. There is an outrageous and absurd, but fun sled chase scene. Ralf Fiennes is one of my favorite actor after seeing him in this. He steals the show. He owns his part. It was interesting how they made Tilda Swinton really old. I didn't recognize her at first. Although the many famous actors that Anderson has come and go. I'm not even going to name them. It would be easier to name the actors not n this movie. The Muppets would be proud of the cameos and short parts. It's also incredibly colorful and pretty visual. I would kind of recommend to try to see it in the theater. Just a quick synopsis, it takes place right at the beginning of World War 2 in Budapest at a hotel, (of course) for the most part. It's actually kind of a story within a story within a story. It's about a friendship between a bellboy and a hotel manager who get accused of murdering an old rich guest he's been sleeping with at his hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 December 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's look at a story of Gustav H (Ralph Fiennes) - a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel and a lobby boy Zero Moustafa, who found themselves in a huge scandal between wars. Movie starts in 1985, under a late-Communist town of cemeteries. An old writer (Tom Wilkinson) drives away his grandson and recalls the time in 1968 when his younger self (Jude Law) stayed Grand Budapest Hotel and became friend with its owner, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Moustafa on his behalf tells a story of him working at the Grand Budapest Hotel with its owner Mr. Gustav. He was a man of particular character, loved by rich old ladies who felt a lot younger in his company. This characteristic of him brought a lot loyal customers, I should say, mostly fake blond grannies. Among them was Madame D. who seemingly was in love with hotel owner. The story of Gustav starts with her departure from Grand Budapest willing to take late-lover with her. Shortly after that, he gets a notice about death of this extremely rich lady and Gustav decides to pay her a farewell visit.As it turns out, Madame D. has a huge family of sisters, brothers.and son, who all are fighting for her wealth. Among others, concierge gets some part of it - the most valuable painting A Boy with an Apple. Being disgraced by will of departed, her son Dmitri (Andrien Brody) questions validity of the will and accordingly, Gustav has to steal the painting. This is where the fun starts - heirs hunting over stolen piece of art. This is where Wes delivers haunting dark comedy and plenty of enjoyment.The Grand Budapest Hotel has everything we appreciate in Anderson's works. Most importantly, great visuals and easy to follow fun story. First thing, obvious from very beginning is how stunning everything looks in this film - production design, costumes, cinematography. Last year, Moonrise Kingdom had something we don't often see in contemporary movies and this year, Wes definitely improves any his previous works.This amazing work with colors, designs and decorations brings whole story to another level of enjoyment. It entertains eyes and gets us closer to events happening on the screen. The darker story becomes, the more colorful art direction is. On the paper, the combination of such visuals and screenplay looks quite weird and experimental, however in practice I can not imagine The Grand Budapest Hotel without either of them. It takes place in plenty of different locations, started from Hotel to Mountains and prison in between. Each of them is as spectacular as it is.Anderson, the same time, perfectly deals with storytelling with light, dark and definitely funny humor. It does not disappoint you, even more, it makes you sure that you've got the most engaging and diverting an hour and a half ahead.What I also liked is how quickly everything happens. Movie consists of five chapters and they all play in speed of light. Therefore, it never shows unnecessary layers.Films would not be that perfect without this all-star cast, that includes Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, William Defoe, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Nilson and many others. They all do great job and especially Ralph, who's portrayal of Gustav H. is beyond hilarious. But biggest kudos to Tony Revolori for playing Zero aka the Lobby Boy, who was both funny, sad, interesting and did something new and very good. He in fact co-leads with Fiennes and is no less good than him, if not better.And finally, the music by Alexander Desplat makes all above said a lot better. Desplat, who I think composes one of the best music currently, made another award worthy scores that absolutely is in cosistance with everything director tries to tell.All in all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is the most entertaining movie of this year. Don't hesitate to watch it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 February 2018,,"Grand Budapest is a swift and unique 90 minute experience through the 1930's. 
Wes Andersons directing is fabulous, the camera work is astonishing and the acting throughout brilliant. Ralph Fiennes stands out. Yes, sometimes we just say that there were good performances, but he was simply made for this job. 
Sometimes dark and funny to make you laugh, sometimes captivatingly exciting and sometimes even touching, Grand Budapest Hotel is a great movie. One were you can experience the likable characters, one were you feel like you haven't been seeing this stuff over and over and one were you just want to know what happens next. 2014 had some critically acclaimed films, such as ""Gone Girl"" or ""Boyhood"" but this isn't only my pick for best film o 2014, but also a contender for best movie of the 2010's (although there is tough competition with ""The Hunt"", ""Skyfall"", ""Django Unchained"", ""The Hateful Eight"", ""Inception"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises).Well deserved 9/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2017,10/10,"It's a bit like... going into an antique shop full of toys from your youth. They may be toys, by definition, but they no longer represent toys - kids of today would barely know what to do with them. What they DO represent is nostalgia with a whiff of escapism. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a box of chocolates with grown up flavours. It allows the discerning viewer full access to the world of fantasy and escapism.Wes Anderson does such a stellar job; one almost gets the impression that the film is an, all but forgotten, favourite from the past. It, arguably, verges on blasphemy to make any comparison with other films. Having said that; if Tim Burton and Roy Andersson skilfully were blended together - they may be venturing into Wes Andersson's territory.The Grand Budapest Hotel is, to a great extent, what good film making is about. In the world of film - it is also one of few ""musts"" on the shortlist."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 January 2015,5/10,"Full disclosure: I have sat through two films from Wes Anderson and despised them both. I detested Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums is one of the few films I have ever walked out on. So needless to say that I am fairly immune to his ""charms"" as a filmmaker. It was with great trepidation that I approached The Grand Budapest Hotel - which seemed to have much of the same ingredients that made the first two films unendurable for me. However, I was curious based on all its Oscar nominations and it was on cable, so I did not have to spend extra for it.The story is related to a young writer by the mysterious owner of the hotel and centers on a legendary concierge played by Ralph Fiennes, who particularly specializes in flirting, wooing and bedding rich elderly guests. When one dowager (Tilda Swinton in old age make-up) dies she leaves a priceless painting to Fiennes, which awakens the ire of her extended family (primarily Adrien Brody and his nasty assassin Willem Dafoe). When it turns out Swinton was murdered, the family attempt to frame Fiennes, who sets out to prove his innocence with the help of naive lobby boy, protégé and confidant Tony Revolori.There were a couple of things that surprised me about the film. First, that it was watchable at all. Second, that it actually appeared to have something of a coherent central story despite Anderson's strange trademark flourishes and flights of fancy. I was never bored with the film, although I was never on the edge of my seat either. I also never laughed once during the film and recognized fairly early that this was obviously going to be a funny peculiar film rather than a funny HA HA film. The film itself looks amazing. The art work, the camera work and model work are inventive and eye-catching. Fiennes central performance is wonderful even though there is not much evolution in this character.Unfortunately, Anderson's film mannerisms are much in evidence. I have yet to figure out how one makes a film seem self-impressed, but Anderson has perfected the tone and it is on full display here. One is always reminded that the film seems to believe it is much funnier and more clever than it truly is. His tone comes off as Woody Allen crossed with Tim Burton with a healthy dose of pretension and nastiness.Outside of Fiennes, the acting is uniformly unimpressive. A steady parade of familiar faces march past the camera, but most have little or nothing to do and no real point in the story. The wrap-around segment with the author, young writer and the adult version of the lobby boy, which employs Tom Wilkinson, Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham, could have been completely omitted from the film without consequence. In fact, the casting of Abraham seems absurd since Abraham looks nothing like the young Revolori and actually appears to be of a completely different ethnicity. With the exception of Fiennes and Brody, everyone reads their lines in a humorless deadpan that begins to grate after a while. I swear young Revolori, the only cast member to qualify as a co-lead, did not change expression or tone of voice in the entire film. And Edward Norton seems especially out of place as a foreign policeman with a jarring American accent.Anderson also has the ability to hit on something minor and milk it to death. The sequence where Fiennes contacts a society of concierge's to help him would have been amusing if it stopped after one or two concierge's, but it continues on to where it becomes tired. And why does Bill Murray keep showing up in these films in completely pointless, unfunny and undramatic forgettable cameos? I am also a bit weary of Anderson using pointless death as a punchline. When Brody gets angry at an honest lawyer, goon Dafoe throws the man's cat out the window to its death. Later, a character has his fingers chopped off and murdered and a woman has her head chopped off. The film could have easily ended after the resolution of the dowager's fortune, but Anderson and his fellow writers feel compelled to inform us that one main character was subsequently executed off screen and a third was killed with her child in an outbreak - all of which is delivered in the deadpan whimsy that preceded the most minor of scenes.In the end, the film is a step up from Anderson's other efforts and nice to look at, with a strong central performance from Fiennes. However, it is overrated, ostentatious, definitely not Oscar-worthy and terminally self-impressed with itself. And for a comedy, it is also not especially funny."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 July 2014,9/10,"I decided to watch this movie after i saw the high voting & the recommendation reviews, and guess what.....it really deserve it a lot. I watched it in home as DVD with Full HD which made the experience much much better. The movie has really fast start & the sequence of action is really fantastic & u never wanna the movie to end. The customs , the colors, the actors , the decor & the whole theme of movie is amazing. I just gave it 9, may be because it's quite expected end & the sequence has just stopped suddenly at the end which was sad. Great thanks to who ever brought such an amazing movie into reality. They also grabbed a really good bunch of actors with amazing performance.Overall it's a must watch movie, enjoy this one of a time peace of art."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 July 2014,9/10,"In 1932, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Gustave takes a young lobby boy named Zero (Tony Revolori) under his wing and trains him to be a more professional lobby boy. Gustave has a proclivity for dating older women. One of the older women he's dating, Madame D (Tilda Swinton) ends up dead. Madame D leaves Gustave a priceless painting, Called Boy With Apple and Madame D's son, Dimitri (Adrien Brody) suspects Gustave of murder. Moreover, Dimitri produces a witness produces a witness named Serge X (Mathieu Amalric) who implicates Gustave in the murder. Gustave is imprisoned by police officer Henkels, (Edward Norton) but breaks out of prison with the help of Zero and his girlfriend, Agatha. (Saoirse Ronan) The fugitive Gustave is hunted not only by Henkels, but also by Joplin (Willem Dafoe) a hit-man hired by Dimitri.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a very intricate movie, the viewer must follow the story very closely to fully appreciate the humor and pathos of the movie. Some of the comedy is broadly absurd, some more subtle. Underneath all the humor this is a story about the relationship between Zero and Gustave which starts out as a mentor mentee relationship, and evolves into a close friendship. The dialogue is typical Wes Anderson, stilted sentences, deadpan delivery, and a new wrinkle a lot of cursing for comedic effect. I've seen a lot Wes Anderson films, some I've liked, others not, but this and Moonrise Kingdom are two of his best.Anderson is a very visual director, every frame of this movie is infused with bright, vibrant colors, which is a hallmark of all his films and make his films stand out in comparison to other films. The animated exteriors add to the whimsical, ethereal nature of the film. Anderson has done animated exteriors before in movies like the Life Aquatic, but not to this extent.The acting is superb, led by Ralph Fiennes, who is hilarious as Gustave the concierge. He often waxes poetic in the movie only to be interrupted by more urgent circumstances. Fiennes shows a lot of range in his relationship with Zero, he is almost a surrogate father to the young immigrant. Adrien Brody is as lively as I've seen him in as Dimitri, Madame D's greedy cutthroat son. Edward Norton is good too, as a Keystone Cop type trying to find the truth of what happened to Madame D. Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori are really convincing as young lovers, falling in love in the middle of this madness, and trying to keep their love alive. F Murray Abraham is excellent as the adult Zero, and makes a great narrator. There are also many fine actors in smaller roles, Tilda Swinton as Madame D, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Wilkenson, and more all contribute to a very enjoyable film.For more grand movie reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2015,8/10,"One of the darlings of 2015's pre-Oscar activities, Wes Anderson creates a world full of quirky characters, bold costumes and scenery, and most importantly, witty dialog.While the plot of the movie is slightly convoluted from the normal Hollywood formula, it really is Mr. Anderson's fantasy world that captures and keeps the audience's attention. Bold colors. Quirk characters. Unexpected plot twists and turns. And a story that sort of leads you somewhere, but you never know where.As long as you are not expecting a typical action-adventure movie, I highly recommend visiting The Gand Budapest Hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2020,8/10,"For such a director, no matter how subtle the role, the actor will be willing to accept, because the most subtle role, but also enough personality, so that the audience remember.Exciting colors, unique characters, turbulent lens movement and the rhythm of take-off, can not stop the cool and praise."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 February 2015,2/10,"There is absolutely NOTHING witty in this film! Witty is NOT a word I would use to describe this film! Boring, tedious, dreadful, Very overly long, these are all the sorts of words that describe the film, not witty!!!!!!!! The cameos from all of those people were far from necessary! The makers, the writer and director etc. obviously thought 'Hmmm how can we get this crap to sell? How can we bring the viewers in? Cameos! And over-hyping! That's what we need! We need lots of cameos by lots of different actors and actresses and lots and lots and lots and....of over-hyping! If we offer enough money and they have room in their diaries.... and if we hype this rubbish as much as we possibly can....' and lo viewers came in their hundreds and thousands and spent a huge heap of money on a truly dire film! And as awards ceremonies such as the Academy Awards are just advertising and promotion(al) vehicles no wonder this crap film won awards in various places, it needed them! Oh, and if any proof was needed that we humans are all sheep then the fact that so many people flocked to see this rubbish and then actually watched it and then rated it so highly and gave it such good/great reviews proves it! There was such a long gap between plot points causing the film to feel very slow and very lumbered! Every time I have tried to see the film I have fallen asleep! Ralph Fiennes was good and carried the film. Thanks to all of the sheep flocking to the cinemas I bet Ralph, and the rest of the cast, is now pleased this crap is on his, and her, C. V.!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 May 2014,8/10,"Every once in a while a few special people in the movie industry make a film that is unique in several ways that it is a stand out one of a kind film. ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is such a film. It takes the viewer on a one of a kind adventure. Great casting makes it even better. So many characters developing a mixed bag of surprises. This film delivers a most unusual story but with a wit and humor not seen in recent years. This movie should be on the minds of Academy Awards pickers next spring for sure.R. Finnes turns in a robust performance through out the entire movie with his portrayal of a slime ball but creative head proprietor of this hotel. Go see it and enjoy a special film of a rare type that seems to be increasing in popularity with movie goers. It could be the sleeper of this year."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 October 2017,10/10,"When it came to comedy in my younger days, I always watched movies that make me howl with laughter like Ace Ventura or Animal House, but when my parents recommended The Grand Budapest Hotel, I watched the trailer and it peaked my interest and I later watched it and absolutely adored it. From it's ingenious writing and glorious visuals to it's comedy and acting, this is what so many modern comedies aspire to be and yet always fail.The movie opens in modern day where a young woman reads from a book by an author who vacationed at a run-down hotel in the Republic of Zubrowka called The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1960s where he encounters the owner named Moustafa who tells him the story of how he inherited the hotel. We are than again thirsted back to 1932 where the Grand Budapest's attendant, M. Gustave is busily attending to the desires of the hotel's rich customers as well as educating Moustafa who is the hotel's new lobby boy, but when a favorite client of his is killed under questionable conditions, he is framed for killing her and is placed under arrest but is able to escape. Now, Gustave and Zero must clear his name and reclaim what is rightfully his.While on the surface, the movie may seem like a zany comedy with a murder thrown in for good measure, it's actually a series of arranged events in which many people tell the story of M. Gustave over the years while the extraordinary intro hints at the boundless creativity of director Wes Anderson. Some viewers might think that it's pointless, but it does give a lot of background when the last title card shows up, summing up the reason for the time skip, but it doesn't let up as the movie is a comical multiple genre journey that never seems to slow down for a breather, but even when it gets to the tense moments, there's always a sense of cheeriness right up until the movie ends. Much like what Quentin Tarantino did with Inglorious Bastards with it's self-awareness and adjusting of history, it's hardly surprising that Wes Anderson added in references to WW II throughout the movie as it's based off of a few books by author Stefan Zweig which adds to the authenticity of the movie not to mention that throughout the movie, the war rushes our heroes and villains to carry out their motives rapidly in order to accomplish their various ambitions which adds to the authenticity of the movie.While the human characters are fascinating, The Grand Budapest Hotel feels like a character itself with its spectacular setting, the baths, the hallways, tall roofs, soft colors and identical carpets and walls all give the viewer a sense of grandeur and awe making the viewer feel like they are actually staying there while the visual landscape and photography is simply gorgeous and not only ingenious in approach but also beautiful in gorgeous and smooth editing not to mention the production design, the clothes, hair and make-up all justly earned their Oscar wins as they encompass a distinctively bright and enchanted aura to them while at the same time giving meaning to the gloomy aspect that mirrors the crime drama characteristics of the movie wonderfully. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is also wonderful with its memorably compelling and captivating musical themes while the film's score crafts a whole new setting for the movie's characters to thrive in and the themes for the various characters are just as attention-grabbing. While the movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, it's still a laugh riot and there's pretty to chuckle at in the movie from Gustave's prison breakout scene to him and Zero fleeing across the snow. The characters are portrayed to such excessiveness that it's impossible not to be entertained by watching them in spite of the dangers they face, the witting too is marvelous with plenty of hilarious lines that are bound to make you laugh your head off more times than once during the movie.To make the movie complete, Anderson recruited one of the best ensemble casts for a comedy I've ever seen and everyone is perfect in their roles. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as pastry chef Agatha, Tilda Swinton leaves a wonderful impression as Madame D and gives a fine performance, Jeff Goldblum is fantastic as a doomed attorney, Bill Murray is great in his role as is Owen Wilson, Edward Norton is great as the police chief, F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as the older Moustafa, Adrian Brody is awesome as Madame D's conniving son while Willem Defoe is perfect as the evil and brutal psychopath especially when he's standing in the shadows and endangers unsuspecting targets. Ralph Fiennes is fabulous as M. Gustave and brings his familiar endurance to this outlandishly bizarre character, but in a comical curve puts on a formal yet amusingly vulgar witty persona that is more than captivating and there's no absence of hilarious dialog coming from his mouth as he spouts passionate poetry, biting banter or distasteful fits of swearing, truly one of the finest comedic performances of the decade. Assisting in Ralph's crazy adventures is the inexperienced yet ever devoted Zero, perfectly acted by Tony Revolori who brings a dash of boyish zazz to the role as Zero learns his surroundings, but we do learn about his troubled past later on in the film not to mention the interaction between him and Fiennes is so heart-melting as it feels like a father-son relationship by the movie's end.Honestly, there's nothing else I can say about the Grand Budapest Hotel, it's a wonderful comedy that provides plenty of laugh-out-lord moments but still manages to stand above most other comedy movies by being intelligent with it's writing, characters and humor, so if you want a comedy movie that won't insult your intelligence than this is your movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2020,8/10,"Great acting with great comedy and outstanding visuals and storytelling, I even got Citizen Kane vibes on some scenes. A perfect movie for entertainment purposes and for a family session.
Highly recommend it!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2021,8/10,"It is a nice movie filled with love, friendship, trust, emotions. Do watch it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 October 2014,8/10,"""Keep your hands off my lobby boy!"" From the colorful yet quirky mind of Wes Anderson comes another triumph in the books for this original director/screenwriter. As lavish visual environments are put on display to explore deeply emotional ideas, Anderson also intertwines the pathos into unlocking true human sentimentality. Based on the 1944 memoir of Austrian playwright and journalist Stephan Zweig entitled The World of Yesterday, it was Anderson who cited it as the spark for his new film. Nonetheless, this English-language comedy-drama film starring Ralph Fiennes as a Shakespeare-spouting concierge who teams up with one of his employees, albeit only friend, to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder is engrossing and enjoyable indeed. Grossing $46 million dollars plus to date, Anderson's latest does not disappoint nay hinder from his trademark comedy, idiosyncratic characters (and some cameos from the Anderson regulars) and pastel-colored perfectionism, raising the bar to new heights yet again for himself and his audience. But with all that said, what truly makes 'The Grand Budapest' sogrand? Let's take a look. In the present, a teenage girl approaches a monument built to a writer in a snow-covered cemetery decorated with various hotel lobby keys. In her arms she holds a memoir penned by a character only known as ""The Author."" She then begins reading a chapter about a trip he personally made to the Grand Budapest in the late 1960's as a much leaner and younger man, portrayed by Jude Law. He visits the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state ravaged by war and poverty. The Grand Budapest has indeed fallen on hard times, as it has appeared to have lost its essence of grandeur due to the tragic war-ridden atmosphere of the nation. Many of the lustrous facilities of the place are now in a poor state of repair,and the guests seemed to have dwindled down to hardly anyone.It is here that ""The Author"" encounters the owner of the old hotel one afternoon named Zero Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Over dinner in the Budapest's enormous dining hall, Zero tells the tale of how he came to take ownership of the establishment and why he is adamant about not closing it down for good. His story begins back in the heyday of the hotel in 1932 and during its final glory days before the Republic became infested by war. When young Zero first came to the hotel and worked as a lobby boy (played by Tony Revolori) he also befriended the elegantly-spoken and devoted concierge Monsieur Gustave H. While not engaging with the wealthy clientele or managing the staff, Gustave is busy courting a series of aged blonde women, as they flock to the hotel for his ""exceptional service."" Fiennes' character that makes the biggest impression on the film. His rapid-fire delivery and dry wit throughout kept the film moving along ebulliently, thanks to Anderson's genius script. One of the ladies he spends the night with prior to her departure the next morning is the elderly Madame D. (Tilda Swinton). A few days later, Gustave is informed that Madame D. has died due to mysterious circumstances. Taking Zero with him, he races to her wake and the reading of the will, where he learns that she has bequeathed a valuable painting to him entitled Boy with Apple. Her family is thus enraged, all of whom have hoped to inherit it. But none is more enraged than her wild-haired son with the short fuse, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis (monstrously performed by Adrian Brody), who lashes out at Gustave.With the help of Zero, Gustave takes the painting, returns to the Grand Budapest and stores the sacred artifact in the hotel vault. During the journey, Gustave makes a pact with Zero—in return for the latter's assistance, he makes the lobby boy his soulful heir. Shortly after, Gustave is arrested and imprisoned for the supposed murder of Madame D., and it is up to Zero to clear his name to find the real assassin who set him up in the first place. I will not spoil it for you, but what follows shortly afterwards is a madcap, yet sublime whodunit along with a menagerie of memorable caricatures all toting unique and peculiar personas as only Anderson can create with psychology and pen in tow. The result is a colorful melee of crime and capers just waiting to be gobbled up by Anderson fans and the public alike; a sumptuous treat for the eyes as almost actually sampling a saccharine Mendl's confection.Shot entirely on location in Germany, mainly in Görlitz and other parts of Saxony as well as at Studio Babelsberg, Anderson chose to shoot the film in three aspect ratios, 1.33, 1.85, and 2.35:1, one for each timeline. For wide shots of the hotel, Anderson went with a nine-foot-tall handmade miniature model because he felt that, since general audiences would know that the shot was artificial, computer-generated effects, such as in his previous films being The Life Aquatic and more extensively in Fantastic Mr. Fox were created to the extent to be best captured in a cinematic sense. The movie, after all, demands repeatable viewings, mainly due to its quick humor and amazing visuals. It is pretty much an old-fashioned screwball comedy but in color, and Anderson, cast and crew pull it off fluently. Garishly garbed, deceptively thoughtful and dizzily eccentric, Grand Budapest pulls all the right stops into turning its oft macabre into supple jokes. To truly experience the flume ride down the snowy slopes of this original director's psyche, you will have to check out the Grand Budapest to check in for your stay. And once the time comes for you to leave, you will want to check in again just to experience the thrill twice fold. A hotel flick with flair, and a few spritzes of L'Air de Panache, it definitely deserves anything but a ""Zero."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 June 2020,10/10,"A visual masterpiece, Wes Anderson took his style and critics and went to the next level, and doing what he does best, make movies that feel like movies. this film serves as painting, the visual style is a narrative on its own, accompanied by the story narrative. These two narratives correlate to create this ultimate, immersive, graphic, and evocative stream. it's a story, inside a story, inside a story, inside a story, and each story is loyal to its period's popular aspect ratio ( yes the changing of aspect ratio has a meaning), it's a perfect comedic tragedy wes took from the comedic language oof twenties and thirties cinema and gave it a twist of modernity. Emotions are conveyed with colors, light, and mise on scene techniques rather than poignant dialogues or melodrama, and it worked perfectly. This film touches the spectator on a sensual level, it's engaging and makes you wanna dive in its world. in general, it reminded me of the euphoria I felt when I watched movies as a child. it's definitely Wes Anderson on steroids embracing nostalgia and fighting tyranny with irony, frivolity, and unshakable charm (hens the ZZ is a hint to the dutch SS). a perfection and one of my fave of all times."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 August 2020,8/10,"This movie was just too much!! But in a good way. It's not ""hilarious"" - it's entertaining. It's not beautiful - it's cinematic. It's a modern classic. It's a total mood of its own. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Definitely worth the watch!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 January 2015,9/10,"The grand Budapest hotel is about Gustave H, a legendary concierge at the grand Budapest hotel. He goes on a weird and funny adventure with his Lobby boy, Zero. This was the first movie I've seen by Wes Anderson and wow I loved it. Seeing the trailer, the way it was filmed made me sort of not want to watch it. I gave it a chance and it was amazing what Wes Anderson can do. Every shot was breath taking. The acting was great by Ralph Fiennes(Gustave H) and zero(Tony Revolori) aka lobby boy. There were lots of great cameos by Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,and many more great actors and actress. Overall The grand Budapest hotel was worth a watch with its great cast and its brilliant director Wes Anderson."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,8/10,"Prepare to be treated to another wildly, wonderful creation by Wes Anderson. More than a movie, this is an ""experience"" where you will smile, giggle, occasionally laugh out loud, as well as gasp and maybe even shed a tear.Visually stunning, with many subtle touches, the ""plot"" is secondary to the adventure and the characters involved, with a touch of history thrown in for good measure. The young Zero is a pure delight--let's hope we see a lot more of him in upcoming productions.Anderson is a genius, creatively-speaking, and his films never disappoint. They are unique, at times madcap, and make us nostalgic for the great films of the past. Who will take up the torch in the future? Well, for now, I will just enjoy Anderson's films as much as possible."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,8/10,"As butts of humor go, the Nazis are the gift that keeps on giving. In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" writer-director Wes Anderson continues the proud tradition of ""To Be or Not to Be,"" ""The Great Dictator,"" ""A Night in Casablanca"" and ""The Producers"" in making totalitarianism grist for the comedic mill.Inspired by the writings of Austrian novelist, playwright and journalist Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" stars Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who joins with one of his employees (the wondrous 17-year-old actor Tony Revolori whose almond-shaped Wile E. Coyote eyes practically steal the film all by themselves) to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder.The film opens with a teen-aged girl stopping at the cemetery monument of a writer (Tom Wilkinson) while toting a memoir penned by a character only known as ""The Author."" She begins reading a chapter about a trip he made to the Grand Budapest Hotel a half-century ago.Suddenly we're in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state, where we find the once-grand hotel now threadbare and mostly vacant.The young version of the writer (played by Jude Law) meets the hotel's old owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham as an elderly version of Revolori's character) and over dinner in the hotel's enormous but empty dining room, Zero tells him the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel and why he is unwilling to close it down.The owner's tale starts circa 1932 in the final years of the hotel's salad days, when he worked as a lobby boy, around the time Nazi-like thugs begin a rise to power.Zubrowka is teetering on the brink of war, of course (wink-wink), but Gustave, the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge (the terrifically deadpan Fiennes _ the anti-Groucho) is blissfully oblivious as he wines and dines a series of aging, blonde women who love the hotel because of his, uh, ""exceptional service."" One of the these ladies is Madame D (Tilda Swinton), whom Gustave spends the night with before her departure (a departure, as it turns out, in more ways then one).Madame D turns up dead (apparently not at all by natural causes), and Gustave, with Zero in tow, races to her wake and the quick-to-follow reading of the will, where he finds that she's left him with the priceless painting, ""Boy With Apple."" The family is enraged, and the chase is on. And so is the war.At one point, Gustave is arrested and imprisoned for the murder of Madame D.To say much more would spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that Gustave's path is littered with some fascinating characters played by, in no particular order, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Saorise Ronan, Lea Seydoux, Giselda Volodi and a raft of perfectly cast featured actors. To the person, each fully grasps the value of underplaying.There are some wonderful touches, like the name of the newspaper announcing the start of the war _ ""The Times-Alpine Yodel"" _ and comically contrapuntal title cards that take on a life of their own. Anderson's use of ridiculous miniatures that would make ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" proud absolutely work, as do his signature use of rostrum camera shots and slow motion.But those of us of a certain age find special satisfaction in Anderson's wicked presentation of the would-be Nazis. It's almost enough to want Hitler back for a nanosecond so he could be insulted.It seems fitting, beautifully so, that ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" opened the 2014 Berlin Film Festival _ and that it won the Grand Jury Prize. And ""heil"" all over you-know-who."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 October 2020,8/10,"This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I honestly don't know how to categorise it, and I honestly don't think I can.The Grand Budapest Hotel felt less like a movie and more like a candy-coloured, precisely executed piece of art. There's something about Wes Anderson's genre-bending plot lines and sharply witty humour that makes this movie truly unique, and I love it for it.The story is highly entertaining and very original, and takes you on a very colourful adventure to places you would never think it would go to. The cinematography in this movie will forever make it one the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The whole thing is coated in this candy-coloured hue that makes the entire movie feel like a pastel dream that doesn't feel quite real. And of course you have the unmistakably Wes Anderson symmetrical shots.This movie is hilarious. I think that it is, hands down, one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Now, as someone who absolutely loathes romantic comedies and their cheesy humour, I loved Wes Anderson's dry, sarcastic and off-beat sense of humour. All of he jokes landed perfectly, and it elevated this movie even further past the confines of something regular. The way that the movie, even at its most serious times, there's always a dryly funny undertone which never failed to make me smile.I love The Grand Budapest Hotel for all its bizarreness, and I will for sure start watching more of Wes Anderson's films.-Sasha."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2016,9/10,"Excluding Uwe Boll, Wes Anderson has likely the most distinct visual style in modern film. His set-pieces brim with colour and detail, yes, but his most obvious stylistic abnormality resides in the presentation of his bijou quirks to the audience. Instead of intensely revealing all that is going on in a scene with a single brutally long tracking shot - a la Inarritu -- Anderson opts instead for the short and sweet, a usually center-framed ground- level shot with a large depth of field that moves only on a rail, pivot, or gratuitous zoom. If it were anyone other than Anderson behind the wheel, the film that adopted this style would surely devolve into monotonous repetition by the ten-minute mark.But then you have something like this:You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... oh, f*** it.And that is precisely why I love Wes Anderson. His dialogue, and for that matter, his set-pieces and even the most trivial of details are all imbued with joyous irreverence, narrative glee, and fantastic explosion of shapes and colours that even the most CGI-encrusted extravaganzas couldn't even come close to comparison. At times, his visual style becomes the substance of the film that carries it from scene to scene, never allowing the film to segue into monotony.The plot itself is an afterthought compared to the film's visual euphoria. However, the performances, specifically Fiennes', are not. Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the legendary proprietor of The Grand Budapest Hotel, who is charged with the murder of the woman (Tilda Swinton) who left him a priceless painting, Boy with Apple. Fiennes exploits his character's wide spectrum of comportment -- from surprising eloquence to equally surprising vulgarity -- with meticulous skill, charmingly deadpan in every single line he delivers.The film is a jumble of quirks and lightness until its conclusion. It suddenly takes a sombre tone, ending on a rather heavy note. Anderson is able to pull off this tonal shift by maintaining his unique style throughout, but the ending is effective in itself. It leaves the audience simultaneously satisfied and sad, urging them to think about the implications of what they have just witnessed: a lovely film built around a madcap style that explores the extent of the narrative, the pure act of storytelling itself, and the outer reaches of what we call empathy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 May 2014,10/10,"If I told a film fan that a film directed by Wes Anderson was basically a live action cartoon, would they be surprised? Well, I don't think so. So it came as no surprise to me when I saw The Grand Budapest Hotel, that it had one wacky scene after another. With The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson has made another masterpiece of comical proportions. A film that is so absurd and yet so greatly made, it has to be seen to be believed.The Grand Budapest Hotel continues Wes Anderson's ridiculousness. As a director, Anderson has made quite the career for himself. He's a true auteur, having a distinct style that is apparent in all of his films. Most of them are about depressing characters, and they feature black humor; lots and lots of it. The Grand Budapest Hotel, as its title would suggest, is about a hotel located in Europe. The film actually takes place in about three different time periods. Though they never say it, the film opens in the present, and then flashbacks to 1985 and 1932. The present scenes concern a girl. While the scenes in the 1982 concerns a young writer (Jude Law) who visits the hotel and encounters Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who recalls about a story about when he was a lobby boy working under the whim of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) at the hotel, and how the two ended up getting involved in a crime involving murder and theft.This film seems to have a lot going on. At the same time, it's played out at such at a silly pace, that I can't help but smile. There is a lot to laugh about in this film. From the prison escape scene, where Gustave and company stands on really high places just to escape, to the snow chase with Gustave and Zero attempting to get Jopling (Willem Dafoe), this film is a riot. The characters in this movie are played to such extremes; that they are fun to watch, in spite of the problems they seem to be facing. Although this film deals with not so friendly themes, it never takes itself too seriously, instead opting to put into the ""Anderson world"", where physics and reality take a back seat to extreme shenanigans.This movie is helped very much by its actors. Anderson has brought back some of his old cast, in addition to some new people. Returning favorites include, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson, but we also meet such newcomers such as, F. Murray Abraham, and the film's newcomer (the actor had actually been in a movie and some TV shows), Tony Revolvri all bring their A game to this Wes Anderson's jam. Although the majority of the actors in this film take a back seat too Fiennes, most of them seem to fit right in with Anderson's nonsensical style.The actors all play different roles. Ralph Fiennes is the hotel's strict but likable owner, Adrien Brody is one of the villains of the story, and tries to make his voice deep and menacing, but comes off as silly, which seems to be intentional, given the tone of the film. Tilda Swinton brings her acting skills to a nothing role, where she spends the majority of the film as a corpse. Edward Norton does well as a serious officer, despite limited screen time. Bill Murray has a thankless but important role. Jason Schwartzman appears at the beginning as one of the people working at hotel in 1985 and then disappears for the remainder of the film. Willem Dafoe is playing his usual slimy, creepy character, a killer, and Jeff Goldblum plays a deputy who delivers a lot of expression, but gets a moment to shine (Goldblum and Dafoe have a chase scene, which is interesting, when you consider that the two have only worked with Wes Anderson once before, in the same movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou). Saoirse Ronan is nice and calm in her role as a young woman who falls for the bellhop. Speaking of the bellhop, in his film debut, Tony Revolori shows a lot of energy for someone who is new to acting, especially when compared to the other actors in this film. The actors in this film are very much essential to what makes this film work. They are the glue to Wes Anderson's script. Their wacky and sometimes calm performances fit in very well, here.The film has plenty of funny moments. Quotes such as ""The rest of this #hit is worthless junk"", had my audience cracking up. Anderson certainly knows how to write a good script. Additionally, the film uses a classical score, much like most of Anderson's films, with things such as violins and pianos being heard in the background.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience in many ways. It's a film that I have a lot interest to go back to see, over and over again. The actors, the directing, the humor, it just all somehow works, to make a wondrously silly film, that is deserving of the Wes Anderson name. With this film I'm reminded of why I'm such a big fan of Wes Anderson, he makes the kinds of movies I would want to make, if I was making a feature films right now."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 May 2020,9/10,"While retaining Wes Anderson's unique camera lens, composition, color editing, and music features, storytelling and character creation are equally successful."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 December 2016,2/10,"I give this Wes Anderson movie a '2' simply for the fascinating oddity of its comic-book style. Come to think of it, he might as well have made an animated feature, for all the reality you'll ever see in this toy-theatre of a show.Anderson has made pretentious claims to being inspired by the writings of Stephen Zweig. This is giving hostage to fortune, because when I investigated the nature of this influence, I found it explained precisely why this film is the quintessential Anderson contrivance, and as unsatisfying as the luridly-coloured, insubstantial confections his characters are so addicted to.Michael Hofmann, writing in the 28th January 2010 edition of the London Review of Books, has the following choice comments about Anderson's literary hero, which serve to tell us a lot about the film maker's taste:'Hofmannsthal's friend Leopold von Andrian put himself through a Zweig novella . . . 'reluctantly, a spoonful a day, like a nasty-tasting medicine', and, in the course of a comprehensive, paragraph-long taking-apart, wrote: 'each sentence incredibly pretentious, false and empty – the whole thing a complete void'.' '. . . there is an unusual consensus here – Mann, Musil, Brecht, Hesse, Canetti, Hofmannsthal, Kraus – to the effect that Stefan Zweig was a purveyor of Trivialliteratur and, save in commercial terms, an utterly negligible figure.''Zweig himself speaks a little smugly in his autobiography, The World of Yesterday, of 'this preference of mine for intense, intemperate characters in my novels and novellas'. 'The typical Zweig story,' the critic William Deresiewicz notes, cooling to his subject in an afterword, 'is a tale of monomaniacal passion set loose amid the veiled, upholstered civility of the Austrian bourgeoisie, the class into which Zweig was born.' ''Zweig is both an absolutely natural and an absolutely dreadful writer; the one quality of course does not preclude the other.'Indeed. Anderson has great technical facility, and the films he cranks out are like meticulous clockwork complications that are the be-all and the end-all of the exercise. But we don't go to the cinema to see a clockwork doll. We go to expand our sense of humanity. Anderson has, with 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' produced something that is certainly the masterpiece of his airless, unreal personal fantasy. His cutely contrived models are manipulated with obsessive skill, and animated with all the hyperactive energy of automata. Any stray reflection of adult or real existence is instantly trivialised, and drained of all life by the manic mimetic puppetry of a creation that is trapped in the primitive ethos of childhood's purely sensory and dynamic distractions. How Anderson's embarrassingly immature entertainments have ever been credited with the status of artistry is beyond me. He's like a teenager still fixated by an infantile world he is unwilling or unable to put away. His inappropriately prolonged innocence is not charming - it is embarrassing. It is a kind of decadence. It is perhaps honest insofar as it is a true reflection of the profoundly infantile nature of most North American culture. This is play as self-indulgence, not as wit or irony. It is the world seen at the level of the rug-rat, with a prospect of weird multi-coloured toys scattered in improbable relations by the drifting inconsequence of free-wheeling fantasy. It is a world that charms similarly immature and adolescent sensibilities, but repels those with more grown-up tastes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 February 2015,3/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", Wes Anderson's most successful film to date, is visually enthralling, every frame a veritable art museum painting (and not just on the level of ""Boy with Apple""), cleverly utilizing glass-paintings and CGI-enhanced locations in Germany and Poland actually to the level of picture postcards. That may also be its problem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show. Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naiveté. While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence, I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial. Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, ""How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?"" I'm still waiting for the answer."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2021,9/10,Every single shot was just so pretty and aesthetic. Wes did a phenomenal job. The movie is absolutely brilliant and it probably find myself rewatching it so grab any further details that i might have missed. So so good!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2014,6/10,"Much like the protagonist in the story, the film is all style no substance. For some reason, whenever I go to see a movie in the theater I eat a large bag of candy and a huge soda, I don't do this anywhere else in life but for this movie it was strangely fitting. At first, when watching Grand Budapest, It was Visually appealing and indeed Anderson may have missed his true calling as a premiere interior designer for the European aristocracy, as each scene is set up perfectly. My problem with the movie, and all Andersons movie's post Rushmore for that matter, is you don't really walk away from the films having gained anything as far as insight into life, or rewarding feeling you may have after let's say watching Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" which was layered. Sure, GBH was pretty to look at, and it is fun to see all the great actors (mostly used as props in the same way the villains 1932 Sara lea motorcycle was used) but when leaving the theater this time I felt a bit sick after, and I'm not sure it was completely the fault of eating the large bag of candy and sugary soda, in fact I felt more sick than I usually do after leaving the theater."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie directed by Wes Anderson who is a really extraordinary director for sure and this movie have a lots of actors / actress and when i say a lot i mean it , There is so much actors and actress in this movie such as Tilda Swinton , Bill Murray , Tom Wilkinson , Jeff Goldblum , Harvel Keitel and a lot more but the really main actor or actress in the movie is actually Ralph Fiennes , Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori but don't mind the screen time for your favorite actors or actress just go for it , everyone in this movie is pretty awesome and really great in it.I have to say that this movie have a really really great Production Design they doing such a perfect job on it , every single piece in the movie are all really well crafted and you can see every detail on every scene in the movie which is really impressive.Director Wes Anderson in this movie also does a really really great job with amazing camera movement and unique storytelling that just blow my minds with this art style from him , even though the movie falls off a bit in plot which is kind of a cliché , repetitive and not much to say but when it combines with Wes Anderson work and really amazing production design you just doesn't notice the bad stuff at all because you're enjoying it so much .In the end The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see movie for sure with really awesome and great actors and actress all around combine with amazing works from director Wes Anderson and stunning Production Design makes this movie really one of the most ( if not the most ) memorable movie of this year for sure ."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 December 2014,8/10,"Storyteller/Director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) without fail would be one of my favourite directors, his artistic eye for detail and storytelling has a life all of its own, he has a way to draw you in and keep you engaged even when there is really nothing happening, with his unique style of camera work and his absolutely gorgeous locations, he has a unique ability to reinvent colour so that his sets are a world within themselves and so inviting. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a tale within a tale within a tale, the film begins acknowledging that on the farthest eastern boundary of the Eastern continent: The former republic of Zubrowka once the seat of an Empire a young girl walks up to and stands in front of a monument covered in hotel keys and holders, she reaches into her pocket and adds her own. A plaque reads ""Author"" ""in honour of our National treasure, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a book with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel written across its front, she then turns the book over to reveal a black and white picture of the ""Author"". The picture turns to colour and the Author begins narrating the story from behind his desk in 1985. He begins to tell the story of a hotel he once visited many years earlier in 1968 the hotel of course was The Grand Budapest. Set in a fictitious place the hotel stood in Alpine Alps somewhere in Europe. The young Author talks about how the once Grand Budapest hotel is now in a dire state, run down and looking a lot worse for wear. Whilst bathing he meets the current owner a mysterious and sad looking man, he soon learns this man is the current owner, he learns that he was once the richest man in the world who owned all the riches one could ever imagine. The owner invites the author to a meal and begins to tell his story. The owner agrees and begins to tell his tale of how he arrived and now owns the Grand Budapest Hotel. Flash back to 1932 and the owner now a young lobby boy begins the tale once more for the author he begins to fill the ears of the Author as he is whisked away to another time and into a life of murder, theft, love, sex, art and riches.. Visually this story is stunning, plot wise the story telling is masterful, the camera shots used are vibrant and gorgeous, the score is an absolute journey from begging to end, the humour is endless, a little dark in places but still very typical of Wes Anderson's style. At times it did run a little slow in places but not enough to take anything negative. The cast was huge, so many big well-known names and every one of them played their character perfectly. Ralph Fiennes (Clash of the Titans, The Hurt Locker) as Monsieur Gustave H, was brilliant darling so charismatic and lovable. Tony Revolori (very new to the movie world) as Young Zero Moustafa was also amazing as Gustave H right hand man. F. Murray Abraham (Scarface, Amadeus) as Old Zero Moustafa. Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong) as the vile Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis, Willem Dafoe (The English Patient, Spider-Man) as J.G. Jopling Dmitri's right hand assassin. Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, Independence Day) as Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, add to this already amazing ensemble Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and a plethora of other very big names and you start to get an idea at how big this film really is. You would think having so many huge names could only equal bigger egos and a total mess, but it is the complete opposite. I loved The Grand Budapest Hotel it is unlike Wes Andersons other film in the sense that this one has much more of a plot which of course only helps. I would recommend this for anyone who can look beyond big bangs and actually enjoy a real film. If your idea of a great film is Die Hard or something else as crass and pointless I wouldn't bother because you actually need to be slightly intellectual to really enjoy this one. Better yet if you don't like films with subtitles stay away, not that this has any it'll just make you think more than you normally would like to."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 March 2015,8/10,"Wes Anderson's dazzling comedy caper 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' tells the story of legendary millionaire Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Situated in the Republic of Zubrowka, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a gloriously pink old Baroque European establishment where rich people go to spend time. It is here where Zero started as the hotel's lobby boy.In 1932, young Zero (Tony Revolori) was hired and worked under the direct tutelage of legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). One of his most loyal customers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), passes away leaving him an invaluable painting, much to the annoyance of her despicable son and heir Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who frames Gustave for Madame D's murder.This charming hotel is a cinematic event in itself, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is very much a filmmakers film with some outstanding cinematography. Everyone from Anderson to the art directors, set designers, cinematographers, and composer are as much the stars in an all-star line-up including Bill Murray, Mathieu Amalric, Saoirse Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Willem Defoe, Léa Seydoux, and Jeff Goldblum.Gustave is a hilarious creation, so typically English in his genteel courtesies, wit and humility. Fiennes is perfectly cast and must have relished playing such a delightful character. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' has an energy which previous films by Anderson lacked, told with a much more purposeful sense of storytelling which feels real.I've never been a fan of Andersons cultivated brand of quirks and charms, films with irritating characterisations and cameos, mannered dialogue and contrived use of twee and nostalgia. And what does he see in Owen Wilson? Above all of this and much more, his films often lack any genuine character development, resulting in often uninteresting films full of sheen and little substance. But in Gustave H. he's finally crafted a well- rounded individual which we can believe in and appreciate, regardless of how fantastical he appears.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is Anderson's most accomplished film yet, it's his most genuine work and will certainly make you smile."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 July 2015,10/10,"The first thing that struck me with ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is how much it reminded me on quirky ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" (2001) which I loved back than and always will. No one usually talks much about it but I see traces of ""Amélie"" very often here and there, the narrative, voice-over and all. Apparently this director is already known for his highly recognizable visual style and equally criticized and loved for it - I for one, love it and not only that I ""get it"", I actually wallow in every meticulously pre-arranged scene that makes movie look like some overblown marzipan cake it would probably take me several re-viewing to grasp all the countless little details. So what is here not to be liked? I really wonder - since it delighted me so much - who are those people who snicker and dislike what I find to be unforgettable joy of a movie? Could it be they are so used to familiar action/crime/murder clichés that they wont accept anything that is not fitting into boxes? That Wes Anderson (who, by the way was born in the same year as me, and uses my beloved Stefan Zweig as reference) is too creative and original for them? Contrary to these opinions, I am so relieved, glad and yes, thrilled that there are still directors around who love what they do and follow their own muse instead of making just another forgettable products on the factory line - ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" might seem odd to some, but to me it stands head and shoulders above anything that I see advertised these days."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2014,8/10,"That's why cinema is still regarded as art. A mesmerizing visual journey along with Wes Anderson's palatial intellect. Wes is blossoming his artistic mastermind day by day and TGBH, with no regard, is his best creation. Colorful and spellbound setting throughout the film again provides his eloquent vision. Unique representation with uncanny humor remains his style as always. Ralph Fiennes, as M. Gustave, appears completely in an unmatched role and deserves an Oscar nomination. Johnny Depp was first thought to be in the character and in his absence, Fiennes has just nailed it. All other star actors, along with Gustav's sidekick Zero, also flawlessly feature in the feast of whimsical Wes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,9/10,"I have actually the feeling that movies like this expand my synapses rapidly...This film deserves to be acclaimed not only because it represents the best features of our civilization, but also because it is masterfully executed. This peculiar story about the concierge Gustave and his loyal lobby boy Zero is a beautiful and intriguing comedic thriller tale. But it is deceptive. The main character is ""The Author"". But who is the author?The emotionally ornamented journey of the viewer is carefully prepared. We witness how Gustave and Zero overcome many obstacles during their adventure between the two European wars. But the main focal point is on the elegance of the human behavior. Education and good manners are just the package, the insights of this movie dessert are the care and love which we feel through this nostalgic piece of cinematography. In our modern times of speed and greed we forget way too often that we can change each other's energy the right way. This movie is a cheerful escapism to a more romantic world which we lost a century ago. And what about the cast, what about the acting? Ralph Fiennes is such a driving force. He delivers both funny and dramatic performance, complemented by a constellation of good actors and actresses such as Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum and the young Tony Revolori. The music is unconventionally good and I very much liked the sets and costumes. But let's get back to the author. The movie ends with a dedication to Stefan Zweig. This is the logical conclusion to the Wes Anderson's (the director) message to the public. And to translate that into words I will paraphrase Zweig himself: - Every man with a moral sense will always consider his own existence empty and insignificant without the comforting thought and empowering illusion that he, as a separate entity, may contribute something to the overall improvement of the moral world. The man becomes an author through his aspirations and activities. The creator's imagination which can change the world for the better."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 October 2020,10/10,"For those lucky enough to have been avid moviegoers in 2014, when it appears film was at its 21st century best, The Grand Budapest Hotel proved to be a diamond in the midst of emeralds. The plot seems simple: an aging hotel owner recounts the tale of how he went from refugee to wealthy property owner. Yet, the story is not so plain. Full of zigs and zags draped in regal costuming and set pieces, The Grand Budapest Hotel is arguably - no, definitively the most wonderful bit of cinematic expression from that year.The film stars Wes Anderson regulars, Ralph Fiennes, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swenton, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Adrien Brody. But the great magnitude of traditional Anderson actors does not outshine our newest key characters Zero (Tony Revolori) and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who are remarkable as the young lobby boy and his inevitable bride.I am overwhelmed with internal frustration when thinking about this movie. I am afraid that never again will I see such a film. The vibrancy of the color pallet is undeniable. The enticing blend of humor, morose, and hope is inspiring. The rewatchability factor is at an all time high. There is simply nothing bad I can say about this movie. Wes Anderson has once again capitalized on his style of pastels and symmetry without becoming repetitive.I pray The Grand Budapest Hotel never leaved Netflix. I have watched it more times than I dare admit. For those who wish to learn about screenwriting and the fashioning of great characters, go out and buy the script. You will not regret it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 July 2018,6/10,This movie is a story told by one of the fictional characters that is in a fictional country and lives in fictional hotel. The scenes were just jumps in the story but comes in the appropriate order.. The characters do not tell jokes BUT the ordinary and sometimes the not so ordinary behavior the characters do that make it funny along with the an unexpected sequence of events. This movie is so colorful with clear spoken language and shot in attractive way.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 March 2014,1/10,"Don't be fooled by the people who gave high rating.If compared to other box office movies, like the Avengers, Avatar, Lord of the Rings, and others, this movie is pretty boring, boring, and boring.If it's a drama movie and compared to other drama movie you'll also agree that it's boring, boring, and boring.I just don't know where to start. From the setting, the storyline, the writing and everything else, it's just not interesting.This is actually a fact for any film which is considered ""good"" by some association of film festival. It will never reach very high revenue as other box office movies because it's just boring, boring, and boring.I don't know why those people have weird taste in movies?If you say it's a bad movie, but billions of viewers out there watched it in cinema and the film successfully earned hundreds of millions of dollars, then you can say it's a damn good movie! Your opinion sucks!If you say it's a good movie, but it's only watched by a few million and won a certain award in some film festival, then your the only weirdo in the world. Well actually you are one of those weirdos with bad taste for movie.In short this movie is just boring, boring, and boring! Trust me! It won't earn a lot of money in the world! So don't even bother of watching it!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 March 2014,7/10,"I saw the trailer for this film several times in other movie outings. Trailer was great. Now, one hopes that they did not put all the great bits in the trailer, that they held some stuff back. But no. So when we saw the film, we thought it was fun and whimsical, but nothing too special or funny. All the really potentially funny parts were already revealed in the trailer. Perhaps that's why we were underwhelmed by the film in the end. The costumes, colors, and decor are great. The scenery, the whimsical gadgets and characters were also great. But, like some people mentioned, there wasn't really anyone that we cared for. We cared a little about the young lovers, maybe. But the main character was not someone we really rooted for, because, well, we knew things would go his way for the most part. The audience was shocked at the few violent scenes, which are a departure from the usual Anderson fare. Strangely, we liked the only really violent character in the film (Dafoe), perhaps because he seemed less whimsical and was not trying to be funny and failing at it.In the end, the film is entertaining and a feast for the eyes. But do not expect to laugh hard or be moved much. Moonrise Kingdom and The Royal Tenenbaums still remain Anderson's best."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 July 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a great film and one of my favorite Anderson films. He has come a long way from ""Bottle Rocket"" and has perfected his style. The story is about hotel concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) and lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) as they navigate their way through a murder mystery and a growing war in Europe in the 1930s. It's an epic tale that is fast paced, witty, and bitter sweet. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is simply a great story where everything is just what it needs to be. Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as Gustave H. Many of the actors in this film have been in other Anderson films, but Fiennes fits right in and dishes out laughs. Anderson has fun playing around with frames. Whatever time period the film moves to, the framing complements the time period it is in. When we are in the 1930s, the framing is thin and tall like the films of the that time. As time progress, the framing gets wider. It's clever and and meaningful, just like the rest of the film.The film looks great thanks to all the focus on the small details of the sets. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is always balanced and complements the wit of the story. Alexandre Desplat's playful music adds laughs and captures Anderson's blend of humor and drama very well. It is a very colorful film (both figurative and literally) and has the dollhouse composition Anderson fans have come to know. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has everything you want from an Anderson film. Whether it is Billy Murray and Jason Scwartzman or characters with passions or long tracking shots or childish adults and children beyond their or funny original artwork, it's all there. Anderson has perfected his craft and this film shows it. This is one of my favorite films of the year and I hope it isn't forgotten about when awards season comes. It's a funny and meaningful story with characters that you get attached to. Anderson takes you to other worlds and engages you with tales and characters that aren't afraid to be original. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a movie that I think everyone can enjoy and I'm glad it is getting recognized."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2014,8/10,"Film is often compared to dreams, after all Hollywood us called the ""dream factory"", leading us into strange lands that often only exist as long as the lights are low and the projector is running. So it is only fitting that the world's largest film festival would open with an elaborate and visually overwhelming dream. Such is Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, telling the story of Zero, a lobby boy at a luxury hotel in a pre-war fantasy state who is mentored by the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave and plunges into an epic adventure with him. The film is a brightly colored tour de force, hilariously funny, a crazy comic book world full of strange and enchanting creatures. A passing, temporary world in which one can, for a short time, live or at least imagine a dream life. Like a hotel. The visuals are astounding, the story-telling, fast-paced, inventive, always surprising, the characters quirky, grotesque, lovable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a gigantic and excessively sweet candy floss kind of a movie full of a stellar cast on the edge of quirkiness, a wildly entertaining ride that fully exploits film's ability to create fantasy worlds that still manage to lay bare hints of the world we know. For despite all the colorfulness, the film also tells the story of a world threatened by war and violence, a dream long turned into nightmare. The Grand Budapest Hotel has its redundancies (such as the present day framing story) but it is a beautiful homage to the past we have lost but are encouraged to re- create and create anew with the greatest gift we have: imagination. And ultimately, it is a tribute to that wonderful dream machine we call cinema filled with hints and associations for those who want to find them (down to such a detail as the aspect ratio) – albeit one that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which might be its most charming and enchanting quality.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2020,10/10,"Wes Anderson is one of the few directors working today who understands the importance of aesthetics in making a good movie. As someone who can't enjoy a movie if I don't like how it looks, his perfectly designed, retro-flavoured sets are a real boon in this age of harsh lighting, muddled camerawork, and gratuitous cgi. I love his movies even though they're mostly in genres that don't normally interest me. Highly recommended, unless you're one of those people who thinks that Marvel movies are great cinema."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 February 2021,8/10,"This is a great movie with great cinematography starring Ralph Fiennes as Gustav and brilliant director Wes Anderson. In this film, we see an imaginary city with imaginary characters that are well watered. Be sure to recommend it. 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 April 2020,10/10,"Visually and technically stunning, gracefully lathered with acute attention detail, both by imagery and description, accompanied by a unique and brillant sense of perfectly timed humor, immaculate storytelling, a plethora of extremely witty and memorable performances and dialogue, The Grand Budapest Hotel paints a remarkable portrait of an exceptional occurrence with a truly distinctive style. With marvelous shot composition, framework, and symmetry. Wes Anderson has made a masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 December 2014,5/10,"It was actually painful to watch the entire film. I can see that it's trying to be funny but wasn't actually funny. It felt like the director is trying to say ""Hey, this is where you're supposed to laugh!"". Black comedy is hard to pull off and I'd say this one failed... with me at least.The number of big name casting and cameo didn't help either. And not needed. Each of them didn't have any ""performances"" so to speak. Just ""appearances""But even with everything aside, the story just isn't that interesting. If you peel off all the glamours and colors, the basic story is so... basic and uninteresting. And it just felt like the director tried to dress it up with actors and colorful editing. In a way, it felt like an ordinary girl putting on lots and lots of makeup."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 June 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson is really consistent with crafting extremely well-made films. His awesome attention to detail and how he shoots his movies won me over with Moonrise and now, with, GBH I'm convinced Wes Anderson is one of the best, original directors we have today. There's a lot going on in this movie: A girl is visiting a memorial and reading a book by a Nameless Author. Meanwhile, the Author narrates this book for us about a lonely hotel owner who then tells the Author a story about his start as a young Lobby Boy being trained by the then hotel concierge. There's a painting theft, a ski chase, a great and suspenseful museum foot chase. This movie is on through the entire time. When it's not giving you a scene filled with great dialog from it's wonderful cast, you're admiring the typically beautiful set design. The script does a great job of using each setting in the movie and throwing in some surprisingly intense sequences. That museum scene is my favorite and there's awesomely shot shootout at the end that kind acts as a cherry on top of the sundae. The dream team cast is near perfect, as with all Wes Anderson movies. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant and carries the movie IMO, any man that can go from the evil Dark Lord to leading a comedy and nailing it is aces in my book. There's a lot of cool smaller roles, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum stand out. Again this film is technically flawless as well. The cinematography and music fit well and direction is perfect. I easily recommend a purchase for Wes Anderson and film fans. Casual movie goers might enjoy a rental."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2015,9/10,"I usually don't like Wes Anderson films but I truly enjoyed this one. I understand what Anderson has been trying to do by creating self contained worlds for a story to be told, but I found his past efforts failed because the set design and acting were simply not good enough. For this type of thing to work everything has to be 100% great. Most of the previous productions were OK and a person could sit there and enjoy playing make pretend, but to realize such a peculiar individual vision everything must be spot on. In Grand Budapest Hotel there seem to have been no holds barred and it's obvious that a greater than usual amount of effort went into its realization. Every bit of the story has many layers of narration that depend upon each other to tell the tale, and the viewer has a fantastic time connecting all the bits together. It's fun to watch this film and it presents beautifully. It's nice to see this director hitting his stride."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 May 2020,10/10,"A delightful, very touching and ultimately sweet film. I am watching it tonight for the 5th time- and am as every bit as enchanted as the first time I saw it. Don't miss it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 December 2014,2/10,"I have a fantasy. Sometimes I imagine a film festival, not necessarily Oscars, just a festival. There are some nominees for awards of course. Then it comes to announce the winner, the hostess announces that no movie won the award as none were good enough to be worthy of consideration! It may be my fantasy but it reflects the reality of the movie business. Mind blowing movies are endangered breed these days and film festivals to continue their game are choosing between crap and crappier to award something to someone. Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the much debated movies of 2014 and won some awards, most likely it will find its way on Oscars too but does it deserve the buzz? The answer is BIG NO! The story is plain boring with with no emotional or mystery factor to encourage audience to watch it without getting bored till the end. Character development is crude and senseless. Cinematography is cheesy at best and there are insanely stupid mistakes/deficiencies in production such as English writing on everything even the temporary passport instead of German or Magyar! Seriously! LOBBY BOY???? Was it a movie or Pink Panther cartoon? Or maybe they taught the audience is illiterate and stupid! Young Mr Moustafa is very dark. Old Mr Moustafa is white! Hair gets grey by age but the skin only gets darker not whiter! The story is supposed to happen in year 1930 something. The Austria-Hungry empire has been collapsed for 15 years and yet in Captain Henckel's office (The police chief) we see the picture of emperor Franz Joseph of Habsburg dynasty and numerous other mistakes and deficiencies. I wonder how they managed to lure all these big names into an insanely stupid movie like this? And also I have zero ability to understand why critics acclaimed this movie. I would say a watchable movie, do not expect ""Grand Hotel"" out of it, just a movie to watch and maybe go to sleep in the middle. 2/10!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 September 2014,10/10,"I just saw THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL! The new Wes Anderson movie has a lot to talk about and in all honesty, I don't know where to begin! In a nutshell, SEE IT! I could honestly gush for an hour about the visuals and the art direction and the cinematography or the story, which is honestly some of the finest and funniest writing I have ever seen in any film bar none, or the acting which is superb and brimming with fun cameos. It's like a dream to watch. It really reminds me of a lot of those classic comedies like Around the World in 80 Days or The Pink Panther or The Great Race Every frame(and I mean EVERY frame) of this film is so beautifully and carefully put together that every second of it looks like art. This is one I'll be watching at least once more in the theater as it's absolutely flawless! The Grand Budapest Hotel EARNS a PERFECT 5...out of 5!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 September 2019,10/10,"Set in a fictional location and hotel of Eastern Europe during World War Two, "" The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a fast moving, hilariously funny, occasionally dark film told in flashback as the aged former owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel tells his story to a young writer. Featuring a great ensemble acting cast. Highly recommended."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 March 2021,8/10,"I have long held a tumultuous disposition towards Wes Anderson's unique cinematic style. Cutting when the camera should pan, panning when the camera should cut, splitting his movies into chapters, and choosing distractingly vibrant color pallets, Wes tends to be a bit too flashy for my taste. Nevertheless, despite it still sporting all of these Wes-isms, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an undeniable gem.Anderson's eighth feature, ""Budapest Hotel"" is a (double) framed narrative told over a 1968 dinner at the titular establishment. Aging hotel owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) tells an unnamed visiting writer (Jude Law) the tale of how he first came to the Grand Budapest in 1932 and served as a bellboy under the hotel's infamous then-owner, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).After M. Gustave's late mistress (Tilda Swilton) leaves him a priceless painting in her will, the family suspects him of manipulating or even murdering her. Rather than wait for the will to be verified, Gustave and a young Zero (Tony Revolori) decide to steal the artwork. What follows is a wild adventure involving bounty hunters, prison breaks, romance, friendship, and tobogganing down an enormous European mountain.For everything wonderful about this film, it is Fiennes who steals the show. Gustave is an enigmatic anti-protagonist. At times he is admirable and at others appalling, but for the audience, he is wholly entertaining. It is nonstop fun to watch Fiennes break from his regular villain roles to play this larger-than-life hotel manager, who nevertheless delights through comedic subtlety.Fiennes also has wonderful chemistry with the reserved yet stellar Revolori. It is not a funny-straight man match up, but rather a burlesque master-apprentice relationship where the master (Gustave) is undeniably the more ridiculous. Both characters are ""straight,"" but Gustave gets himself in more outlandish situations where watching him retain his squeaky-clean demeanor becomes a source of laughter.Outside of Fiennes and Revolori's dynamic duo, the regular Wes Anderson actors makes appearances. Willem Defoe, Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and Owen Wilson all pop up as expected. Meanwhile, Harvey Keitel has a brief cameo while Adrian Brody and Saoirse Ronan play more integral parts. It feels like a big, all-star Anderson reunion surrounding freshmen Fiennes and Revolori at the story's center.Moreover, I must admit that I even came to like the style in ""Budapest Hotel."" Unlike many of Anderson's other movies, this one takes place in the fictional country of Zubrowka. Therefore, I had an easier transition into Wes's Wacky World, willing to suspend disbelief and appreciate that I am somewhere outside of the familiar universe.With that in mind, I could better appreciate the film's artistry. Despite its rich colors and sounds, it actually reminded me of early silent pictures from F.W. Murnau or even Georges Méliès. The sets are unapologetically fabricated with miniatures, and the aspect ratio is archaically square. Given that the film's bulk takes place in the 1930s, this felt tellingly transportive. For the first time in a live action Wes Anderson film, I found myself deeply relishing in the director's artistic liberties."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,10/10,"Movie making at its absolute brilliant best, using all the elements that were central to the art in the period in which it is predominantly set, the early 30s. This was only 5 years into the era of the 'talkies' and the acting was emphatic, the dialogue crisp. No special effects, but cute little models depicting the scene, even the gorgeous wedding-cake facade of the hotel itself. And it was eastern Europe epitomised to perfection. My ancestral roots are in that region, and I saw so many of the quirky mannerisms that populated my distant childhood, those of relatives now long gone who were young adults there in the 30s. I loved Mendl's - pure Viennese Konditorei, with their little pink boxes that so much 'belonged' that I could taste the chocolate, cream and marzipan.The plot screamed ""suspend disbelief"", and it's sad that the 'hated it' brigade on here couldn't figure this - obviously they find 'Avatar' more realistic! The acting - well Ralph Fiennes overwhelmingly carried the scene, and if he (and also the movie and director) don't walk off with little statuettes there's something very wrong with the system. But Zero both young and old were terrific, and I see a 'best supporting' for the boy with the pencil-thin moustache.Some movies, despite their brilliance, are ones you see just a single time. This one I could watch over and over, and I am sure each time I would spot delightful little things I missed before. It is such an exquisite confection - a Mendl's pastry wrapped up in a cubic pink box and tied with a bright blue ribbon. Yum-yum!!!!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 July 2014,7/10,"I have a love and hate relationship when it comes to Wes Anderson films. Some of his movies come across as absolutely incredible to me (Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox) and others are mostly forgettable (Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), that being said, I haven't actually seen all of his movies but I had to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel since it has been helmed as one of the best movies of the year. And is it the best movie of the year? No, not really. Is it pretty good though? Absolutely. The movie doesn't stray away from Wes Anderson's style whatsoever and every single shot of the movie is absolutely incredible to look at. Listen, I don't think too many people complain about how great looking a Wes Anderson movie is. They are always absolutely gorgeous from the way the camera moves to the way each shot is framed to the color palette, everything is incredible as per usual and I think Budapest is probably his most beautiful film to date. My issues with Budapest more so come from the characters lacking real depth or emotional resonance as well as how overstuffed the movie is. The movie already begins in jumbled mess considering it has four separate timelines. One in present day with a teenage girl looking at a monument of a writer simply known as ""The Author"" (Tom Wilkinson) and she begins to read his memoir near the monument. It then jump backwards to 1985 and we see The Author who begins narrating a story about a time when he went to the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968. The hotel is in a poor state at this point and doesn't have very many guests but The Author encounters Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) and Zero begins to tell the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel, which then brings us to the year 1932 and is the main timeline of the film. The first timeline with the teenage girl is utterly pointless and seems to serve no purpose other than making the reference to Stefan Zweig a bit more evident. The timeline of the author in 1985 also serves no purpose. The only two timelines that are important are at least the ones prominently featured: 1968 and 1932. I would have preferred better connective pieces to all these timelines to string them all together otherwise it just comes across as kind of pointless.We are still mostly taken through the story in 1932 (with 4:3 framing that I actually quite appreciated visually, Anderson uses it to his advantage in every shot), which really takes the viewer through the hotel in the glory days with Zero as a young lobby boy and Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) as the concierge of the hotel. Fiennes is really the carrier of this film, he keeps it entertaining and has the most well established sense of wit out of anyone in the cast and is sadly, one of the only really well developed characters. We are loaded with great actor after great actor (Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, etc.) but they seem to serve no purpose other than to be like ""hey look at these actors we got for this movie. They won't serve much of a purpose in the movie but who doesn't like Bill Murray?"" Some much wasted talent all at once to simply serve in places where many other lesser actors could have filled the role. Very few characters as a whole are developed but at the very least, the story is outrageous enough and beautiful to look at to keep it from losing too much artistic and entertainment value. The movie has jail time in it, murder, people losing fingers, sledding, a bunch of priests in the mountains, etc, plenty of weird, quirky, Wes Anderson stuff (I mean that in a good way). Budapest is not a bad film by any means; simply the reception of the film has been a bit overstated in my eyes. I'll say it again, the movie is so incredibly beautiful visually but the characters lack much development beyond being there to rattle off Wes Anderson quirks (which are admittedly fun to hear and watch) and that is a real shame and disappointment to a movie that I think if more time was spent on writing good characters, the movie as a whole could have been better. Certainly worth watching for the visuals alonebut don't expect characters or a story that is really going to stick with you (despite how weird and fun and quirky the story might be)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 May 2021,8/10,"That was honestly much more creative than I expected. It's the first Wes Anderson film I've watched, btw, and I gotta say - it was so unique, fun and refreshing.In The Grand Budapest Hotel we have most of the film told as a story inside a story, which is told inside the film, so it's kind of the...third root of the original story? Nevermind. Anyway, the outer story is told by an author who travels to various places, and in some point he gets to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where he meets a curiosity-inducing person by the name of Zero Mustafa. This guy is one of the richest people in Europe, but yet he's coming to the hotel each season and stays in the servant's room. Mustafa decides to tell the author his story after a short conversation they had, and that's how the film is told, basically. The main story is Mustafa's.Well, that was a headache to explain, but let's get now to the actual review.I don't think that there's one thing that I truly dislike here. The pacing is maybe a bit off in the first part of this film, but it's a really minor problem honestly. I also think that we could maybe get a little more character building with the villains, but they're not intended to be deep and complicated so I guess that they're totally fine at this kind of movie.On the other hand, I liked a lot of stuff throughout the film. For instance, he use of color and the general aesthetic of this film are so unique and cool. The film feels almost cartoonish because of it's vibrant colors, creative cinematography and great, subtle-yet-over-the-top humor (I don't know how else to explain it), and I absolutely love it. The acting is quite good as well, and I find most of the characters very memorable and entertaining. The soundtrack fits the tone of the movie so well, btw, epecially during its second half.This film is practically a vibe, to be frank. It's so fun and creative and colorful, yet emotionally engaging. Highly recommended. Feeling an 8.4/10 .P.s
Edward Norton kinda caught me off guard here, but I was pleasently surprised. This man is a jack-of-all-trades, really."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 October 2014,8/10,"I've never viewed anything like this before. The Grand Budapest Hotel is quite a classy film. It is something to witness. I am counting at least 5 Oscar nominations for this film. But unfortunately don't see them winning.I found the story very interesting. It's about M.Gustav and Zero Mustafa, a concierge and a lobby boy from fictional Hotel Budapest. Their adventurous time together. Many years later Mr.Mustafa, now the owner of the hotel tells his story to a writer staying in the hotel.Ralph Fiennes did a outstanding job portraying the role of M.Gustav, a simple minded concierge at Hotel Budapest without stealing the spotlight all for himself. It's a definite Oscar nomination deserving performance. The young supporting actor Tony Revolori is a new name I am gonna remember in future. Despite so many big names in the cast, Revolori outperformed all. Except for Fiennes of course. The adapted screenplay was super cool. Costume designs were fantastic. The entire cast did a very good job, from Adrian Body to Sarosie Ronan, from William Defoe to Edward Norton. William Defoe as homicidal psychopath Jopling is another part to take from this movie. And for bringing all this beautiful stuffs together, Wes Anderson gets a very huge thumbs up. Marvelous stuff. Well if this movie is so great, then why am I giving it 8 stars? Well because the film failed to hold my attention at a stretch. Some of the dialogs just went above my head. And for a comedy film I didn't leave laughing.My final verdict: 84%. And like I've said before, this film will definitely get at least 5 nomination and 2 awards this annual Oscar."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2015,,"I went into this movie with low expectations - frequently, movies that get Oscar buzz are not all that great.But this little gem keeps your attention and it keeps you entertained. It's unique, different - not your run of the mill Hollywood flick.The story line is as colorful as the cinematography. They paid great attention to detail and developed the characters nicely.It makes you laugh and root for the underdog - it provides enough suspense to keep your attention. It's cleverly written and probably makes a good candidate for watching it again to catch anything you may have missed. The setting and costumes are beautiful and overall, the acting is great.I never found myself bored and I was actually a bit sad when the movie concluded.Go watch it! :)Sept. 22, 215 Update: Note to Self: don't post reviews on IMDb. People who dislike the movie will vote ""not helpful"" regardless of how helpful your review actually may have been. ;)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2020,8/10,"Wow I really enjoyed this movie! The cinematography was just soo good in this film! The set design for the hotel looked so good. Everything looked so satisfying in this movie!
This is my first wes anderson movie soo I of course figured it out that it was a little weird.
Anyways this was a blast to watch with some great actings and I had a shock while famous actors were in there too"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2014,10/10,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--The Grand Budapest Hotel is a unique excursion into a long admired, yet under-appreciated world somewhere between the dark whimsy of a grim fairytale, and startling reality check that's riddled with reminders that good and evil are forever at odds with each other through both mental and psychical manifestations. And in the end, it's still fun!Now I don't believe it would be fair to go on a big rant about how beautiful of a movie The Grand Budapest Hotel is, cause it's just a given that all of Wes Anderson's more recent films have been quirky marvels in the style department; however, completely ignoring the little nuances and attention to detail littered throughout it's 140 min length would be blasphemy to fellow fans. So here's a brief mention of them: wow...art at it's finest! What Anderson lacks in character development for this film he more than makes up for through telling a simple yet complicated tale intricately woven together by a flashback within a recounting narrative. The cast of The Grand Budapest Hotel are more of players in this world than any other previous production by Anderson, and all aside from M. Gustave and Zero Mustafa are treated as interesting but short lived characters that supplement the world for either plot progression or merely as an Easter egg for long time Anderson fans. Fiennes as M. Gustave effortlessly steals the show and stays true to his character's principles, misguided as some may be, to the point that he himself becomes poetry more so than the frequent verbal art he recites throughout the film. Every other character's importance is perfectly paced and nothing feels unresolved without reason by films end. Though their may still be some questions raised, these are intentional, and some are even answered indirectly during the film if well sessioned eyes can catch them.Again, it's hard to talk about an Anderson film without mentioning it's beauty, or for that matter wanting to rattle on about the whole movie for hours, but the best part of the Grand Budapest Hotel is that it's such a gift you won't want to ruin anything for anyone else. It's such a trip and by far the most catch-all film Anderson has ever done. It may not be perfect in every way, but given it's much grander scale and the more than obviously meticulous cinematography from beginning to end, you'll feel it's all over right when it should be yet feel as though it should never end at the same time. Although not a very accessible film, it's easy for me to recommend, and even push as a proud film enthusiast."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 September 2021,2/10,"Wes Anderson is the darling of highly sophisticated story telling. High flying from political satirical humor to world wars and Agatha cime tale suggestions ,
Artistically Budapest hotel , costumes, scenery audio , camera angles and all round production values second to none! !
Bottom line, for me personally , I felt totally numb and therefore had no desire to attempt at keeping up with the so called humor ? Mister Anderson
thanks , albeit in me you will not find me viewing any further exaggerated stretches of pointless complicated ghastly humorless junk...."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 June 2019,10/10,"Damn I love this film.Of all Wes Andersons films this is the one that impresses me the most, a wimsy of live actions with a dash of animation dotted here and there connecting the many scenes & locations.Though some friends I knew did not like it, as I said ""Wimsy"" you have to like that and I found I did.This is a sad but funny tale of the early days of a Lobby boy within the Grand Budapest Hotel, it is a story of romance, murder, art theft, jailbreak and a cast of gloriously barking mad maniacs and oh yes, theres chocolates as well.Maniacs I said, oh yes, don't blink or you'll miss yet another great actor or actress playing a bit part just because its FUN! And above all else is Ralph Fiennes best part in years.Thats the thing funny & sad but above all else this film is fun.So come visit the Grand Budapest, just dont forget to tip the lobby boy;)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 August 2020,7/10,"I find myself enthralled for the 1st half of the film, but always start drifting midway through. There's still funny scenes in the 2nd half. But a lot could have been left on the floor. I wouldn't have missed the entirety of the Dafoe scenes, and he was my favorite part of Life Aquatic. It's nothing against him."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 June 2014,7/10,"I had no plans to watch this movie but heard so much about it, I couldn't resist.First thing you notice about the movie is it's picturisation and direction. It's unique. It's funny. Direction sticks to the plot and most importantly avoids unnecessary details. I felt it typical British comedy. Every character of the film has a true part and not unnecessarily involved. Another best thing is background score. That keeps you laughing. Best used.There are many parts where film picks the top place.Though in the start it takes time to evolve the story, else everything is good to watch a movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2014,10/10,"Wow. Welcome to the world of Wes Anderson, step inside...The best way to describe this film, in a word, is surreal. I'm guessing this may be a theme of Anderson films, having done a little reading. But what made this movie great for me wasn't the cast, albeit colourful and masterfully done from top to bottom (Willem Dafoe's character was my favourite, although it is hard to make such a choice). It was the combination of a comedy-adventure being set in such a surreal and absurd world; that was what made it click perfectly, and instantly.Take for instance one of the first scenes: A man's face is atop a memorial statue of some kind (or his grave?), and below his head hang many keys on hooks, hotel room keys I assume.HUH??!I was hooked from then on. Perhaps the best part was the desperate phone call made to the 'Society of Crossed Keys', hilarious, absurd, yet somehow relevant all at once. It is very hard to pick a favourite part when it comes to a film like this though, as everything worked, and what I thought was going to be a two-plus hour movie, considering the breadth (or depth?) of the story, wasn't overlong in the slightest, further enriching this adventure with the perfect tempo.To make things even better; in this bizarre, surreal and comical world, a long and hilarious adventure unfolds; further, and further, and further, seemingly getting more ridiculous as it goes. This could have pushed the film over the edge, but because each character was so memorable, each scene crazier than the last, I couldn't stop leaning forward. I feel like I have just gotten off a wild, hilarious roller-coaster that was filled with so many unique and memorable characters, so many funny scenes (done in many different styles of humour might I add), that I can't stop smiling and laughing to myself as I type this. 'The Wolf on Wall Street' was hilarious, truly great. But the surreal setting here made the comic element of the film just perfect. In that regard it reminded me a little of 'The Vampire Killers'. While that is a classic film, 'Grand Budapest' is one of the best films I have ever been lucky enough to watch.I must give this film a ten. Never has a film lingered with me in such a way. 2001 is the only other film where I could say, I feel this is perfect, and that is how I feel about this film. I could hear the conversations and laughter as soon as the credits rolled, everybody seemingly waiting for even more absurdity to jump from the credits. And after speaking to some of my fellow patrons, it seems I wasn't alone in my opinion. So not only do I now have a filmography to check-out, I must decide if I can wait long enough for DVD-release to see this again! I really could go on and on about how brilliant this film is, but it would turn into a thesis. Quite simply, every scene and every character was unique, eccentric and thoroughly memorable. It was that good. I cannot envision a film topping this one for some time... but I certainly would love to be proved wrong! 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 September 2014,8/10,"Above all, what makes this movie exceptional is how beautifully shot it is. Every scenes is a pleasure to the eye, be it because of the arrangement of the objects on screen, because of all the fetishist display of vintage early XX century objects (such as a key, or a camera, or a pair of glasses), because of the actors' expressions and gestures, or because of the colours. Lord, how beautiful the colours of this movie are! All the scenes are so colorful yet carefully arranged, I want to live in this world! I think, that's pretty much what this movie is about. Making you wanting to live in that world that got lost in the WW1 trenches. The story is constantly surrounded by an aura of nostalgia, of a lost world (though it is impossible not to think of the other part of the world that this movie does not show: all the contradictions and inequalities of early XX century Europe, the main cause of all the ""isms"" that fought at the World Wars). I imagine that someone spent a lot of time in flea markets trying to look for props for this movie, and I would have loved to be that person.Regarding the story in itself, it is not necessarily unforgettable. It almost seems as if the plot was just an excuse to depict the world in which it takes place. But it does keep you entertained, with many bizarre scenes and many hilarious moments. But hey, it does have one hell of an amazing cast, and it is impossible not to keep noticing ""Hey! Look who that is!"" every now and then. Some of the amazing actors that acted in this movie, like Harvey Keitel, were impossible to recognize; I would only think to myself ""That guy seems familiar..."", but I would have never been able to tell it was him until reading the cast list. Something similar happened with Tilda Swinton. Overall, I can fully recommend this movie. It's not deep, hard to digest, or moving, but it will give you some good time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 September 2016,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is unlike anything else I have seen. And for once, that is actually a compliment. Some people may be quick to dismiss this as simply 'style over substance', but I would argue that it has, and exceeds equally brilliantly at both. In terms of style, this is an excellently shot movie with not one ordinary shot - the cinematography is flawless and includes some very memorable shots. The colours, the music, the ridiculous CGI, and the on-point editing along with every other small detail (like how the shape of the camera lens changes for different time periods) all combine to make a very impressive movie. The cast is almost consistently good, from Ralph Finnes to Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton to Jude Law (although admittedly Edward Norton feels a bit out of place in his role). In terms of substance, the movie has a depth of heart and feeling that many movies lack. It seeps with nostalgia, and is filled with characters that are surprisingly potent. The movie is filled with a large amount of loss and compassion, yet still makes room for very obvious, and sometimes quite dark, comedy (that certainly hits hard). The ending is subtle but leaves an impact on the audience that will stick with you for a while.There is not one ordinary thing about this movie. It is comical to the extreme, and with every dose of refreshing originality the movie offers you, along with every marvellous set piece and over the top character, it comes together to form one coherent and bizarre movie, and a great one at that."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 December 2015,3/10,"So, I've been meaning to watch TGBH for a while now, and finally got around to it. I knew it would be visually appealing and figured there would be some good chuckles as well. However, I didn't find anything worth laughing at, nor even chuckling at. It seems Anderson just phoned this one in and relied on his name for the accolades and praise he received from his army of pretentious and elitist sycophants. I think he really needs to learn what this means: A little can go a long way. He could have reduced the dialog by half and nothing critical would have been missed. And the vulgar language could have been omitted altogether without losing anything. Swearing just for the sake of swearing isn't ""edgy"". Its embarrassing. The one scene (and I'm sure there are many more if I really reflect upon it) that went beyond verbose with its ridiculous dialog was when Fiennes was berating the bell boy just after the prison escape. That exchange/rant went on for like two or three minutes and was just stupid. I mean, garbage like that - did Anderson really believe that when Fiennes apologizes afterwards in the manner that he did, that the audience is meant to find that funny? Got news for ya Wes - it wasn't. Something tells me Anderson has surrounded himself with a bunch of ""yes men"" who will tell the emperor how fantastic everything is. And at this point I'm sure Anderson now believes all the bull blown up his behind and has an ego to rival any top professional athlete's. Now, I understand that directors have a pool of actors that they like working with, and vice versa. However, it really is time for Wes to consider other actors. Does Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Schwartzman, Goldblum, have to be in every one of his movies??? And especially Schwartzman! That guy really rubs me the wrong way and I do not find him funny nor charming in the least. How he's able to sustain a career as an actor should be one of the modern day wonders of the world. But I digress, back to Anderson and his battalion of actors - its like he's got a checklist going and every time he cameos one of his ""regulars"", he marks it off. Wes, for the love of God, get some new blood in there. And as for his legions of brown-nosers and their ""Anderson is God / Can do no wrong"" devotion - look up the phrase ""Self- fulfilling Prophecy"". None of these pretentious blow hards would ever admit, under threat of torture, that they just wasted 2 hours and $10 on this movie. All I know is that I'm certainly glad that I didn't blow $10 or more watching this in a theater. And I'm sure the art/coffee house types will dismiss me as being a cretin who doesn't ""get it"" when it comes to this movie. However I'm sure that deep down they really know that this was sub-par at best."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 November 2018,8/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has a wonderful quirkiness to it that can only be felt, not explained. It is incredibly charming, as can be expected from a Wes Anderson film.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: Once again, Wes Anderson directs with amazing artistry. The story is one that is both hilarious and melancholy. It is a film that refuses to be forgotten. *Editing/Cinematography: The cutting together of the film is near perfect. Every moment timed beautifully and expertly. All the ridiculousness unfolds without blemish. Director of Photography Robert Yeoman brings back the signature style of Wes Anderson films that audiences have grown to love. The color palette is vibrant and exciting. The camera moves are quirky and odd. It all falls together wonderfully. *Dialogue/Acting: Total ridiculousness is what comes out of the mouths of the characters, but that is all for the better. We feel pulled into the world of the Grand Budapest Hotel for how absurd it is and how unlike our world it is. The performances are incredible by all of the cast. Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, and F. Murray Abraham all shine in this wonderful film. But everyone clambers for their chance in the spotlight. Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Tony Revolori, and others all perform spectacularly. *Music/Sound: Once again, the music is phenomenal like in most Wes Anderson films. It has an air of innocence but also a bit of chaos and even some melancholic themes. It is the perfect accent to a beautiful film. The sound design is detailed and incredible. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costumes and set pieces are glorious and visually incredible. They are fantastic additions to the world Wes Anderson has created. The props and miniatures are all wonderfully made. The animation portions are gorgeous. All parts of the film tie together wonderfully.*Conclusion: ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a wonderfully bizarre film that must be watched. But although it is sure to be enjoyed, one may not be able see if there was a reason for all of it. And perhaps it doesn't need one. That is what adds to the charm."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 September 2017,9/10,"Ralph Fiennes shows why he is considered a great actor! You can easily follow the story, you will understand the characters and most of all you won't feel the time passing by... Isn't this the main reason why movies exist? You will laugh, you may cry and next time you visit an hotel you will remember this staff. 9 out of 10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2014,2/10,"I've really enjoyed some of Anderson's films, and even ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" which wasn't good, had some thought-provoking qualities. This one, by contrast, was awful, and to me it suggests he has become ""full of himself"" or is ""mailing it in."" It's not funny, nor insightful, nor compelling on any level. At the very beginning, the worn, 1960s decor was amusing, and overall I got the sense that this was going to be about a small number of ""quirky"" hotel guests in the mid 1980s. These were people who were trapped in the past, but didn't know how to move forward because they had enough money to keep them at the ""luxury resort hotel."" I was really looking forward to that kind of presentation, but instead we are then taken to another flashback !We are then introduced to a ""lobby boy"" and a hotel manager (who is ""full of himself"" and rather unappealing) who are living during the heyday of the hotel, several decades earlier. Now I'm thinking that this still might be about quirky hotel guests, but of a different period, and seen through the eyes of these two (or at least one of them). Instead, the film degenerates into a ridiculous plot about the manager (Fiennes) being framed for murder, then plotting to escape, then trying to clear his name. Not long after he does this, he is killed by Nazi-like soldiers (why couldn't they be actual Nazi soldiers?). The lobby boy's wife dies in childbirth, along with the child, for no good reason, and we have to be told that this happens - we don't see the lobby boy and his wife as a married couple (so there is no character development).There are a few crude jokes, and several murders, one of a cat that seemed like it was something from a ""Beavis and Butthead"" episode. Overall, this was a very unpleasant cinematic experience, and even the special effects, which tried to create a cute and ""magical"" atmosphere, did not fit in well - some were used over and over again, to the point of being irritating. If you are not going to create realistic characters, then there needs to be something compelling. The special effects certainly don't make up for this shortfall, as can be the case in action or sci-fi movies, nor is there anything in the plot that works, such as an elaborate murder mystery. It's not even a ""feel good"" film with a message about ""personal redemption"" or ""doing the right thing.""Now I'm all for ""dark"" films about subjects like ""losing faith"" (which often contain insights one can't help but ponder), yet you're not going to get anything like that here either! As my title suggests, this is a bizarre ""cute"" yet mean and nasty effort, and I gave it an extra star because it's outright weird, conceptually. I was not impressed by ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" but I think I understood the ""coming of age"" idea behind it; with this film, I am left wondering what Anderson was trying to accomplish. If you enjoy this film, that's fine with me, though I have no idea what you could have found compelling or humorous, but if you think it's some sort of contribution to the history of cinema, I think you would benefit from taking some college courses on this subject. If you are a fan of old, silly-looking decor, go ahead and watch the first ten minutes, but after that, I can't imagine what anyone could enjoy about it, other than a few seconds here or there."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 May 2020,6/10,"It's nice! Starting interesting, it develops misteriously but at half point it becomes obvious and thus tedious. The story reveals itself far too soon and the engaging mistery leaves room to excessive absurdity and indulgence. I would say it is still enjoyable, worth giving a try. Overall average in its content, though marvelous in the scenography and audacious in the choice of characters. I wouldn't suggest it and neither advise against."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 January 2015,6/10,"This is not a film for everyone, but, both myself and my spouse enjoyed the film. I find it funny how movies become popular. Anything with violence, gratuitous or not, Sexuality or nudity can rocket to box-office gold. While this smart, antiquated, quaint film will be passed over. Smart performances from Ralph Fiennes and Jude Law. The film, for me, reminded me if the old-fashioned damsel in distress, tired to a railroad tie, silent film. I wouldn't want to see it as a trend, but this film, much like pepper, adds a little spice to a dull mainstream. Makes me long for simpler times...when a phone call happens on a rotary dial, where an actual connection happens. Not like these days, people too busy to look at one another. I won't be surprised if this film doesn't do well, just because of the slapstick and throwback to Chaplin, Stooges, etc. One tiny note of contention, the audio seems to fluctuate a little too much for my taste. Staining to hear the gentle words of Fiennes,while background music crescendo is deafening. I'm not convinced that was intentional. Small budget movie, good laughs, and memories of simpler times. Good stuff."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 September 2015,7/10,"This movie starts off great! Very watchable! Very unique, very interesting. Then.. it actually continues to be just as good.. BUT, then the last 40 minutes or so are NOT on the same level. Seems like too generic. The surprising and unique is replaced with the predictable and just plain charade-y.The CAST is AMAZING! Absolutely the best thing about this movie. Every actor is perfectly suited for their roles. Especially the main actors. Fiennes, Norton, Murray, even Owen Wilson, the lobby boy and others.. But Fiennes especially. He is ""very good"".My real rating: 7.9MY RATING SYSTEM:9.4 - 10 = rating 10 ***** 8.9 - 9.3 = rating 9 ***** 8.4 - 8.8 = rating 8 ***** 7.9 - 8.3 = rating 77.4 - 7.8 = 6 7.0 - 7.3 = 5 6.0 - 6.9 = 4 5.0 - 5.9 = 3 4.0 - 4.9 = 2 1.0 - 3.9 = 1"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 December 2014,9/10,"I wish i went and saw The Grand Budapest Hotel in cinemas, and if it wasn't for Godzilla i would have, but i didn't so when i heard The Grand Budapest Hotel was available at my local JB-HI-FI, i ran down and bought a copy and well now i am going to tell you what i thought about one of the best films of the year.Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is a film about war, love, commitment, murder, manipulation,image and friendship. Wes Anderson manages to balance these heavy themes so neither one out weighs the other and makes sure that the themes are played out with subtly but presented directly to the audience. War is one themes that is clearly present in the film, but is played so well, that half the time you forget it is even making an impact on the film itself. The theme of love and manipulation define Ralph Fiennes' character M. Gustave as throughout the film he searches for something without even knowing it. Love is also played out excellently in the relationship between Zero and Agatha, who have superb chemistry. Commitment is another themes that comes up and is discussed in a few scenes between Zero and M. Gustave. Image and how people want to be seen comes up in the film, with M. Gustave who is obsessed with his image. But the theme of friendship is perhaps the most important, with the relationship between M. Gustave and Zero and the acts of friendship and commitment to one another, it shows friendship as a bond that cannot be broken.The writing was fantastic, with a story is original, creative, fun and intriguing, it will keep the audience interested from start to finish, the dialogue is perfect, Wes Anderson's directing style never gets old and provides a playful and authentic visual experience for the audience. The sets were amazing, the costumes brilliant and the make-up fantastic, they managed to make Tilda Swinton unrecognisable. The acting was superb all around, with a award worthy performance from Ralph Fiennes, and great performances from Zero and Saoirse Ronan, who had excellent chemistry and presented their dialogue perfectly. To sum up, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of the year, with award worthy work all around. Wes Anderson presents a fun memorable film, that doesn't disappoint. The Grand Budapest is definitely in my top 15 favourite films of all time, therefore it receives a 9/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 May 2015,10/10,"A masterpiece of cinema. A respectful adaptation of Stefan Zweig's literature. The man might have approved of this stylish and imaginative work. I've sat smiling through all of the 1,5 hours of it. And then there was that lump in my throat. Some will be uncomfortable with the seemingly static camera positions and the elaborations on 1930s decadence in the beginning. Be patient, a gripping story will develop. What struck me is the continuity of this film. The story, though absurd and fantastic in itself, develops in incredibly natural manner.Everything works out incredibly well. Acting, scene settings. The atmosphere of nostalgia is all-pervasive. ""Hadn't Mr Gustave's world disappeared long before he was born"", the film concludes. And didn't Wes Anderson himself say ""All the movies that I've made aren't entirely comedies, they're comedies and they're dramas, and I'm sure they are about emptiness."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,6/10,"Wes Anderson seems to be one of those Directors to look forward to as he has gained a reputation for his quirky eccentricity and stylish flair over the years. In his new film, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' he tightly weaves together a crime caper that is sharp, witty and slick, but sadly lacks interesting characters.I won't go too far in explaining the plot because a lot happens in the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. The narrative is rather complex as it is handed down from Tom Wilkinson who plays the author who hands the story to his younger self played by Jude Law, who then speaks to Mr Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who then tells Jude Law his times of when he got a job as a Lobby Boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, working for the eccentric perfectionist M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). We then move from the run down Hotel of that time to the 1930′s when the hotel was booming. We see the hotel in a wedding cake style aesthetic, where anyone who is anyone in the aristocratic world comes to stay, and alt of the time, sleep with Gustave. This includes elderly aristocrat Madame D (An unrecognisable Tilda Swinton). When Madame D dies, she leaves Gustave a priceless painting 'Boy with Apple', to the disgust of Madame D's greedy family, especially her conniving son Dimitri (Adrien Brody). This starts off a chain events which involve lawyers and hit men, an elaborate prison break, a secret society, a woman who hides things in her detailed cakes, and unspecified war and much more.The film looks amazing. It adopts the aesthetic which has become the signature of Wes Anderson films. The perfect framing, the elaborate set design, the costumes matching the sets and all the quirkiness and eccentric deadpan humour to boot. Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead. His sense of timing and delivery is perfect. Also, his character is very interesting as he initially comes across as a self serving eccentric, but as the film goes on, you realise he has a lot of good in him. Unfortunately, I felt he was the only interesting character in it. Many of the touted cameos which include Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe play a small part in the plot, but a lot of them are underused. The talented Saoirse Ronan I felt was particularly underused. The intricate and complicated plot felt tiresome towards the end as so much takes place and the dialogue is so quick and sharp, that if you miss a line, you will miss a big part of the plot. It started to feel too cluttered as there were too many people in it and too much happening. It is still consistently funny and dazzling, but lacked emotional involvement that it felt slightly empty. I think personally, I still pine for Wes Anderson's more melancholic tones of 'The Royal Tenembaums' and 'Rushmore'. In those films, I cared more for the characters and enjoyed the visual and quirky style. I feel his films are drifting towards a more silly and farcical tone, which is fine, but in my opinion I don't feel it is for the better.See my Film Review Blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,6/10,"Wes Anderson films have become events. This maybe because he has his own individual style that doesn't bow down to Hollywood or follow the pack. Even if his films aren't always home runs you can't hate on them too hard because they are completely his own. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" may not be the strongest film in the Anderson library but it is a beautiful film that has its moments.Anderson's films all have the storybook look to them and what better way to drive this point home than to start the film with a young girl opening up a book that contains the narrative to this story? A young writer, who is briefly played by Tom Wilkinson then handed over to Jude Law, is staying in the famous Grand Budapest Hotel. Though it seems very docile at the moment we find out the hotel has a rich history. The young writer runs into Mr. Moustafa who knows a lot of the history about the place. When he was a young man and looking for his place in the world he worked at the hotel. Zero, as he was referred to as a young man, works under the great Gustave. Gustave runs things by making sure his customers are taken care of in every way possible and I mean every way possible. Let's just say Gustave has a taste for older women. One of these women are Madame D.. When she turns up dead, in an apparent murder, Gustave becomes a suspect even though she left him her most prized possession, a work of art ""Boy with Apple"". Gustave, with the help of Zero, must secure the painting from Madame D's evil son, Dmitri, and find out who killed her.Ralph Fiennes is someone who doesn't venture into comedy that often. Here, he gives Gustave a a playful nature that should provide the actor enough evidence to try comedy some more. He sells the physical comedy as well as the witty script by Anderson. Much of his screen time is shared with Zero who is played by Tony Revolori. Revolori who, even though he has had small parts in other films, gets an introduction credit in this film. Fiennes and him have great chemistry together. Zero looks up to Gustave and Revolori sells it with his naive wide eyed optimism even when Gustave passively insults him at times. Overall, Gustave is hard on Zero because he sees the determination in the young man's eyes. The film wouldn't have worked without the chemistry of these two succeeding.The film's quirkiness does muddle the central story of the murder mystery. In Anderson's early works he seemed somewhat restrained in the way he revealed the oddness of his films. It seems, at times, that he purposely tries to inject each scene with some Wes Anderson-ness. Even though the supporting characters are perfectly played by some of Hollywood's interesting actors they seem more like caricatures than fleshed out people. Still, it is still great to see actors like Saoirse Ronan, who like Fiennes rarely venture into comedy, cut loose. She also like Fiennes does a great job and should do more comedy.Every shot is beautifully shot with Anderson's precision to detail present. Even a shot of a dessert treat is expertly filmed. Anderson shoots the film in different aspect ratios in each time period. The main part of the story is shot in 4:3 with black blocks on both sides of the screen. This may annoy some viewers but I found it a bold choice that I quickly got used to. The film also mixes sets, miniatures, background paintings, and real life locations quite well. When the movie does sag a bit in its narrative your attention will be picked up again by the gorgeousness shot by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" isn't a terrible picture by any means. There are moments of greatness in it. It just lacks the natural comedic power that similar odd ball pictures like Anderson's ""Rushmore"" or ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" contained. Anderson shouldn't have to prove to anyone that he is different from the pack. We have seen this in his growth over the last few years as a film maker but it doesn't seem like he does."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 April 2020,10/10,"This is the first Wes Anderson film (director) I've watched. I had it in my watchlist, because it looked unique & humorous from the trailer.The 1:1 aspect ratio, its artistic direction and its colorful images make the film look like a mixture between miniatures and paintings... very enjoyable to watch. Even only for its unique visuals I suggest movie-lovers to watch it. I really enjoyed the funny elements here and there too. Ralph Fiennes plays a major role in that. He's great! Often I was wondering: Is his character making fun of the person he talks with? Or is he plain serious? Is he just trying to lighten up the situation? An interesting and likeable character.Furthermore, the music accompanied the film perfectly, as a great music composition should do.Overall... what a story! It is indeed unique and I'm glad I watched it!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,7/10,"Wes Anderson's films are immaculately planned and executed, particularly when it comes to art direction, set design and costumes. If you can relinquish yourself to the intricate worlds he creates and ask only to be entertained, you're unlikely to walk away unsatisfied. Which probably explains why I always feel slightly cheated walking out of his incredibly imaginative, flawlessly executed gems—they seem slightly hollow. To me, ""Bottle Rocket,"" despite its flaws, captured a reality and a complexity that I don't believe Wes has delivered since. Don't get me wrong, I love the unique style and quirky cast of characters that he's generated since ""Rushmore."" I honestly just wish that I could care more, that I connected more with the characters. As a point of comparison, I highly recommend Aki Kaurismaki, who also creates stylised worlds with interesting characters, but with more humanity. He never fails to make you laugh or cry, but most of all, leaves you thinking about the film after it's over."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 March 2014,7/10,"Never having seen a Wes Anderson film before allowed me to witness a distinctive way to tell and present story. The way Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) charms everyone in this film and how loyally professional Zero (Tony Revolori) is makes these two a wonderful duo. I can't think of a film that tells an adventurous story whilst also exploring a mentor/protégé relationship so effectively. In fact it left me yearning for a mentor of my own that I have sought and failed to encounter in my own life. Telling a tale in a fictional country that draws upon the culture and history of several countries was very clever Mr Anderson. It is a great device to enable a slightly unbelievable, slightly magical, slightly silly and overall enjoyable story to unfold without us criticising historical accuracy. Yet still the film is presented in a serious enough manner for us not to dismiss everything a stupid. The achieve such a solid balance takes great talent.I only have two complaints with this film: Firstly, the ending is rather abrupt where very major events occur in Zero's life off screen. Why? It prevents us from sympathising and valuing Zero's story to the maximum possible capacity. I can think of multiple reasons but nevertheless it lessened my enjoyment of the film.Secondly, casting F. Murray Abraham as an older Zero is a terrible choice; not because of acting ability but rather his likeness to Tony Revolori. It is hard to believe someone of Guatemalan descent will transform into someone of Syrian descent in later life!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 September 2019,8/10,This is totally genius work. Shot beautifully and the unexpected plot turns near fails to surprise and the cinematography is of next level.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2021,9/10,"This is a beautifully made movie- the cinematography radiates warmth and wonder. The casts were all exceptional, and the story well told."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,10/10,"Wes Anderson has done it again. Grand Budapest Hotel is the best of 2014. This film shows the genius of Anderson with his quirky, different style of filmmaking. The writing and filming designs are some of the best and unique in Hollywood today. Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely more of a piece of art than ordinary movie. The cast includes huge names in Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Etc. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He really brings a uniqueness that fits well with the movie. He was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination. He has some quick humor and energy that keeps the film moving. Wes Anderson mainstays Adrien Brody, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Jess Goldblum give Grad Budapest the classic Wes Anderson feel. The storyline takes you on an adventure. It is a story that only Anderson could tell. The effects are a bit different than most movies but fit the theme. M. Gustave (Fiennes) and his story will make you appreciate Anderson in a new way. By far the best of 2014."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 March 2014,7/10,"The plot in Anderson's newest movie starts in 1968, at a hotel which was once luxurious, but has few guests now. By the way, there has been a communist take-over of this fictive country, but the old owner is still tolerated as owner and tells an author his story.He was a lobby boy once, trained by the glamorous and mystical M. Gustave. He took good care of the guests in the 30s. In some ways a little too good for his own safety.OK. Lots of colors, a big cake, fantastic adventures, but it's pictures at the cost of the story line, which you lose rather fast, although it isn't that complicated."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 April 2021,5/10,I'm not a Wes Anderson fan. I find his style to be too much. The most interesting thing about his movies is the production design. Other than that the writing style seems very childish. I don't like his stories or how he directs his actors. And this movie is no exception. It feels like a cross between a cartoon and a play. And I don't particularly like cartoons or plays. The only thing it has going for it is its unique style but that can only hold my attention for so long. It is a dreadfully boring story told in a dreadfully boring way. Not a fan. And this will probably be my last attempt at trying to understand why people like Wes Anderson so much. It's not for me.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2014,8/10,"Years later, Zero Moustafa, present owner and former lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, relates the exciting chain of events that led to the hotel coming into his possession. It all begins with the concierge Gustave, who runs the whole establishment and regularly has affairs with the hotel's female patrons. One of his lovers, a duchess, dies in mysterious circumstances and leaves him a highly valuable painting, The Boy with The Apple. The family is determined not to let him have the painting, so with Zero in tow, he steals it and later winds up in jail. But he stages a really exciting escape, and inherits the whole fortune, which went to Zero upon his premature death.While there was an undercurrent of darkness, the director kept the tone light throughout, making it feel as if nothing that happened was too terrible and everything would come right again. The plot felt a bit far-fetched at certain points, but it was just within the range of believability and I was happy to go along with it. Gustave was such an interesting character - flamboyant, vain, determined, charismatic. There was also this aura of mystery about him, which not even Zero could fully penetrate. The hotel itself was splendid both in its heyday, and at the point when the story was told. Gustave and Zero's devotion to the place made it come alive for me. Altogether, one of the better movies this year!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2015,8/10,"This is a 'Marmite' film. You will either love it, or hate it. I loved it. It has historical and philosophical depth, while blatantly and unashamedly... making you laugh at it's many examples of parody, pastiche and clowning.I don't know how much of it was 'CGI', but the Set Designers and Dressers must all be in some sort of 'rest home' by now. Sumptuous, bleak and evocative all seem to describe what we see.No source of humour is left unplumbed. Wit, shameless mugging and hapless slapstick, are all employed... and with a lot more 'hits' than 'misses'. The 'stellar' cast actually produce a 'stellar' film... for once.I recommend this film, the trouble is... I'm not entirely sure who I am recommending it to. Try this... if you like your entertainment to be clever, charming... and untrustworthy at the same time... you will like this. It might also help if you prefer Monty Python to 'Everyone Loves Raymond'. Even if you enjoyed both."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2014,8/10,"It is rare for one to come across a film which is both hilarious and touching at the same time, but The Grand Budapest Hotel manages to capture that with great ease and incredible originality. The audience is presented with a whirlwind story that shows the adventures of a legendary hotel concierge and his trusted lobby boy, which is absurd and exciting at one moment, and deeply emotional at the next. Wes Anderson proves his exceptional ability as an imaginative and creative filmmaker, as every scene is carefully detailed and flawlessly designed. The film also encompasses a stellar cast of actors, all of whom seem carefully chosen for their particular roles, which helps to create characters that are slightly peculiar, yet very interesting. Not only is The Grand Budapest Hotel visually astonishing, it is also well-paced, constantly engaging and it offers a witty and unique screenplay accompanied by outstanding music."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 April 2014,8/10,"From the poster, the cast would have fascinated any viewer. Except for the ""brilliant new star"", nearly all the names were known to a certain degree to the general population. This tells the story about a luxury hotel which had seen better times and housed distinguished guests (aristocracy and royalty) - all due to the charm and charisma of the concierge, in effect the chief running the hotel. You would have thought this movie a cliché - it is anything but. Yes it depicted (in a flurry) the fantasy ""old-world"" pre-WW II era of wealth, richness and decadence, meanwhile it did not shy from poking fun at the airy, the sophisticated and the snobbish. The storyline was absurdly realistic with a surreal ephemeral earthiness; one felt most (if not all) events were ludicrous and yet quite possible given the circumstances. This generated what I would call ""deadpan mirth"" - hope I didn't overdo the oxymorons here."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,7/10,"There is a bit of the King's Magic Suit Of Clothes about this film. A bit like ""modern art"", lots of people will pretend that they like it when in reality they don't. It is self-indulgent for sure and at times Anderson is clearly amusing himself. There is a similarity of style between Anderson and Jean-Pierre Junet (Amelie etc) but Junet has real style to go with his wit whereas Anderson is lacking in these subtleties a lot of the time. I also had a problem seeing what was going on for some of the time. Everything was very dark and perhaps my cinema has a poor projector, but I have never encountered this problem there before and I go frequently. Also the editing was very erratic - some shots needed longer because there was lots to take in that was relevant to the plot. Others were indulgently drawn out. I think I need to see this film again because I think I missed some of the plot and some of the clever ""only on for a second"" shots. On the plus side, the characters and the actors were excellent. The sets were stunningly brilliant. The story is fascinating and some of the dialogue sparkles with humour. Some of the shots such as the red lift scene are beautifully made and the actors and camera movements are clever before they become repetitious. So, don't expect a European-Quality film but it has way more quality than the vast majority of US films. If you go to see it, I would sit fairly close to the screen in a good central position and be prepared to watch very closely so you don't miss anything. You'll probably really enjoy it!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 May 2014,,".............if it was very good, or a waste of time.Film was touted as a ""comedy,"" but the only people in the theater that were laughing were those annoying elderly ""snowbirds,"" who would laugh at a spilled coffee mug as long as they paid their eight bucks. A couple of light moments, sure, but laugh-out-loud hi jinx? No way.Interesting movie, but I don't think I'd ever want to see it again. Though I might recommend it to a friend, it still falls in the ""inbetweener"" category; you'd either love it, or think it's mediocre. but no one should hate it.SPOILER ALERT!!!!! The elderly Murray Abraham character is supposed to have been the Indian boy you see throughout the film but he looks nothing like an Indian- were they afraid to darken his skin because of Hollywood's PC climate? I'm saying ""Yes."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 July 2014,10/10,"I am not very experienced when it comes to Wes Anderson. I despise his adaptation of 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' and I had not seen another of his films, until Grand Budapest Hotel (GBH).I have now however decided to add GBH to my favourite films list, and for good reason. Firstly the drop dead gorgeous cinematography, which is so stylish and clever that it almost becomes a character in its own right. The angles used perfectly to emphasis the emotions of the characters and give personality to the settings (most notably the hotel itself).This along with the lavish set design and stunning scenery are undoubtedly the film's greatest strength and are amongst the greatest examples of the craft I have ever seen. If the Oscar's fail to recognise these achievements, I shall be horribly disappointed. The performances and writing are also great. Ralph Fiennes steals the show with his hilarious, detailed and unique performance in the lead role. Adrein Brody, Tony Revolori, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan also deserve praise for their enjoyable and distinct efforts in the films glorious ensemble cast. All the characters are written beautifully and highly entertainingly, with Anderson injecting his style without allowing it to overwhelm the film or consume the characters.Finally, I appreciate the film's sharp pacing and tone. It keeps things brisk, light and energetic (I'm amazed so much was squeezed into 90 mins so effortlessly), however still for slow moments of character and atmosphere. The film also balances darker character moments and the use of the film's primary framing device is integral to it's almost dreamlike atmosphere.In conclusion, Wes Anderson has won me over with his masterful work. I guess you could call me a fan now after all."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2020,8/10,"Exciting colors, unique characters, rapid lens, can not stop refreshing. For such a director with his own unique style, no matter how subtle the details, the actors will be happy to accept, the audience will be happy to appreciate."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 June 2014,7/10,"This movie is a retro-style Zweig-themed-detective stylish tragic comedy with a subtle touch of contemporary early third millennium problems. Shadows of people belonging to a previous century materialized by screening a tale old man shared with an author himself deceased to a date recent, about his escape from a birth-country and establishing somewhere in Austria-looking place, lucky to be noticed by a flamboyant single owner-concierge of a popular hotel top-equipped with innovative technologies. Personal strength and physical abilities were deployed in life-threatening situations as murderous kins of concierge's super-reach beuatee narrowed a circle of claimants for her fortune available after being callously murdered by them. Also somehow unrealistic, it's to some extent a funny visual escape from today environment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 February 2021,10/10,"I just re-watched this on Disney Star and was reminded what a work of pure genius it is. From start to finish it is visual perfection, the performances are exquisite with Ralph Fiennes disgracefully overlooked at the Oscars.
If I allow myself to wax lyrical about Wes Anderson's superb piece of work then this would go on forever. So do yourselves a favour and seek it out if you like movies that are a feast for the eyes, senses and intelligence. 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 August 2019,9/10,"Written and directed by Wes Anderson. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (set in the fictional war-torn European country Zubrowka in the 1930s) tells the story of two people: Monsieur Gustave H., a concierge, and one of his employees, the lobby boy Zero. Showcasing the friendship they form as they team up for several misadventures while trying to prove Gustave's innocence after he was framed for murder.So I love Wes Anderson. I was introduced to him by watching ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and falling in love with it. He's definitely got this style to him that is so up my alley it's not even funny. I CANNOT believe I haven't seen this film until recently, it's so damn good. Literally everything about it visually was perfection. The framing of the film, bright color scape, gorgeous sets. There are many moments in this film where I just wanted to pause it and stare at the screen. I'm not sure how much of this film is filmed on an actual built set, if anything was physically built for this I'll be very impressed. But either way I'm impressed honestly.I'm a sucker for good camerawork. This movie has a lot of it, meaning every single shot is intriguing. Whip pans, quick zoom ins, tracking shots, etc. Like ""The Favourite"" it made me drool and I'm not ashamed of that. There's a particular shot that included a character getting into a trolley car and we see a motorbike reflected onto a window with the shade dropped down. Such clever ways of showing us what's happening in the scene without making it grossly apparent. The accompaniment of classic Wes Anderson score adds to every scene as well, heavy strings.The way that the narration is constructed throughout this film is fantastic, it made the movie very engaging while also looking stunning. There's this quick whit to it along with fast paced story-telling. The dialogue is genius. When the movie gets going, it gets going dude! It's essentially a tale of legacy, companionship, loyalty and greed. But we also get this small subplot of a super group of hotel managers and their bellboys. It had me dying! The acting was overall good, but Ralph Fiennes really shines here. His character was so well written! Even though some of the actors didn't have much to do on screen, when they did it was apparent.I also can't talk about this movie without mentioning the superb costume design. I really wanted that purple petticoat so bad! I know the movie got academy awards for costuming and makeup so I'm glad that got recognized. Though the ending felt slightly abrupt, the film is fantastic. Wes Anderson is a master at his craft and I definitely need to watch his other films to fully immerse myself."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2020,8/10,"A good one by Wes, though I really liked moonrise over this... But as usual, the movie has its romance comedies and a fantastic making..."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 February 2015,8/10,"Well shot, quirky, funny, unusual. I'm going to find it hard to cover ten lines as this is my fifth review of the night (I love doing this even though no one might actually read it). It's bedtime.Visually it's an intriguing film. The dialogue is unusual. The characters are eccentric and endearing. Ralph Fiennes is on form. During a train journey -and I assume it's scripted- he breaks character for a second to utter an expletive. Hilarious. Cartoonish and surreal, in a good way. Is that ten lines yet? It seems not. Set in a different era but told in the present day the film alludes to a sumptuous, ordered, bygone time which probably didn't exist but is nevertheless appealing and comforting, a bit like listening to your grandparents talking about the old days - you can almost smell it but you'll never experience it. My grandmother actually worked as a servant in a hotel. How much subliminal stuff is going on here? OK. It's bedtime. Thank you for reading."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 November 2017,6/10,"I think this movie achieved almost perfectly what it was going for. My problem is, that I don't like what it was going for. This whole style of the movie feels so choreographed and unnatural, and I know this is part of the comedy, but it just kept me from really connecting to it. But it actually got better with its run-time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 April 2020,9/10,"This movie perfectly interprets the nature of film dreaming. It is the perfect combination of business and art. It is good news for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. I like gustav very much. Such a person, the earth and the heaven all scramble for."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 March 2015,3/10,"Strip the harsher bits of the language and a few brief graphics, and all you have is a children's story. Add the language and graphics back, and you have a film suitable for nobody.Visually, it's quite bold, but like the scripting, it suffers from not knowing when less is more. I felt like shouting ""shut the frack up"" so many times, there were so many words with so little positive contribution to my experience. Some of the less gaudy imagery, and the skillful integration of the music with the visuals, was quite Greenaway-ish, but please forget I mentioned a visionary like that in the context of tripe like this.Editing was painfully cartoonish. Plot was about as complex as a typical children's cartoon too. Pretentious visual masturbation, not even particularly well done, to be honest - you can see the joins. Best left on Wes Anderson's Kleenex, not my wall.Oh dear, I've just found out that this was supposed to be a ""comedy"". A few bits of slapstick does not a comedy make. Extreme drugs required in order to get any giggles out of this."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 June 2014,9/10,"Its bittersweet story is told through the Author(Tom Wilkinson), who is, as Anderson said in the recent interviews, inspired by Austrian author Stefan Zweig(I have never read any of his works except his biography of Marie Antoinette, by the way). In the opening scene, we see a young girl visiting the cemetery where the Author is honored, and, as she reads one of his works, the Author begins to tell directly to us about how he happened to encounter its inspiration when he was younger during the late 1960s. During his trip in some eastern European country named Zubrowka(it is a fictional one, of course), the Author(played by Jude Law at this point) spent several days in the Grand Budapest Hotel, which was not so impressive to him in many aspects at that time. While there are little remains of the grandeur it had once, the mood of the hotel is not very cheerful, and there were only few guests besides the Author – and they mostly prefer solitude to companionship.And then the Author comes to meet Zero Moustafa(F. Murray Abraham), who worked as an employee in the hotel a long time ago and has been its owner for many years. They soon have a private dinner in the big dining hall of the hotel, and Moustafa tells the Author about how he came to own the hotel even though he was a mere lobby boy in the beginning.Moustafa's old story mainly revolves around him and his boss M. Gustave(Ralph Fiennes), who was the concierge of the hotel in 1932. As an unflappable man of manner and sophistication, Gustave has managed his hotel with style and efficiency, and he is particularly good with his old, rich female guests. Whenever they want him, he is always ready for giving them whatever they desire, and, as far as we can see, he does not feel that bad about his personal room service, probably because he believes that is a part of his job for keeping his hotel in its glorious style.One of his old ladies is Madame D(Tilda Swinton, who gamely immerses herself in full aging make-up)., and his long, intimate relationship with Madame D. puts Gustave and his world in a serious trouble. Not long after her another staying at the hotel, Madame D. is found dead at her residence under a suspicious circumstance, and her mean, greedy son Dmitri(Adrien Brody, who does everything for looking villainous except twirling his mustache) is not pleased to know that Gustave is going to get a valuable painting, though he is going to inherit nearly everything from his mother. While Gustave manages to get the painting and keep it in a safe place, he soon finds himself framed up for murder and then arrested and incarcerated in jail.Not only getting out of this problem but also trying to prove his innocence, Gustave and young Moustafa(Tony Revolori) go through the series of perilous circumstances, and the movie tickles us with a number of humorous moments popping out here and there in their hilarious adventure. In case of the sequence involved with their secret rendezvous with a certain character at the top of a snowy mountain, it is accompanied with several absurd moments as they are trying to meet that guy, and then it eventually culminates to a funny winter sports action scene which merrily does not care much about how unrealistic it looks to us. Following the time-honored tradition of screwball comedies, the movie gives us the climax scene where a big farcical clash happens between many characters, and we get some unexpected laughs as observing the inherent silliness inside their chaotic situation.The movie sparkles technically and artistically. Shuffling between three different screen ratios for each time point in the story, the cinematography by Robert Yeoman is smooth and exact in its movements and compositions, and the gorgeous production design by Adam Stockhausen always provides something nice to appreciate and savor on the screen. Even in the 1960s part where the hotel looks relatively drab compared to its prime, the movie shines with its quirky elegance, and Alexandre Desplat, who previously collaborated with Anderson in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""(2009) and ""Moonrise Kingdom""(2012), composed a jaunty score bouncing around the characters as delighting us.Anderson assembles an impressive array of talented actors for his film. Ralph Fiennes keeps the movie floated along its plot with his rich comedy performance full of nuances, and he and his co-actor Tony Revolori have a nice comic chemistry between them. William Defoe is Dmitri's sinister(and murderous) henchman, Jeff Goldblum is a lawyer who belatedly realizes that he is handing a very, very tricky case, and Saoirse Ronan is a bakery girl who falls in love with Moustafa and comes to help him and Gustave. Besides aforementioned actors, the movie is packed with good actors like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bob Balaban, Mathieu Amalric, Léa Seydoux, Edward Norton, and Harvey Keitel, and they all bring each own color to the film regardless of whether their roles are small or big.On the whole, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a fun experience to be cherished. I was not that enthusiastic about Wes Anderson's movies around the time when I began to be a little more serious about movies, but I slowly started to enjoy his quirky style as the time went by. His characters may be no more than caricatures living in artificial world, but they are usually delightful to watch as they bump around their story, and they sometimes surprise us with the sad, melancholic moments of real emotions. As bitterly reflected both in the beginning and ending of the film, that wonderful time in the past eventually becomes something never to be regained because of that irreversible passage of time, but it is also something worthwhile to be remembered at times, even though it is gone forever."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 August 2016,3/10,"The universe of this movie presents us in a quite significant way an SS-like military formation stationing in a building with pink walls. So why did they removed the pink elephants dancing between the scenes? Because this form over substance picture apparently lacks some clear circus transitions between scenes. Especially as there is this proper piece of music for such a dance, that is played when the end titles are finally rollingThis is nothing more than a pretentious attempt on an art film. A bunch of good and great actors had to be somehow mislead into showing up in it. Humor has the level of middle school students that have just discovered Monthy Python. Beautiful sets crafted with details were contaminated with quasi-fantasy approach. And the whole unrealistic story and behaviors may fit well within the semi-fictional universe, but they sure do not help the film itself: the further it goes the more of tiresome starts to leak out from the screen onto the viewerTo be honest, one must admit that there are some good or interesting moments or ideas; that were unfortunately simply wasted or misused. There are also some masked / reworked events from history of Europe and parallels to today's problems (like mass migration). But overall, this movie should be re-titled into something more appropriate, like ""The Grand Cinema Joke"""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2014,9/10,"I found this movie one of the most enjoyable for years, a delight to watch unfold. Very well directed and a credit to all.In the tradition of an Agatha Christie whodunnit, beautifully shot, superbly acted, excellent lighting and sound, marvellously crafted and definitely for those approaching 45 and over.Sorry kiddies, no explosions, no gore, no explicit sex murder or ""moral/value lessons"", no government conspiracies (sorry Americans & conspiracy theorists) just pure plain old-fashioned movie enjoyment.Sit back, engage with the film and follow the story...A sumptuous production in the style of Murder on the Orient Express, real productions values that would receive approval from Henry Bumstead, an intelligent script with a vastly entertaining beginning middle and end, all come together to tell the engrossing tale of the Hotel's history - but with a cheeky swipe at practically every genre and noire there is: you will start counting them and the movies lampooned, here's a few;Night Train to Munich Grand Hotel The Great Escape Schindlers List The Count of Monte Christo Murder on the Orient Express Inglorious BasterdsWhere Eagles Dareand many more...A cast of excellent actors including Ralph Fiennes (which I insist is pronounced Ralf Feeney) F Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Adrien Brody, Bill Murray (with at last no fake depression scenes), Willem Dafoe, Harvey Kietel, Edward Norton, and even a well-behaved and sensible Owen Wilson, give us adults who know how to enjoy a story without blood, machine guns, mass killings and CGI monsters, a rollicking great time in the style which we remember.If you have some intelligence, movie knowledge, an attention span of an adult who doesn't need explosions and expletives every 30 seconds, and the appreciation of the sheer hard work necessary to make a really good film such as this, you'll enjoy this movie.Darling."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 March 2014,7/10,"Interesting sets, beautifully locations, wooden characters. Too much of the story takes places in trains, a prison and the countryside. I really wish more of the plot had taken place in the hotel. Following a confusing beginning (there is a double flashback), the story took off without any real direction or reason. When the movie ended, many people in the audience applauded. My feeling was ""that's it?"" All the ingredients were there but the cake didn't rise.Still, I'm not sorry I saw the movie. It was different and that's always refreshing in a time of cookie-cutter plots.At one point I noticed that the movie was no longer being shown in widescreen but more of a television aspect ratio. Once the movie returned to 1985 or the present, it was widescreen. Weird."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 July 2014,8/10,"I've always loved quirky comedies. The genre is so full of generic sex and stoner jokes that to see something off-beat, awkward and with true passion behind it is the most refreshing thing for me. Sadly, for the longest time, I had never heard of Wes Anderson. I don't dive into indie films that often unless it has an actor I love or some other person of personal preference connected to it. It wasn't until 2012's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that I was introduced to the work of the auteur director, and immediately after watching, I blew through his entire filmography and all related works. I found several gems, and some more boring pieces, but overall I was filled with joy over this sub-sub-genre of comedies I had discovered. So I was very much looking forward to Anderson's next directorial effort, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". And my patience was well invested.I want to start off by saying that I think Anderson's masterpiece is ""Moonrise Kingdom"", although many say ""Rushmore"" or even this now. But to me, the characters in Kingdom were the most developed and relatable out of Anderson's many creations throughout the years. So I went in hoping that ""Grand Budapest"" would surpass his previous film and become my new favourite. This is the only part of the film I'm truly disappointed in. I don't think Anderson caught that lightning storm in a bottle he had before. Instead this time, he's caught a single bolt, which is more than enough for a great movie, but it's not as great.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the tale of Monsieur Gustave and his lobby-boy Zero whom, while attending the funeral of one of Gustave's many elderly lovers, discover she has been murdered and that she has left her most prized possession (a priceless painting) to Gustave himself. Fearful for their lives, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and run across country to avoid Madame D.'s vengeful son and the authorities in hopes of keeping their fortune and discovering Madame D.'s killer. It's a classic who-dunnit with Anderson's signature twist that makes the film feel very fresh and unique. It definitely stands apart from many of Anderson's previous works, while still keeping many of his trademark themes.Ralph Fiennes headlines the film as Gustave. I've always like Fiennes work, but I always felt like he would never break free of me only being able to see Voldemort when I look at him. But he has finally shattered that mental state with his performance in this film. I will always see Gustave now. Fiennes plays the role with complete confidence and conviction, as if it's a hidden method character he's had boiling in him for years, only to now finally be able to release it onto the screen and give us one of the most interesting and amusing cinematic bachelors in many years. You can never take your eyes off him, and from his mood swings to pointless ramblings he always has an intoxicating affect. You might not understand everything that he's talking about, but you're intrigued regardless.Zero, played by Tony Revolori, is basically Anderson's new Jason Schwartzman. I can see a long and prosperous partnership blooming here. Rightfully so, as Revolori is a great new actor. He has a nice breakthrough here in ""Budapest Hotel"", and while the film doesn't let him show off as much of his skills as I wish it did, he still is always a friendly and comforting face to see. Even if it usually stays in that flat, indifferent expression most of the time. Zero is sadly made an observer in the film, not one to take action. Therefore, Relovori isn't given as much to do as he deserves. Regardless, I look forward to seeing him in future Anderson projects and hopefully breaking out on his own.Aside from those two, the film mostly consists of Anderson's more recent recurring actors that he's assembled from his past three of so films. Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe all appear, along with Anderson staples Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. All these combined create a classic ensemble of whacky and lovable characters who just add more fun and delight to the film. Although I think Harvey Keitel should get a reward for best transformation. It took me a good minute to recognize him.Overall I very much enjoyed ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". I would call it Anderson's third best, behind ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". The characters are very interesting and enjoyable, the plot's entertainingly complex (although not by that much), and Anderson's classic visual style, unique humour, and gorgeous music all combine to make for one of his best films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2014,9/10,"A former lobby boy, Zero Moustafaw tells a story to a writer, who tells this tale of a hotel, it's guests and the outstanding concierge Monsieur Gustav H to us. It's about (blind) loyalty, duty beyond the required, greed, stupidity, love for women in any age ... and the power of influence when treating persons with the grace of that person's beauty. It's (black) comedy at its best. The ridiculous becomes brilliant through cleverly constructed dialog, impeccable executed timing and timbre change. Many camera shots are little art pieces like in Moonrise Kingdom, beautifully constructed with cuts that ad to the timing, visually. The production design takes you from the shabby to over-the-top kitsch to breath taking wooden interiors and mountains. The CGI reminds me of Monty Python, deliberately unrealistic which is part of the humor yet makes it at the same time oddly believable.Never thought of Ralph Fiennes as a comedic actor. He convinced me here. Tony Revolori as young Zero Saoirse Ronan as Agatha are remarkable. And then there were: F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Léa Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, (I think I saw George Cloony for 2 sec)... Just to be able to get all these heavy weights to sign up for minor roles, demands respect. To get them all set their mark in a few minutes, is awesome.""He retained the illusion with remarkable grace."" is one of the last lines in the movie. It describes both the main character and also the heart of the movie. This is a real 9 - beauty combined with dirt, great cinematography with dry jokes and art with silliness. If you like to be amazed, see something out of the ordinary, are able to go with a flow, you will LOVE this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 August 2014,10/10,"Sometimes, if you want to know if certain films are worth watching, you have to rely on which cast is involved. Great actors are usually into great projects. This case is no different. The cast is outstanding, and the list is long, from F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Jude Law, the always brilliant Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and so on and so forth. And then Ralph Fiennes, complete king of the show, simply spectacular in every bit of it. Wes Anderson, who directed ""Life Aquatic""( 2004), or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) is back with this little big project. And it is so because it is an intimate story, yet embedded in a large scale game play, a massive project from an artistic point of view; every character and event is paramount in this little poem. This ""Chinese box"" kind of filmmaking, a story within a story, is what Anderson uses to tell us this tale. It is a classic literary device, and like in literature, it might involve the same issue, namely the narrator reliability, (though in the film the veracity of the events is emphasized), so everything could be a wild imagination from the narrator, which may be even better for the purpose of the whole thing. I'm sticking with the latter, because at the end of the day, a good story is a good story, whether it is more or less believable, right? A writer (Jude Law) begins this tale, telling us how in his young days, he stayed in the decadent ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", and met the owner, Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham), who will tell him how he acquired the hotel, back in the glorious days.What can we highlight in this movie? The cast is amazing, such a bunch of superstars, all of them inspired and enjoying the show. Photography is great, colors, lighting, everything...there is an important amount of detail in production, from the hotel itself in its different stages to the wardrobe, music, visuals and introduction of each chapter. The pace is pitch perfect, a seamless tale that even in a sequence of flashbacks keep the whole together, and so do the actors, follow the lead of Anderson in a way that every single character, every line is nailed, both in performance and rhythm. That is writing, in this case a screenplay, and definitively, that is filmmaking at its best. This is the best Anderson movie so far, is cohesive, compact, it is a exquisite piece of work, both in form and content, his masterpiece. Honestly, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a must-see, a film I strongly recommend not only because of its quality, but because it reminds us that there is always, always a story worth telling."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2014,5/10,"It is not often, that I am disappointed when watching a feature rated highly on IMDb, however I found this film to be mediocre. As is typical for Wes Anderson it was beautifully shot; the colours, the costumes and the purposefully fairytale settings were masterfully done. The acting was great as well, despite the actors often having little to work with.The film however lacked substance. When watching, one could see the effort to add memorable dialogue and action, but it seemed to always miss the mark. There were a few chuckles, but it was almost as if one laughed because it was strange not to laugh, at least once or twice, during what is supposed to be a comedy.There were no interesting characters. The talents of such a celebrity cast were wasted, in my opinion, on one-dimensional, forgettable roles. Even Adrien Brody, who is incredible as any character - comedic, dramatic or both, was given no chance to show his talents.I cannot recommend this film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 November 2019,10/10,"I am most impressed by the story telling: it is fast and propelling. I was almost always kept seated, due to the feeling that the climax was about to happen. This and the style of abrupt cutting between scenes reminds of Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. There is something comedic and intriguing about them.
The main characters are well built, and the acting did enough to demonstrate it.
The visual is stunning, as I expected before viewing. There is one short sexual shot, and one violent-implying shot, which is great. Keep it natural, no need for PG-13 :D
The anachronistic-ally noble behaviors and etiquette of the main character was a fun to watch. (This certainly reminds me of Kingsman). By showing such usually-ridiculous man under such a positive light, I believe Wes Anderson meant this movie to be a lament of a lifestyle long lost in the course of time.For quite short a screentime, the plot does have to resort to plot conveniences to keep it going. Nevertheless, they are by no means big problems, making no critical pauses to the flow of the movie.A 9.5/10 to me."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 July 2021,10/10,"One of the most beautiful films ever made,from the cinematography,to the beautiful score to the great actors...I remember first watching this on the way back to London from Thailand'on the plane,I missed the first 30 min, but promised myself when I get home to watch this properly...I wasn't disappointed a must see film which is why I rate it 10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2014,7/10,"Cute, fun, capable of not infrequently forcing a smile, attention holding; but considering it beyond the final credits one realizes it has about as much intellectual sustenance as a Mendl's confection, which itself, come to think of it, has been known to serve as successful escapist fare.A little known figment of trivia is that because of the extreme short notice Tilda Swinton was given to replace the suddenly unavailable Angela Lansbury, Ms. Swinton was forced to go on set immediately with but a minimum of makeup, unlike the hours and hours she usually spends in the chair being smoothed and powdered before going onto a movie set. Brava for this nearly naked performance Tilda dear. (If not now, when?)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 December 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest (2014):The first question that mostly pops up in us when deciding to watch a comedy movie is, ""can you laugh about it""?At the core of making a ""good comedy movie"" you have to have some important requirements to really regard it as a ""good comedy movie"". Exaggerated or faint jokes can really play a big role in the appreciation of this genre.This movie delivers far from just good, it lets us see what a comedy movie should all look like.The unbelievable humorous scenes and the acting between very rare conversations really sets the movie in a whole other standard in comedy. The movie have literally and figuratively made their own world in writing and telling of a story in that genre.Some short humorous stories were not always necessary in order to add it in the grand story. However, it let us have a other perspective normally by then they are ""should had have"" presenting.Review by: Brendan Resnick."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 May 2014,2/10,"What stands out in this tedious apology for a movie is the succession of clichés inherited from the so-called belle époque, a delight for pseudo-intellectual snobs. To name just a few: the cunning, suave concierge who scores with ALL the wealthy widows who visit his hotel; the upright lawyer who reads out a will to the assembled family (do they really exist?); the 'glamorous', sophisticated middle-European clientèle. Plus a chase through the skiing slopes, following a daring escape from a prison. In addition to the above, we now have some more recent obligatory clichés: foul language, same-sex relationships (preferably involving bisexual partners); etc. etc. There is virtually nothing to recommend this dog. What a colossal waste of talent, time and money."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 May 2014,6/10,"It's gorgeous to look at, often witty, and has a few brilliant casting choices. But two thirds of the way through, the charm wore off.It's not certain now exactly where it started to feel wrong. Maybe it was the nested story within a story within a story; maybe it was the way that the older Zero M. didn't match the appearance of the younger one (the eyes?) Maybe it was the unfortunate things that kept happening to M. Gustav, which were unexpected after seeing the trailers and poster. Maybe it was the shifting accents of the Americans in the cast; Jeff Goldblum started talking about ""Mah-dem"", then switched to ""Mah-dahm"". Maybe it was the that M. Gustave, who is usually quite aware of his surroundings and predicament, was sometimes clueless. When Bill Murray finally made his appearance, nothing special happened. Whatever it was or whenever it happened, it was disappointing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 July 2014,10/10,"A simple, straightforward story of people with very human failings of love, greed, compassion, and desire so beautifully told.A peaceful, lilting tale of colour, laughter, and more than a hint of nostalgia. This movie is most definitely worth a watch no matter what genre you are a fan of.Some might feel that a 10 on 10 is overkill, but as the end credits were rolling, I felt a sense of fulfillment, of happiness, and a bittersweet feeling. All marks of a movie that is beautifully made.To use the most routine of phrases, like Moonrise Kingdon (another of my favourites) this is Wes Anderson crafting a movie with love. If you did like Moonrise Kingdon, you will definitely love this one."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 July 2014,7/10,"Whatever this movie is, it's Wes Anderson. You'll be reminded of that every time there is a 180 degree pan or dolly instead of a normal cut, every time there is straight-facedness in the sight of ridiculousness, every time there is a theater-esque set, every time another massively A- list celebrity appears in a minor role so as to be included in the exponentially burgeoning WA troupe...The story is choppy and riddled with voice-over and voice-over within voice-over, but def hella whimsical. I'm not a hater, check out my other ratings of great films like Rushmore, RT, even LAWSZ...this one was just too much, like the Darjeeling Limited on steroids."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 December 2020,10/10,"The cast includes some of my favorite actors. The storyline, based on the writings of Stephan Zweig, is gripping. The script is well-written and funny. The costume and production design are exquisite. The photography is sublime. The color palette is lovely in pink hues, and has beautiful lighting. All these factors make this film an enchanting pop-up book come to life, which in no way trivializes the harsh realities of war, of loneliness, of greed; but instead, heightens the purity of kindness, and treats the subject with the courageous optimism of Fellini's ""Nights of Cabiria""."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 March 2021,8/10,"I had only seen two Wes Anderson movies before I saw this one: Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle Of Dogs, both animated. But The Grand Budapest Hotel has to be my favorite. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite understand it. But I at least thought it was funny. I wanted to rewatch this movie again for 7 months, and now I finally did. And now, I understood it more.Now, this is one of my favorite movies. It had some (probably) unnecessary scenes, but I laughed quite a lot. This is one of the most special and funniest crime movies I've ever seen.The cast in this movie is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Celebrities coming in as main characters, supporting characters and cameos. This is very fun. In the big leads of this movie, we have Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. In other roles, we have Saorsie Ronan, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson amongst others. Wow! I'm giving a huge ""Thanks!"" to all the actors supporting this masterpiece. Especially Ralph Fiennes, an actor known for serious work in movies like Schindler's List and Harry Potter. Well, this is some of the funniest actor performances I've seen, not just from him, but from any actor.This is a funny and unconvential movie, that has some problems. This movie is a masterpiece. Enjoy!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 July 2014,4/10,"I for one haven't recovered from the dissonance between this movie's rating on IMDb and my own viewing experience. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the rating? It's one of those things that you like it if you like it (circular argument, but that's exactly my point). Many of the rave reviews I now realize come from Wes Anderson connoiss-fans.The positives: it is a feast of visual surrealism; it's a virtual fireworks of movie mega-stars that make for a dazzling show. But when the smoke clears, there's not much left. Decent entertainment, but neither brilliant comedy nor sophisticated satire. The cast of the movie would have been capable to deliver either in spades, but the script and direction fell short."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 August 2015,8/10,"The good: Good story, real comedy, all actors are good actors, there is a blend of popular stars that we all like. This movie will take you away from ur daily atmosphere to a totally different space and different place, a good feeling if you are bored with ur daily atmosphere. It also has some nice xmas feeling within. It also breaks out of the typical Hollywood silliness. The comedy here is funny in the plot itself and the characters are funny without clown or monkey moves. There is a disguised sarcastic mocking of the Freemasons in this movie, that part alone is so funny and worth the time to watch. The bad: Music is too loud compared to people volume, so you will need to up n down the volume during watching. Watch this movie. It is worth it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 May 2021,7/10,"Let's start with simple praising, cinematography was excellent, camera work was extraordinary, performances were top, execution was good and ending was way too mature. I liked the film a lot but the film as a whole isn't masterpiece. Many moments are very good but not all. One couldn't say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is complete masterpiece. Because if you watch it carefully ( which you should always ) you'd find little continuity mistakes, movie mistakes which we'd not expect from Filmmakers like Wes Anderson and films like that which are famous and made with care. Those mistakes are like pineapple on delicious pizza. Although the film was way too good in editing, sound quality was amazing and was a complete experience of an artistic cinema. If only those mistakes were covered and plot in the mid was fixed with less satire and more thriller, TGBH could've been the best thriller from 2010s. Still its a beautiful film with one of best cast and color grading. Loved it no doubt."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 September 2018,10/10,"A funny exciting adventure brought to life by a great cast. If you want to sit at home and get lost for 1hr 39mins this is your man. Excellent acting, directing and production! A weirdly wonderful experience."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 July 2020,9/10,"I recommend this movie to anyone . It's very funny, dramatic and the directors did a great job on making it a great movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 March 2019,10/10,I'm surprised by how much I liked this.Totally unexpected.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 February 2015,10/10,"I'll be up front about something: I don't like Wes Anderson movies. I don't think they're necessarily bad, but they've never actually entertained me. I recognize his talent, and would never say that his films are poorly made (there's no doubt that the man is meticulous,) but he's never grabbed me with anything he's ever done. So imagine my surprise at not only liking, but indeed LOVING this movie.The film (in a somewhat complicated fashion) follows the adventures of a young lobby boy named Zero and the legendary concierge known as Gustave. The two find themselves embroiled in a series of events that threaten not only themselves, but the titular hotel that has become the center of both of their worlds. Hijinks ensue, and I prefer to leave it at that.In pinpointing what I loved about this film, I was able to nail down three things that it has that I feel Wes Anderson's other films do not (or at least no other film has all three.) Firstly, it has a likable protagonist. Most of Anderson's main characters I find either too self centered or too emotionally stunted to connect with or root for. Gustave however is endlessly charming and fun, and a loyal friend to those he feels deserve it. Secondly there is an audience surrogate in the form of young Zero. He asks the questions that rarely get asked in Anderson's movies, basically by being the closest to a real world character who stops and says ""wait, what's going on?"" when the audience needs that same question answered. And finally there is an actual plot and story that is interesting unto itself, whereas most of Anderson's films don't have plots as much an excuse for the eccentric characters to be put in a room together. These three factors added to Anderson's masterfully crafted imagery makes for a truly splendid film.Though Ralph Fienes completely steals the show as Gustave, there isn't a weak performance in the film. Everybody is operating with wonderful energy, and even as things turn dark from time to time the film is aggressively funny. There's a wonderful screwball atmosphere to everything going on that doesn't let things feel dour and serious even with some events could have been quite dark.For somebody who's never really gotten into Anderson's work before, this was just the perfect marriage of material, directorial approach, characters and actors. All the perfect elements come together to form this wondrous film. It doesn't suddenly make me like Anderson's other films, but it does make me glad that he made them since they appear to have been leading up to this."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 September 2014,10/10,"From the little I know about Wes Anderson I can only imagine he is a perfectionist. How else could you explain such a masterpiece as The Grand Budapest Hotel.Visually stunning, witty, seamless direction, Fast-paced and with stellar performances this is cinematic excellence.The cameos come thick and fast as do the one liners and how Ralph Fiennes didn't win an Oscar is a mystery!This is a movie I could watch 5 times and never get bored. It will go down in the archives as an absolute classic!I really enjoy Anderson's style. I loved the Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom but for me this is by far his best work. 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 September 2015,10/10,"I love Wes Anderson's Movies, Moonrise Kingdom was great, Fantastic Mr Fox was great and yes i even liked The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou. However Grand Budapest Hotel beats all of them for the film's Incredible dark humor, art style and a emotional ending. Here's why this film is a masterpiece.The story follows an Author who goes to Grand Budapest Hotel and while in his visit he meets Zero Moustafa, a lonely man who tells the Author all about his past in the Grand Budapest. The main story has 5 parts and each follows concierge Monsieur Gustave and his lobby boy Zero as Gustave gets send to prison for murder despite him being innocent in reality. While on the way, Zero befriends a girl who is a pastry chef and two evil criminals are trying to get a painting named Boy With Apple that Gustave loves very much, but is stolen by Gustave. Gustave and his jail pals must Escape jail to prove his innocence and that the criminals where the ones being sent to jail and many quirky adventures along the way.The film is amazing, first off, the art style is absolutely outstanding, it's aspect ratio is what makes the Movie genius, since it switches from normal to old. The performances especially Ralph Fiennes is brilliant, he delivers the laughs just right as well as his touching feel you came to expect from a Wes Anderson Movie, The film's humor is dark and zany, all done is a good pace and makes it Wes Anderson's most entertaining Movie yet. The ending is sad, where the film ends With a woman going to the grave of Gustave, the main character.The characters are memorable, notably Agatha, the pastry chef and Dmitri, the villain. The film has it problems though but not very big. The film could have been longer, the film's climax is somewhat disappointing, Part 4 is the worst of all 3 parts and the film's choreography falls flat to it's stellar design of the style.Grand Budapest Hotel is the best Wes Anderson flick yet, the film's humor, drama, style, characters, aspect ratio and overall direction is great, but the film is only 100 minutes, the climax is disappointing, Part 4 has somewhat a dumb feel compared to 1,2,3,5 and choreography is linear. Recommended absolutely 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,9/10,"I've just watched it on Netflix, several hours after the Academy Awards gave it 9 nominations. All of them are worthy. All the make-ups, costumes, design, photography, etc., is exceptional. It's beautiful, well-made and all this beauty is useful, serving the story. These craftsmen put all their talents to make this film unforgettable. We could watch it in 30 years, it'll be great forever. Besides, the film is a mix of comedy and a breathless thriller. Previous films by Wes Anderson were funnier, but the story was losing its interest after an hour or so. Here we have a story who's holding it all the way. It's impossible not to laugh even when M. Gustave is in jail. It's well written. In the end, the most interesting part of the film is the cast. Every member of it is good, and a lot of them are really great. They should have nominated Ralph Fiennes for his portrayal of the concierge of this old hotel. He's brilliant and funny and just for him, you have to see this movie. The first time I've seen him on a screen was in ""Schindler's list"". I've never thought I could watch a film in which he's so different and as good. He's a master."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 April 2014,9/10,"Quite possibly Mr. Anderson at his absolute best. It is exactly what you expect from a visionary like Wes, and a mere perfect masterpiece. Dare I say, his best yet? I know, I know all the Wes Anderson fan-girls are gonna cry for Steve Izzou, probably bc it was his most abstract which by all hipsters makes it his best. The less-commercial the cooler according to some people.At any rate, what makes this movie work wonderfully is the casting, production, set, and of course the story. First off, the casting could not have been any better. Now I know two things here, 1) Wes always/generally has the same people who are either main/supportive/cameo roles, and in this one he doesn't disappoint. 2) I am also aware that rarely are the actual actors in the movie, all the ""first-choices."" Well the chemistry between Ray and Tony is palatable. They make such a duo, I would seriously watch anything those two are in again.The acting is so spot on, the comedic timing is genius ESPECIALLY with Brody and Dafoe... seriously it's awesome.All in all, it's perfect.I'd rate it as one of Wes' best pictures, easily."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2014,10/10,"This is not only fun and entertaining, but has a great story and awesome characters. The story is told in flashbacks: in present day, a girl is reading a memoir of an author; which then flashbacks to the author in 1980s; who remembers his younger self encountering the owner of The Grand Budapest (Zero Moustafa); and the owner then tells the story of how he became the owner.The story of young Zero eventually becoming the owner is quite awesome. The series of events that lead to his ownership begins with the death of an old wealthy woman who was a guest at the hotel. This series of events is very entertaining and fun. There are chases, ski chases, gun fights and prison escapes. There is also plenty of comedic, action and romantic moments along the way.There are plenty of awesome characters as well. The ones I found best were Monsieur Gustave H. (the concierge played by Ralph Fiennes) and J.G. Jopling (the evil henchman played by Willem Dafoe).This movie is one of the most fun and excellent movies so far. Definitely would recommend watching."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 March 2014,9/10,"I would consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, however in saying that, I have only seen a handful of his movies. I was very excited for The Grand Budapest Hotel, because of its excellent cast, the fact it's directed by Wes Anderson and just by how unique it looked. After watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can confidently say that it's my new favourite Wes Anderson film, and probably his best.As I was hoping, the story to The Grand Budapest Hotel is very original and unique, some may even say strange. And as the movie goes on, the story only gets wilder and wilder. The film is often very hilarious, with some seriously funny dark humour thrown in there as well. Characters are extremely well written, with the bond between Gustave and Zero being the backbone of the whole movie as it's so well written. The Grand Budapest Hotel features an odd narrative structure that works very well for the film, again adding to the uniqueness and freshness of it. I wasn't exactly sure how the story would play out, as I purposely avoided all promotional materiel so I would know as little as possible before watching. This was a great benefit to my viewing experience as I loved everything I saw, and felt as though nothing was spoiled from watching too many trailers.I haven't been a huge fan of most of Ralph Fiennes' work since his phenomenal performance in 1993′s ""Schindler's List"", but this is easily his best performance since then. He proves he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama, providing a perfect balance of both. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well. I won't get into the whole supporting cast because there's so many who were all so great, but I was particularly impressed by Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous work, you cannot miss this, and even if you're not a fan you should go and see it anyway."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 January 2015,7/10,"Very good, very character based, some great quirky characters and ‎Ralph Fiennes really is excellent in the lead role and the film itself moves along at a nice pace with plenty of variety and overall an enjoyable film.It also touches on a bit of history as it spans a few decades and while a fictional film, you can make a few social historical references in the context as it moves along.There are a ton of big name actors in small cameos on various parts and all deliver in a film which must have been a lot of fun to act on given the strength of the quirky characters in the film and their comic opportunities. Well worth a watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 June 2017,9/10,"As soon as I saw the poster of the movie, I was captured by its unique and artistic colors and picture. And as a person who especially enjoy mystery films, I couldn't not watch it. And it was as good as I thought it would be, or even better. There is a unique aura throughout the movie that takes the viewer into a different world- one like a fairy tale or a picture book because of its cinematography and effects. (Although it wouldn't be at all for children) The color scheme is beautiful and very visually appealing. Although the story might be predictable and the development of it slightly sudden and unusual and even boring to some people, it is entertaining and it was not tedious at all for me with its short running time. There are many scenes that are darkly comical and it's almost like you're in a game in some scenes such as when they escape prison and are being chased. Like this, this movie is truly peculiar and is not just a commercial film. It's beautiful and attractive like a piece of art."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 February 2019,9/10,"Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.
Though the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protégé, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).
The film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction.
Employed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.
Where the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 July 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel comes out this week on blu ray.. At first I saw the trailer and thought that this looks like fun, Was I wrong. NOPE..This film has a very modern film noir look to it but, with a 1960s esc look to it Set as a comedy, it does what it says on the tin. Very funny with a Whit and humour that really makes me proud to be a fan of carry on and peter sellers The amazing amount of actors couldn't be contained in one paragraph but lets name a few Jude law. Bill Murray. Ralph Fiennes (voldamort) and many more to mention The actors make this film what it is' funny charming and comedic Great cinematic blend of conceptual animation and video art mixed with some original 4 by 3 screen size to give it that old time look Amazingly directed and written but a small let down with the soundtrack But this comedic gem is brilliant and doesn't fail to disappoint Check it out 8 out of 10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 December 2020,9/10,"Saying that a Wes Anderson movie is beautiful is kinda unnecessary. The colors, the framing and the subtle details all make it so this movie looks like a series of paintings stitched together.
Nevertheless, the movie has substance to back it up. With quick and witty dialog, it makes you wonder where is it going, just to make a turn once you believe you got it.
It does fenomenal cinema without taking itself too serious, and, in the end, it is it's beauty that makes it such a masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 August 2020,9/10,It's a Fun Comedy and I really enjoyed it. I would love to watch it Again and Again. It's a Pure Masterpiece Art
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 November 2021,9/10,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie when I first decided to watch it. It looked obscure and had tons of famous actors in it, so I decided to watch it in a fit of boredom. Once I finished the movie I was delighted by it. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is beautifully shot and has some of the funniest moments I have seen in film. The acting is great and the music is some of my favorite in any movie. It is truly some of Wes Anderson's best work and It stands out on so many levels that I simply can't explain."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2014,9/10,"Being a fan of Wes Anderson's unique film style, I was defiantly going to see this movie. The thing is, his films always open in limited release, so I have to end up waiting longer than the initial release date for his films to finally show up in my area. When this finally arrived in my area, I wasn't aware at first, thinking I would have to drive 45 minutes to the art house theater that I knew the film would be at. It turns out in opened in the Regal Cinema that was in the same city that I worked at, so as soon as I got off of work that Saturday night, I went to see the late night showing of this film. What I expected was to be entertained by Wes Anderson's whimsy, and the quirky characters and wonderful performances by his always top notch cast. What I got was exactly that and then some. I believe this is one of, if not the best Wes Anderson film I have ever laid my eyes upon. It was such a pleasant film going experience and I couldn't help but have a smile on my face the entire film, it seemed. What it felt like and looked like was your typical fast paced Wes Anderson live action film, but mixed in with effects shots that reminded me of the stop motion he used in The Life Aquatic underwater scenes and the entire film of Fantastic Mr. Fox. The shots were not stop motion in this film, but they did have sort of a model village look to them and were used to quite comical and great effect. The colors used in the sets and costumes in this film were very nice to look at too, and just made you want to be apart of this world. The wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat, continuing his collaboration with Anderson since Mr. Fox, was defiantly a treat as well and even sounded at times almost exactly like his music from Mr. Fox. Though that is only probably because he is in a similar styled world as that one, and more importantly, it is Desplat's own unique style. In closing, if a film could be described as delicious, this is one that should be described as such! :)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,10/10,"I didn't have any idea of the story line or plot prior to seeing the film. I had only seen the trailers and it looked like the sort of kooky film that I often enjoy.The story follows the relationship between M. Gustave and his eager new protégé lobby boy Zero. M. Gustave takes a liking to the young man and attempts to groom him into his ideal of the perfect hotel manager.There are terrific moments of absurdest comedy, taking a stand against the brutish single minded authority of an occupying army, as well as some tender moments and a couple that make you say ""eewww."" The film is liberally sprinkled with unexpected cameo appearances (look for William Dafoe's skull rings).The cinematography has a extremely rich look as well as some goofy, yet charming special effects.I highly recommend this movie, see it on the big screen."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 July 2014,8/10,"Really fun movie with a wonderful cast! There are so many subtle lines, jokes and innuendos that it's worth watching twice. There has been lots of talk about the cameos. They are fun, but certainly do not make the film. The main characters are so likable and so well-acted that I was intrigued from the beginning. That's my M.O. If I'm not interested early on, I likely won't like the movie. There has to be something that makes one pursue the rest of the story. The friend whom I watched the movie with felt a ""Monty Python"" vibe, which I didn't. I felt a Cohen Brothers vibe. Very worth watching. The characters are very well done and the young actor playing, ""Zero"" is terrific."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2015,2/10,"Before I start, let me say I enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums, so I didn't have any prior negative feelings about this director. When I heard how many awards this latest film was up for, and that the local library was having a free showing, I high-tailed it down. Wow -what a disappointment!I found this film depressing on many levels. The word that comes to mind is COWARDICE, fluffed up with CGI artifice. For starters, there were so many opportunities with the material that included issues of race, culture, class, sexual orientation, aging, war, etc. ALL of them missed! All of them treated with the same shallow-as-a-birdbath approach. I truly felt sorry for every actress in this film. They were all either grotesque gargoyles or saintly and scarred like Agatha. If you were to take all the lines collectively from every actress in this film, I've no doubt they'd easily fit on 1/2 sheet of paper. The ratio of women to men was worse than a Saturday Night Live cast list. That said, there was more genuine life in Tilda Swinton's 20 seconds than in the entire rest of the film! This was a new low for LOW emotion fans. The director was too timid to even penetrate the heavily perfumed facade of his main character. In the scene where he's been sprung from prison and is vomiting a racist diatribe on his underling's head, the latter responds by saying how war forced him to leave his country, after his family and town were destroyed. Suddenly Zero is a ""refugee"" and that magically causes Gustave to apologize profusely to him. Voilà! Zero becomes a Hero and aren't we glad we don't have to think about such nasty deep seated beliefs ever again! Similarly, the director appeared to have been too afraid to even use a real Nazi symbol in the hotel, instead going for some pseudo Art Deco/Fascist Lite look. Yes, some of the set design and outdoor CGI scenes were nice to look at but not for that long. I must have looked at my watch 7-8 times. Thankfully I saw it for free - I only regret I paid for parking!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,9/10,"This film is in my eyes an instant classic - and has been produced with a similar eye to detail and atmosphere as Edward Scissorhands with wittiness of a movie as Django Unchained. Yet the theme, style and atmosphere are more filled with humor, lightness and a sense of fairytale - comparable with the feelgood and poetic beauty of a film like Amélie.Wes Anderson creates a lively, captivating and fun movie. Which is displaying and playing with different aspects of the human condition, carrying a deep message. Without it being a lecture, in this wonderful production. A true gem - not to be missed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 March 2015,9/10,"Wes Anderson is an acquired taste. I liked some of his movies and disliked others. However, there's no denying that what he has achieved here is pure magic.The Grand Budapest Hotel is romantic literature meeting the perfect rendering of those turbulent and historically disturbing (or disturbingly historical) years of Central Europe when style and piercing intellectuality had to give way to preposterous dogmatism and relentless destruction of thousand-year-old values. I never would have imagined an American director could tap with this precision on those slight nuances that gave this region I call my homeland its uniquely playful charm and later an air of decay that still smelled of royal patina.The architecture, the set design, the costumes, the mannerisms are so peculiarly Central-European, even though the playful colors and general satirical layer give a whole new texture to the movie, I can't stop contemplating how much time Anderson must have spent researching our history going as far back in time as the golden years of the Austrian- Hungarian Monarchy and a pre-WWII Germany and Switzerland. He, for sure, has done a great job. The desktops standing on legs made of antlers, the crystal chandeliers hanging enormously like the sun on the sky, and the way the 'old' Grand Budapest Hotel transitions to the one in the late 1960s - torn and worn by socialism - are baring witness to his quest for presenting extraordinarily faithful details. Like I was turning the pages of my grandfather's postcard collection from East- Germany, Czechoslovakia and Southern Poland.Elaborate and entertaining characters, playful visual effects paying homage to basic animation techniques used 40-50 years ago, joyful color choices, and it is all spiced up with some of the most memorable lines of the year. My guess would be, a good dozen of them will stand the test of time.Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. A relentless powerhouse, yet he delivers this force with utmost wantonness. Goldblum as Deputy Kovacs is the icing on the cake. The rest of the cast is like the all-star game of the year too. You cannot expect anything else but greatness from this ensemble. And that's exactly what you get.This is a satire however, not a suspenseful crime drama. So, go see it if you want to celebrate life and not mourn it. 'There still are faint glimmers of civilization left in this Barbaric slaughterhouse once known as humanity.'"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,8/10,"This is a Wes Anderson film through and through. It exudes his quirky style that makes the film feel surreal and whimsical. The film is about a concierge greatly played by Ralph Fiennes and his friend/ lobby boy (who is charmingly played by Tony Revolori) who experience crazy and preposterous adventures. The cast is amazingly large and popular and almost every single character has at least one good moment/ line to shine. This movie is fast paced going from location to location, each more different than the last. The dialog reflects the rest of the movie as funny, quirky and memorable. Everything in this film is perfect. From the intentionally detailed scenes to the quirky symmetrical camera angles, everything gives the film an innocent dreamlike quality that few films even hope to achieve. I really hope this film wins the Oscar this year, it needs the publicity that this movie sorely lacked at the beginning of the year. More people have to see this pristine film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 January 2015,9/10,"i recently had the pleasure of watching The Grand Budapest Hotel last night and if you haven't seen it yet i suggest you do. it had an all-star cast including many small appearances by some greats like Owen Wilson and Bill Murrey along with many others.not too many gut busting moments but more of a delightful comedy and at times will leave you a little bored but it's necessary to deliver the kind of format this movie goes by. it's sort of a Life Aquatic, Darjeeling limited, Royal Tenenbaums-esque type feeling. not a movie i would watch over and over again but a movie that i enjoyed to the fullest. i would give it a 9-9.5 out of 10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 June 2020,8/10,"That's awesome! Each frame can be made into a postcard. The score is great, too. This is called a movie, the extreme enjoyment of hearing and hearing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 May 2020,8/10,"Two sincere, free-spirited, and kind concierge at the grand hotel staged a humorous story in the turbulent times.The concierge at the Grand Hotel strictly abides by their job positions. Although they are fond of old women, they are the only way they can rely on them. Because a wealthy lady inherited his wealth, he was framed as a murderer. In order to trace the truth, he and a concierge boy embarked on a difficult path of pursuing the murder, and successfully cleaned up their grievances.The humorous plot reveals the true feelings of the turbulent years. It's heart-wrenching and sighing.Some details are not well understood, because it is not enough to understand the history."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,9/10,"I assumed this film must be good, cause 9 Oscar nominations and over 90% critics on Rotten Tomatoes really imply that is is. However, I like to make my own judgment, since sometimes I do find certain films overrated or underrated. In this case, I have to admit that the critics are right all the way. I absolutely fell in love with this film. From technical standpoint, it is beautiful, colorful, specially shot with an unique feel to it. It combines European art cinema, especially French and German art films with British narrative of a crime novel and with American grandeur and big scale production. The whole film actually feels like an old-fashioned European history film, mixed with Monty Python humor and great visuals. The setting is really unique, little Poirot, little Disney, little WWII. And it really works in this strange combination.The story is really interesting, and yet focused and clear. What fascinates me is how much A-list actors appear in it, and yet it doesn't feel too crowded or having pointless celebrity cameos. I is because many of the actors listed on the poster actually have really small parts, yet all of them are needed to tell the story. There are no pointless characters, and neither of them drags longer than necessary, just to have a certain person longer on screen. All of the actors did a great job and had a perfect comedic timing, yet Ralph Fiennes is the one that really steals the show. He is the main character, concierge Gustave H., whose cold, yet witty temperament carries out the humor throughout many unusual situations. Characters in the film are often both polite and rude at the same time in such a manner that it provokes sincere comedy. What I maybe love even more is the meaning of the story. Madame D gives her legacy to Gustave H., who passed it on to Zero Moustafa, who then told his story to The Author, who would subsequently pass it on to the world in his book. The main message is that our legacy lasts as long as someone remembers it. The legacy may be a valuable painting, a mansion or a hotel, but it may also be our life story, our time spent with someone, our thoughts and feelings that will outlive us if someone is willing to remember. It is such a beautiful and powerful message. And yet, so concise and clear, unlike in films whose complicated hidden message starts to overlap within itself. I really have not much else to say but to recommend everyone to see this film, and to enjoy. It will make you laugh and possibly cry. And it will remind you to enjoy time spent with people you care for and to remember them fondly when they are gone. It is a very sentimental film, yet so funny, witty and full of action that it doesn't come off as too hard or depressive, but rather lovely and unique."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 January 2015,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel can be considered one of the best works of Wes Anderson. The story is about the adventures of a legendary concierge, Mr Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) at a very famous hotel during the times of WWI and WWII. Zero, the lobby boy (played by Tony Revolori) joins the hotel and earns himself a trusted friendship of Gustave. This would seem like a typical bollywood movie filled with love, violence, action, suspense, drama and so on. Gustave befriends a very rich old woman who suddenly dies bequeathing a very precious painting to Gustave. This leaves the old women's son Dmitri furious and longing for revenge, and ultimately leading to implicate Gustave for the old woman's murder. Gustave with his loyal lobby boy and the lobby boy's girlfriend (a pretty baker girl) escapes prison to get justice for himself. Gustave's quest for justice is shot in suspense-cum-funny sequences and finally the ""boy with apple"" painting hangs happily ever after as GB's most treasured possession.The movie is shot on a narrative theme with a flash back style. The movie could have been edited better with few scenes getting elongated (like the initial part when narrator meets a young writer). Also, art direction at few places renders the movie a bit childlike (like the closing scene). All said, this comedy drama is a must watch this season."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2014,6/10,"I found this movie done in a very interesting manner, that differs from most others. Its characteristics are a peculiar camera-work and storyline. I think it's a good comedy,but nothing memorable nonetheless. It's worth watching though, one doesn't get bored I have a feeling few people would be disappointed afterwards. But no strong emotions remained after the experience for me. The storyline is logical, nothing makes one raise the eyebrow, because something doesn't fit. The chosen venues are close to me: an Eastern European country and its hotel in a bad time of 20th century. And the ending is appropriately sad."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 October 2014,8/10,"You honestly have to view the breadth of Anderson's work to understand ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". It feels very much like a relatively over-the-top climax of every bit of the man's artistic desires. As if every last thing he wanted fell into place, alongside the pertinent inspiration and a willing audience. An acquired audience.Many will watch this film and, sooner or later, wonder why they're watching it. These people are not the target audience. Others, in turn, will watch the film and understand within the first ten minutes exactly why they're watching it, and will observe with keen interest Anderson's grand vision of the Grand Budapest and the many overtly and/or subtly intriguing characters surrounding it.For my money, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" remains Anderson's finest moment, but I cannot take away from the merits of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Ralph Fiennes is, in quality and quantity, the featured actor of the film, and does an outstanding job as the excessively eccentric M. Gustave. His constant companion is a young lobby boy, Zero, played with a quiet, reserved charm by Tony Revolori. The cast is rounded out by many big names, each with parts of varying significance and, despite the overall positive results, varying intrigue. I personally regret the brief time we get to spend with Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson, Jude Law and Harvey Keitel. While most of the cast fits into their roles nicely, the occasional head-scratcher remains. Murray's role is perhaps the most obvious.So, the acting is excellent. Working with Anderson's vision, everything merges together smoothly. The cinematography, a long-standing hallmark of Anderson's films, is breathtaking, truly the heart and soul of the film. The plot is flimsy, but that is ultimately the center of the acquired taste; if you can overlook a flimsy plot to appreciate the other two-thirds of film foundation (acting, atmosphere), then you'll have no problem enjoying the Budapest.It doesn't surprise me that this movie has received so much praise. It also doesn't surprise me that it's received so much indifference, displeasure and/or disgust. As usual, Wes Anderson remains far enough outside the widest reaching circles of film making to inherently create a ""love/hate"" offer to viewers with each successive film. While not all of his work has been loved by myself, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" certainly is."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,9/10,"I'm left in a rather awkward position. Having exhausted my vocabulary of every synonym for ""quirky"" and ""unique"" in my review of Wes Anderson's previous film, Moonrise Kingdom, I'm left with the option of reviewing his latest venture as a pastiche of my last review, or use an unsightly amount of hyperbole and hyphens. Or I could try what many have tried and failed; try to use the mere 26 letters of the alphabet to narrow down and capture the conceit and the crux of the appeal of Wes Anderson's movies. Well, challenge accepted.We've come to expect the unexpected from Wes Anderson, but this film is a departure even for him. What makes this a different film from every other Wes Anderson film is its large helping of heart. Anderson is no doubt one of the greatest artisans in cinema history, and he has a truly freakish ability to create his own world in every film he makes but his films have never been one to strike an emotional chord. The Grand Budapest's script has an expedient amount of the necessary ""Wes Anderson-ness"" but for the first time ever, it's eclipsed by a flash-back driven story with an amount of warmth and profoundness I've never seen from Anderson's ramshackle school of quirk. What is typical is the cinematography, colors and mise-en-scene. Classic Wes Anderson. It's the best that I've seen in any film. Each frame is pure, art-deco poetry with a level of calculation I haven't seen since Kubrick. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most beautifully shot film I have ever seen.Before you burn me at the stake for giving The Grand Budapest Hotel 4.5 stars out of 5, let me state my peace. The deep parts of the script are more than welcome, and offer a film that's utterly, utterly original. And that's a brilliant thing. But *deep breath* I would have enjoyed it more if it had been funnier, wittier and not as dark. I hate myself for feeling this way, but even though it's not to my taste, Grand Budapest is still a riot of creative genius that needs words invented for it to describe it.I've had meaningful screen time with every kind of film ever made. I thought I knew my way around the cinema landscape pretty well, but after watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I feel a bit lost. And it's a good kind of lost. The kind of lost that opens my mind further to the vast expansiveness of possibilities available in the medium of film, as well as the essential, simple joy I get from watching. Does this praise sound perverse after I bashed the crux of this film in the last paragraph? Perhaps, but only if you attempt to apply a layman's logic to the delightfully contrary world where cinema fairy dust magics flaws into virtues. Sorry but that's the best I got."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson is, in my opinion, a film director that can present an original story and can actually deliver a fun ride, along with great cinematography and nice humor. I did enjoy his previous film, ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" but couldn't join on the bandwagon to say it was a great film and it didn't land on my best of that year. With that being said, I did really enjoy this movie and can say that I did enjoy this more than I did than his previous film.I really enjoyed the storytelling and the style of a Wes Anderson film. It has this very quirky, weird vibe to it that really grabs my attentions. As fans would expect from him, there are many great shots, great, fleshed out characters, contains a nice humorous tone throughout the movie and has some amazing cinematography. All of the things that I have mentioned above are present in this movie and I really enjoyed every one of these elements. I really cared for the characters, enjoyed the ride, along with how the story played out and did have some nice laughs throughout the movie.There were, however, some surprising things that I did not expect from the movie, such as that the movie really had this suspense behind it and had me wondering throughout the movie of how all of this will play out. This movie sets itself very well and delivered very well on its suspense. Also, coming from my perspective, compared to the other movies that I have watched from him, this movie had some surprisingly violent moments. This is definitely not a bad thing and actually blended well with the story and actually worked. It presented a nice dark humor that did have me chuckling when it occurs.There are many recognizable casts that appear in the film; however, most of them only have very small roles. With that being said, everyone did an amazing job with their roles. The main focus is on Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. Ralph Fiennes is a refined actor and does have some nice comedy timing, as I saw in ""In Bruges."" He really gives a great performance and does deliver some nice humorous moments that did have me laughing. The new comer, Tony Revolori, I have to say was great! He worked well together with Fiennes and really made the character come to life.Overall, the story was very original and great, fantastic moments and a very enjoyable ride. From start to finish, this movie flew by and I enjoyed every single moment. With the nice humorous moments, well-developed characters and a nice storytelling, I really recommend this to any movie lover and to fans of Wes Anderson films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 July 2015,10/10,"Hey guys it's Quinn c from YouTube and today we are going to be taking a look at probably the biggest surprise in film in 2014, at least for me; the grand Budapest hotel. Grand Budapest Stars Ralph fiennes as m. Gustave, the greatest concierge in the history of the hotel, and his apprentice, zero, as they more or less steal a painting that they technically earned in a ladies will. They are forced to steal because of the crazy son, played by adrien Brodien, and his from Russia with love, red grant esc sadistic henchmen, played by willem Defoe. But enough with credits, lets crack at it. I saw this movie back in July because I had 100 minutes left in my flight, so I put on the shortest movie possible. It was between this and a romance called *uggghh* the other women. Yeah so dodged a bullet on that one. But anyways, I literally had no expectations for this film, and the cover looked cheesy and I watched it because I thought it would be a good laugh, but for all the wrong reasons.Little did I know, this movie actually pretty damn funny. But even better then that, the story is a ton of mini movies jam packed into one, which is great for a few reasons. The beginning is a great hotel, then it goes into Thomas crown affair with him stealing the painting, then shawshank redemption in the jail, the fugitive in his escape, and so on. But the great part is that all these sort of mini scenes blend together so well because of one thing, the fantastic acting from Ralph fiennes. I know this will sound weird but he reminds me of Peter sellers in that his acting of course is Great, but the human that he naturally brings just elevates him and his entire film to another degree. It's the story that makes this movie good, it's the cleaver humor that makes it great. My one little negative about this film is there is this scene when the henchmen is chasing down the lawyer to attend the ladies funeral and therefore steal the painting. Granted, the chase is fun and pretty creepy at times, but when the lawyer is caught, it's just sort of morbid how he's killed. It may just be because I was watching it on an airplane instead of a theatre or at home, but this part just left a foul taste. But besides that, there is so much to enjoy. There's some Great camiós during Gustaves escape from prison, by most notably bill Murray, and the chases itself are on like super speed that it's ridiculous but almost makes it more fun to watch. I love how Gustaves friend from the past keeps bailing Gustave out of jams, such as when Gustave and zero are stops by the German army at a border checkpoint. What is so good about that is that Gustave, throughout this entire movie, is made out to be the greatest guy, and seeing that he has friends not only in other hotels, such as the bill Murray character, the woman who dies and he therefore gets her painting, or the German soldier, it's just cool to see him have so many connections So overall, just like the wedding ringers in my prior review, this movie was a pleasant surprise. It had a great cast, dr strangelove esc humor, and interesting story, fun camiós, and as a bonus a pretty great theme song. All of the awards that this movie has been nominated for and won are well deserved, because With a score of 10 this is the second best film I saw all year.If you guys enjoyed this review, be sure to check me out at Quinn C on YouTube. I constantly review movies and James Bond as it comes out, and every new viewer would be much appreciated. Again you can find me at Quinn C on YouTube, the one with the James Bond emblem. Please be sure to check me out and thank you"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 August 2014,1/10,"Having been to a few of Wes Anderson's films, the twee, absurd caricature, dead-pan precious, lush, scenic, cardboard Tim Burton-esque cinematography that many insisted is synonymous with ""intelligent humour"" were all expected. What wasn't is the insufferable, sophomoric idiocy of the story, gratuitous characters and shallowness of the plot, the script, the character development, the entire purpose of the making of this film. What on earth is it suppose to say?! What deeper layers are there to uncover other than it being a madcap caper about promiscuous hotel staff carrying on with obscenely rich geriatrics, murderous villains and relatives, an outrageous and unbelievable jailbreak adventure? What is the point to this wedding cake indulgence of a film, exactly? And please don't sniff haughtily with a ""You just don't get its brilliance/genius/subversion/provocation, blah..blah...blah...go watch a Tom Cruise flick!"" retort. I honestly don't get much more from this film than its gruel thin plot."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 October 2018,9/10,"I've ben a big fan of Fantastic Mr Fox since the year it came out, at which point I was only 6 years old. I saw in it a fast, quirky and symbolic tale whose pacing and speed of comedy is what made it so great to me. Besides, I loved the animation style and the way it completely subverted how other films are crafted. This was the first point in which I understood Wes Anderson.Last year, the trailer for Isle of Dogs dropped, and my excitement sprang up. Even the trailer showed that it still had the same quirky style. When I watched the movie, I will admit that I didn't think it was quite as good, as some of the comedy was swapped for some rather dark stuff, but heck, it was still a very fun movie.Cut to a couple of days ago, where I discover that this had been put on Netflix. I'd never really heard about it before, recognising the title but knowing nothing of what it was about. So I immediately dove in blind.I will admit that it does drag a bit at first, because everything happens so fast that the first half hour contains a whole hour of material. It fixes the pacing a little later on however, and I could finally settle down. First things first: this movie is fantastically unique. Despite the fact that it is live action, it still manages to add in the half drama, half comedy antics that were present in the animated flicks, with the addition of some brilliantly crafted music which feels suited to the era it is set in and somewhat Pink Panther-esque. This allows even the darkest bits of the movie to be funny, and some of the things that the characters do and say is in the area of comedy gold.I did not expect so many things to happen in the space of 100 minutes, but it is so jam packed full of fast walking, dialogue gags and side shots that despite the bad pacing, I couldn't stop enjoying myself. Not to mention I flat out had to pause it laughing when one character got his fingers chopped off by a metal door. This is why this film is such a great description of the masterful way Wes Anderson can blend together two totally opposite genres and fuse them in a way nobody else can. This is undoubtably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Definitely worth a watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 May 2020,8/10,"The movie was really beautiful at first glance. Every frame is like a picture, which makes people forget about it and tells the story. The deaths of the characters in the play are all taken in one stroke, without much rendering, like a long stream flowing slowly. If you don't understand the life of the author of this work, it is actually very suitable for watching at afternoon tea, beautiful scenery, and telling stories. When you understand the reality that you feel too heavy, you cannot watch it with a relaxed attitude. But Gusta in this movie let me know the exquisite life, and I want to eat a little cake."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 January 2021,8/10,"My mother recommended me this movie. I've never watched a Wes Anderson movie before but i've seen his work on some youtube videos and i find it cool to say the least. I appreciate his art but, unlike my friend, i didn't find my self in awe. Sure it was stimulating, and i enjoyed it very much. Was thinking a lot about what budget this movie had. Everything was very grand and there was a lot of attention to detail.
Cinematogrophy was outstanding and i'll give that a 10/10. I don't remember what my friend gave it for overall score but i remember he also gave a 10/10 for cinematogrophy.I enjoyed the great contrast between Zero and Gustave. Very beautiful.-watched with Tor yesterday!! (22/01/2021)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 October 2014,2/10,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is set in the fictional Kingdom of Zubrowka. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) & Zero (Tony Revolori) lead us through an animated adventure involving stolen art work, hit men, a brazen prison break, human greed and - above all - revenge. Is it entertaining? Hardly. Funny? Not very! In fact, Anderson's film is full of horrible caricatures of Slavs, Sikhs, and silly visual clues and symbols (e.g. the dead cat, ""Guard Bunk Room"", the Society of Crossed Keys, to name a few). The ending is predictable and the acting is quite uneven (Cameo appearances by Tilda Swinton & Bill Murray do little to save this one from ignomy). The kingdom has spawned a Trip Adviser site where you can post fictional reviews of this fictional property: http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g6840479-d6776131-Reviews- The_Grand_Budapest_Hotel-The_Republic_of_Zubrowka.html"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 February 2014,7/10,"A clear masterpiece of the sunrise. Most pictures are made for the nighttime ritual of popcorn o.d.'s and soda rushes. Not this. Some wink. When a masterpiece is a masterpiece, it's one watched in the dawn of the day and far from beyond enjoyed ... but entranced and deeply inspired, opening of your imaginative soul, releasing and easily creating movies of your own in such simple touch and a stare down, eye to eye, with the majestic yet petite beauty of the world. Not only sets the tone, but really plunges into you. Unnoticed when experienced. Only a whistling excitement throughout. The side-effects will carry on, and plunge to a divinely emotional realm inside the soul. A place without measure, without detection or perfections. It is a place where nothing is everything, and everything is heart-rendering. Hiccups of emotion, from burst inspirations endless. Deep down, one by one, & piece by piece, unravelling empowered moments of the movie in your head. Those are the most unforgotten days in life. Our unfortunate lack of patience and time is shameful. The feeling of inspiration is inhuman, thus unreal and sarcastic in the moment. It's in spirit. And that's what this film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, does. Bow down and surrender, for all and for everything. The journey this cinema bares to reach within us, is the journey of the divine, and is worth more than such time. ""All this is true because it rhymes."" ...and back again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 July 2014,5/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is written and directed by Wes Anderson,starring Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder. This is the premise for the movie, but to watch it was boring. The movie is filmed as if you are watching a play inside a dollhouse, if that makes any sense. The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time. This definitely isn't a movie for the masses, and that being said, isn't a movie that an average movie goer will enjoy. For some that's a good thing maybe, but for me this wasn't entertaining. Be your own judge."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2015,8/10,"It's a great movie, with a scenic ensemble very coherent and beautiful (a Portuguese was part of the art team) and altogether a very good exercise in visual experiments, away from the very current CGI.I believe it is a must see.Ralph Fiennes plays a very interesting hotel manager, trying to satisfy its guest's every needs, making them feel as a part of family. The Grand Budapest Hotel's family. Several Oscar award winners complete the roster with quality and efficiency.I particularly liked Mathieu Amalric, as the mysterious and helpful Serge X., and the small part of Léa Sedoux, the newest bond girl.The 2015 Oscars were well awarded in this case."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 December 2014,,"This film has joined my list of brilliant filmmaking. I had been waiting to see Wes Anderson's latest project from the moment it was announced. To describe the plot would be difficult. Wes Anderson is an acquired taste, but his fans are likely to love everything he releases. The Grand Budapest Hotel has the same tongue-in-cheek tone of his previous films, but it's really dry and very funny. Every frame is beautifully composed and an image of beauty.The cast was just great and the throwaway lines are very witty. I have watched it about 3 times now and I still laugh at all the clever nuances in the movie. I love the fact that Grand Budapest building is ""pink"" which a favorite color of mine. Sweet, funny and thoughtful movie. Original, funny, and great dialog. Very enjoyable. Just suspend a bit of logic and go with it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 September 2015,9/10,"Watching one of Wes Anderson's films is like calling in sick and spending the day in your room, watching old movies, listening to your favorite records, and refusing to even think about work the next day.His films take place in a universe all their own, where quirky, big-hearted man-children like ""Rushmore""'s Max Fischer and ""The Life Aquatic""'s Steve Zissou ignore the real world and live on their own terms. Gustave H., the hero of Anderson's latest film, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", runs the titular hotel as his own private universe of old-world class and glamour. He invites us in, and the tour of his world is one of the most charming, funny, defiantly original films to come out in a long time.The film is told through the eyes of Zero Moustafa, the hotel's ""lobby boy"", as he learns the hotel business from his boss, the enigmatic, perfectly polished Gustave H. Zero and Gustave go on a series of improbable adventures - everything from organizing a prison break to stealing a priceless painting from a band of fascists - and come to depend on each other as compatriots, accomplices and surrogate family. It's been a long time since I've had this much fun watching a movie. Gustave and Zero are totally original, absolutely lovable protagonists, impossible not to root for as they tramp through a series of weird, silly, drop-dead funny adventures. It's a rare movie that can be charming, funny, exciting and bitingly ironic at the same time, but ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" pulls it off. It put a big, goofy smile on my face, and a movie that can do that has my seal of approval.Ralph Fiennes is the perfect choice for Gustave, playing him as an overgrown child who turns the hotel into a shield from the real world that has fallen so short of the world in his head. Tony Revolori as Zero is an ideal match, the straight man to Gustave's wild card. The supporting cast is great, as well: Saoirse Ronan is sweet as Zero's girlfriend, the ever-reliable Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzmann are hilarious as members of Gustave's secret society of hotel workers, and a heavily made up Tilda Swinton is priceless as a batty, elderly heiress whom Gustave, er, ""befriends"".The key to enjoying Anderson's films is to immerse oneself in the fantasy world he has created. Everyone has a closet romantic inside them somewhere, and Anderson is a master of bringing it out of even the most hardened ""grownup"". With ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", he creates a world that could only exist inside the overheated imaginations of children of all ages. It's a wonderful place to be.Sometimes you need to take a day to hide away in your room and crawl up into your own imagination. When that need arises, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" hits the spot."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 September 2016,10/10,"One of the strangest, most hilarious films I have seen in a long time. This was my first Wes Anderson film, and I have to say that I will be checking out more of his movies in the future. An absurdist tale about friendship and violence. There is almost nothing wrong with this movie other than that it is too short and ends a bit too abruptly. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant in this movie, and it is truly a criminal offense that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Bradley Cooper, Micheal Keaton, and Eddie Redmayne should have never been nominated over Ralph Fiennes. The only performance that was better than Fiennes' in that year was Jake Gyllenhall's in Nightcrawler. But, Nightcrawler was definitely not as good a film as Grand Budapest. Heartfelt, Hilarious, and Heartbreaking. Easily the best film of 2014. 10 out of 10. There really isn't much to say but see it, love it, and watch it again. I know I did."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 May 2020,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) - [10/10]I've spent a long time trying to word this review... and I can't. This film is amazing. It's spectacular. Every little thing about it is perfect (aside from a few continuity errors, but I only first noticed them on my fourth viewing) much like the exquisite mise en scène. It is beautifully written, masterfully directed, and wonderfully executed. I have nothing but compliments for The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), so I'll keep this review short. With excellent production design, spectacular performances, and camera movements and shots that fill you with satisfaction, this film is a cinematic experience and masterpiece. It is rewatchable. It has small significant details that you won't notice until a second or third viewing, so it makes each viewing a new experience. Everything is perfect, just like Wes Anderson's symmetrical framing. Like the imaginary Mendel's Courtesan au Chocolat delicacies, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is a delightful treat that you will not be able to get enough of."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2019,8/10,"A lovely movie which i can watch again and again.with this and fantastic mr fox and life aquatic, wes anderson really hits the sweet spot"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 April 2014,10/10,"This was an spectacular getaway of a movie. Masterfully directed by Wes Anderson and beautifully looking, with his unique and branded style. It also had Avery engaging story that featured enough mystery and whimsical comedy to keep you entertained and amused. But more importantly, I really enjoyed the whole narrative and how it incorporated to the movie and revealed itself very gracefully. The acting was excellent as well, led by an exquisite performance from Ralph Fiennes and newcomer Tony Revolori, but also from all its main cast (F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, etc.) who was very vast and that were splendid in every bit of scene, even the most minimal ones, they were simply gems of the whole movie. This is one of those movies that not only is it visual but the whole package from beginning to end, and even during the end credits, you get to enjoy. Overall, this was a wonderful movie that surely its and addition to cult classic movies and to Wes Anderson's repertoire."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 September 2017,10/10,"The story of the Grand Budapest Hotel is told in the most beautiful, artistic and amazing way. Set in four levels based on the story of M.Gustav and Zero, told by an elderly Zeron, a young Author (Jude Law) and his elder self (Tom Wilkinson). Level 2: Author Introduction (Tom Wilkinson) - again very brief, as an old man is to tell the tale of his visit to the Grand Budapest. Level 3: Author Visits Hotel (Jude Law) and meets Zero (F.Murray Abraham) - this is many years after the main story and Zero who is now a lot older is there to tell the tale of how he came to own the hotel, by the visiting Author Level 4: Bell Boy Zero and M'Sieur Gustav (Ralph Fiennes) - the main story. Beautifully told story, it is so amazingly beautiful. M.Gustav is the most wonderful eccentric concierge. The imagery is as beautiful as you can find and you will see similarities between this and The Fantastic Mr Fox. Lastly you will find many familiar faces popping up, including Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, Léa Seydoux, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and Owen Wilson.It is one of my favourite films ever, simply it has been put together with the finest detail and a quirky fun and elegant tale. I can understand if you don't share this view, but ask you simply listen to the great word play and the fabulous scenery. There are so many great lines. Hope you enjoy it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is part of a dreamy landscape. You will meet the most interesting characters clad in the most striking outfits with personalities to match. Every shot is like a photograph, visually moving and full of depth. There are several parts of this film that appear to be shot like a play; clever titles and transition credits cause for the viewer to prepare themselves for the next act.Every single character has an interesting role and or story. From the lobby boy to the several socialites who frequent the hotel, they all tell compelling stories. The cinematography combined with the superb acting are really what made this film the great piece of art that it is. Every shot describes the scene without using words. Camera movement follows various actors making the experience so much more magical."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2014,4/10,"Wes Anderson is undoubtedly one of the finest directors we have working today, and this is very much evident throughout the span of his latest film The Grand Budapest Hotel. His choice of adjusting the screen format, his color pallets and sleek cinematography are what save this movie from being a flop. Yes, it is great directing. Yes the performances, especially Ralph Fiennes, are top notch. This is a decent movie, but decent is where it stops. It doesn't have anything to separate itself from previous quirky and dark humor filled films that Wes Anderson has released, it doesn't have the heart from Moonrise Kingdom, the charisma of The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the mystique from The Darjeeling Limited. Yes, every director may have their own styles and tweak it differently for each of their works, but Wes Anderson only adds some minor plot differences to his films to make them slightly ""different,"" yet still far too similar. I have been fine with them in the past, but by The Grand Budapest Hotel, his fourth main entry, the goofy style becomes a little tedious and actually difficult to get through in some scenes. Many trivial things are presented as important matter in drawn out sequences, making it all the more difficult to watch. Yes, I am harshly bad mouthing this movie, but I did still find some enjoyment in watching the gorgeous film making and the once in while funny script, but come the third act, all the twists just become much too predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. I hope Wes Anderson has something up his sleeve that can add variety into his collection, because my patience level for this is slowly declining. GRADE: C"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2018,,"Offbeat, delightfully funny and at times even poignant. Incredible cast. Well written. This movie isn't for everyone but for those who get it, it's a piece of art. My only regret is that I didn't see it 4 years ago."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 January 2015,8/10,"I was surprised of this funny interesting subject. That story includes many interesting facts about how we can see things nd maybe how things can or could be. The acting between actor and events is amazing and the editing is sometimes so fast but with meaning. From the technical point i have no complain at all. Also the subject is more than 90% perfect and so constructed in every detail. The script is very funny and with a lot fantasy and impressing. What it considered a bit slowly is the part after the prison when they are escaped. The main actor is telling many and many things, in fat, bullshits, unnecessary. We know that we can put such things in movie...but when the film is so beautiful and full of nice information and lovely games, why the director did put such boring small parts of lazy conversation? however, congratulations!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 February 2015,8/10,"This movie is a masterpiece. I loved the poster which looks like a cardboard model of the original hotel. This movie has got everything in it. Mystery,romance, action, comedy everything. It was a very good idea to present the flash back in a different dimension than the original piece. The past is presented as it was in the past and present as the present. That makes sense. The lobby boys working in hotels can start to hope that one day they will own the hotel that they are working for. This movie helps everyone understand the meaning of first class hospitality. Zero what an intelligent little chap. Gustav what a wonderful young man. The true love of Zero for his young wife and how he holds her so dearly even after her passing away. It also presents futility of how people fight for things that they have not worked for. Enjoyed it to the core."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 January 2015,6/10,"Wes Anderson gives it a second go at direct a similar movie as the successful Moonrise Kingdom he did a few years back, fails miserably.The central theme and set of the production is well done and commendable but that's where the praise ends. For the whole movie had no clear direction and lack real character development. What Anderson try to redo here is the artsy romanticized noire of the early 20th century. where he fails is bringing together the cool score produced for the film with timing and acting. No point in talking about the lack of story and suspense development here again.I would say go see Moonrise Kingdom if you haven't before you see this miserable production. Heck go and see Fantastic Mr.Fox."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 June 2014,2/10,"I started watching this film with high expectations after all the trailer did show some noteworthy actors but within 15 minutes it became clear that these cameos were only provided to offer a false perception of a movie.I mean why did they cast Bill Murray or Jeff Goldblum if their only screen time lasted less than 5 minutes each?The plot started off as interesting but loses its way about a third of the way through the movie then the rest is really bad cgi effects (the ski scene was notably bad in particular).And why did it need to be a flashback story? Was the appearance of Jude Law really needed to tell that story? You would think for a title including the hotels name there would be a real story behind the Hotel itself but alas no, just the previous lobby boy and his protégé who is accused of murder and has to clear his name.It seems to me that the story was thrown together after the budget was spent on the special effects and pointless high-end actors that had little to no connection with the actual film. What surprises me the most is that IMDb gave it over 8 out of 10? What were you thinking? The only reason i continued to the end was Ralph Fiennes excellent acting otherwise without his it would be just 120+ minutes of bad cgi and pretty scenery."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 April 2014,3/10,"Visually and conceptually, this film is a 10 out of 10. But where Anderson's films usually generate a great deal of empathy and affection for the characters, I felt very removed from this movie. It was funny and beautiful and clever on the surface of the screen, but I never felt involved in it.That's fine, actually. I don't mind being challenged a bit. Directors make some films for audiences and some films for themselves. I get the impression that Wes Anderson made Grand Budapest for himself. It was not really for me, as much as I love most of his films, but I appear to be in the minority."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 March 2014,8/10,"Well I had not seen a Wes Anderson film before and I was attracted to this by the trailer which is full of lovely looking shots.The film itself certainly does look beautiful and the way in which some of the scenes are shot is really very clever.The whole film has a cartoon quality about it and some of the scenes are indeed animated such as the introduction of the hotel itself.Three different screen ratios are used, one for each period in the film. I don't think this worked particularly well and personally I would have preferred just sticking with 2.35:1 throughout. I got a bit fed up with what looks like a narrow square for much of the film.It is a joyful romp, however nothing about it ever touches very deeply."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 January 2020,10/10,This movie is genuinely amazing and creative. It was a real freshener to see something truly new!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 July 2018,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a sweet adventure that will warm your heart, wes anderson knows how make a emotional scene even with a cartoony tone and cartoony characters, the acting is great especially with Ralph Fiennes, the way this movie is shot is amazing it's shot like it's in the time period and wes anderson uses the the practical effects used at the time and uses Aspect Ratio that were used at the time, my only problems is that some of the actors are underused like Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton and there was that one scene where there was an old naked woman but thats the only problems with the movie, overall the movie was amazing you will love it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2014,6/10,"I really liked Bottle Rocket and Moonrise Kingdom, and I appreciate the warmth and humor of Rushmore. I've also seen most of Wes Anderson's other feature films, but they didn't engage me anywhere near as much as those three. Grand Budapest, unfortunately, is another also-ran. It seems more like a cartoon than a story about people. It presents caricatures instead of characters and make-believe instead of history. I do enjoy stylized films and TV, but extreme artificiality only works for me if it plays off something honest and real. Grand Budapest, however, is a cold and mechanical film: a caper of sorts, with a surfeit of chase scenes and narrow escapes. It might have been a ballet danced by wind-up toys. Although we glimpse dozens of beloved stars flitting across the screen, the effect is more like celebrities voicing animated images than an ensemble cast bringing events to life. (At least it wasn't in 3D!) I'd like to see the talented Mr. Anderson return to making movies about actual breathing people. Presenting misfits struggling to find their place in the world is what he's always done best. Maybe the idea of Grand Budapest started out that way, but that's not where it ended up."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2020,8/10,"A film, if classified as a comedy, will at least taste sweet, no matter how dark it is at the core.
If contemporary American scams are the equivalent of an American milkshake, the grand Budapest hotel is definitely a raspberry pie, with a floppy pie base and a rose-colored mousse topped with a fresh layer of raspberries. It's the one you look back at when you walk past a dessert shop window."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2020,8/10,"M. Gustave also admires the fact that he can insist on being himself in any environment, and his heart will not be swayed by the environment. All the experiences he will feel are just experiences, leaving no trace of change on him"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,4/10,"When I came to the theater to watch the movie, I had no preconceived expectations about it. 20 minutes into the movie I realized that it was not a movie made for large audiences, but rather a movie created to please the sensibilities of those that view life in a peculiar way. It reminded me of ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Adaptation,"" which have their own cult following.The movie does rely on a superb cast of actors that won't disappoint any moviegoer; but the problem with the movie is the story itself. In a unique way, it rehashes old themes of greed, intolerance, and obsession with the material world. It helps perpetuate the notion that humanity is flawed and that life has no ultimate purpose. It seems to reinforce those sensibilities generated or amplified explicitly and implicitly by individualistic life choices and humanistic thoughts within the confines of the human experience.Artistically, it lacks the complete range of human emotions necessary for a wholesome movie. Nevertheless, in an uncanny way, it would certainly connect with those that already made up their minds about the meaning of life in a subtle and reaffirming manner."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2019,6/10,"The movie consists of consecutive tableaus. One cinematic comic book style dollhouse backdrop after the other. Never closing in on a reality anyone has ever seen. Dream like at times, the contradiction to this the overt nature of man that is evident as it is decadent greed and perversion.
I kept thinking this is what would happen if Tintin was made into the realm of the real tangible world."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 August 2014,10/10,"i am Robert dean. Memphis, Tenn. i have loved movies ever since i was a child. i have known through their reviews most of the film critics in America. i did not see the movie ""the grand Budapest hotel"" when it came out in the theaters. i am a 4 time cancer, 2 time brain surgery patient! i am very grateful to be alive. however, i now have another endocrine neck tumor that may kill me. this takes precedence. however, i love good comedy, and comedians (comediennes). i had seen ""the grand hotel Budapest"" listed on Redbox's menu. robin Williams' death almost finished me! i was incapacitated mentally and physically for some time. however, i started watching the movie today. a masterpiece! this may be the finest, best made, best acted, best story, best scenery, everything, i have ever seen in my entire long life! to top it off, i was thrilled, as the reels ran, to see my favorite actors! what names! they are all here! Murray Abraham. Ralph Fiennes. i don't want to spoil anything, so, i am simply going to watch it again. i do not want to know the director, and, other boring details. that would be similar to me asking Rembrandt van Rijn who were the characters in his painting ""the Nightwatch""!! this is, in my opinion, one of the finest, if not the finest, movie ever made!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 September 2015,6/10,"This film has excellent cast, costumes and decorations. However it has a very weak and unconvincing plot and fails at storytelling. It feels like wandering through and exotic clothing shop or costume ball with carefully chosen grotesque characters. You await to see a great story but you get a banal and predictable plot. So this film is some kind of baroque, decorative piece which is supposed to amuse and entertain but never goes deeper than that.I was also surprised that the picture of a boy with the apple which is the center of the plot was so poorly executed. It is supposed to be a very valuable renaissance-like painting and they hired an artist who worked some months on it. The result looks like a cheap prop for a film, which does not look convincing at all. It is weird since there exist plenty of artists who could produce an excellent classic portrait in just 1-2 weeks.I grade this film at 6/10, so it is not a total waste of time, but you can find better films to watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2015,9/10,"This is one of the best films of 2014.I just can't help but love this film because you notice the effort that was put in every single shot of this picture. I really liked it, that most of the time the camera was placed in the middle of the room and commensurate to the wall it was filming. This made the shots look symmetric and two- dimensional.The story takes place in different time periods and it's really cool that they used a different aspect ratio for every single one of them. They also bothered to mostly use old practical effects instead of CG like miniatures or pictures in the background which only supports the charm of the movie even more. Some of the characters are really over the top ridiculous but you'll notice that that's intensional and used as a part of the humor and these characters are all very enjoyable.Overall i was entertained throughout the whole movie and i suggest that you all check it out."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 February 2020,5/10,"Making laugh is not an easy art, even though you have an excellent cast, director and scenography, as you can tell after seeing this not-funny comedy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 May 2021,9/10,Creating a new aesthetic!Revolutionary art.The color that comes to life.The movement that draws the lines ...All this is pure art!A very important and fantastic film.Excellent fruition.A genre that is not easy to use with such a complex shape.A scary scenography that goes hand in hand with excellent photography.All very perfect like Wes' style!-Antonio.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 September 2018,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a brilliant film by Wes Anderson and probably his greatest. There is no other directior that has a more distinctive style than him, so only he can handle this film perfectly. It's very entertaining to watch, and not only is this a nostalgic throwback to the 1930s but also a charming and nice story that gives justice to the source material.In 1932 in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, The once famous hotel called the Grand Budapest owned by the legendarily funny and interesting Gustave. H. The person who plays Gustave H., is probably one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a movie, he's funny, rude, mysterious, and hilarious, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. And the immigrant lobbyboy Zero is also very funny and interesting. They both form a friendship as the movie progresses. Gustave's girlfriend dies tragically so, he goes pays respect, but her family is evil and rude, so he and Zero steal a very important Oil painting. And then the movie becomes an action adventure, and things get Tarantino-style violent. The reason why the characters are obsessed with the oil painting is because it's the only thing in the movie that isn't Wes Anderson style. BTW Wes really gets carried away with the symmetrical framing and warm colors, but that's what I love about his movies, his movies are original and creative. The actors who play Gustave and Zero do respective jobs, but we also get equally hilarious performances from Adrian Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Willam Defoe, Edward Norton, the list goes on.This film looks like an oil painting. Brilliant work of art.Masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2019,9/10,From the witty writing to the fantastic cast to the AMAZING cinematography and editing there is so much here to love. Oh and this is one of the funniest and saddest films I've watched at the same time. 9/10
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 August 2019,7/10,"I'm someone who absolutely loves dumb artsy fun in a movie. I love being able to look at a movie and have several times where I audibly say ""Wow."" The problem with The Grand Budapest Hotel is that every frame is one of those frames. The first five minutes are the best. Then, you just become desensitized to it looking good. It honestly kinda hurts to watch. Maybe another person would be fine with it, but I found the movie to be kinda boring and it eliminates what it aimed to be."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 January 2016,9/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but too say I was pleasantly surprised is a massive understatement....The casting was exemplarily, Ralph Fiennes was magical to watch and played the straight-tongue in cheek role of the deliciously warped Mr Gustave with aplomb and to my utter amazement.The cameo role of William Defoe as the unforgiving henchman was brilliantly underplayed as were the supporting roles of the host of big name stars popping in for short appearances.I guess the two main things that make this movie was the writing and the pace and direction, both were first class, a mixture of straight to the point humour and veiled sarcasm which left me laughing almost every minute of the 99 minutes of pure delight in this fast paced brilliant piece of comedic film-making.I realise that this film might not be to everyones taste especially if sarcasm is not your thing, but nonetheless it's still a highly enjoyable and fantastic film which I'm sure you would find very funny.This film is right up there with my all time favourites already....if there's a second helping I'd be even more happier."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2020,10/10,Come on guys - there's nothing to hate and so so much to love and appreciate it this movie.. let's get it to the 10 it deserves
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 December 2019,10/10,"Gustave H. talks about humanity, though he knows he's not the most sterling example of the species. There's a part at the end where we know he was right all along. Yeah, you can say the movie is largely about a bunch of dysfunctional, quirky morons who all have something to do with a pastel pink-painted, sometimes dilapidated hotel, but you can't deny there's something truly authentic about it all."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 June 2017,9/10,"I have only seen one wes anderson movie until i watched TGBH(it was darjeeling limited : i liked it but it was just only a good enough movie for me) but grand Budapest hotel just blew my mind of. from the very start u get addicted to the movie. this is a movie that should be seen in big screen not in your desktop, because this one provides visuals of that kind. i never even felt a single boring period or any lags. The acting by all the main characters were of top quality. The character development has been done brilliantly, casting was also spot on. Since watching this i have downloaded almost all wes anderson movies. Storywise it has a good story nothing more than that, but instead it was the screenplay, art direction, dialogues, acting which made this movie from good to great. To me one of the best 100mins spent. If you haven't seen it , see it asap because this one you cannot miss."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 July 2015,10/10,"It is almost impossible to describe why The Grand Budapest Hotel was such a success. Anderson has created a film, so ridiculous and intelligent, it is hard to pinpoint where the movie became gold. I will attempt to do so. Its surprisingly captivating premise follows Fiennes' wonderful character M. Gustave, the vein, witty and legendary hotel concierge, who steals the spotlight with an eye catching purple tux. His character meets Zero (Tony Revolori), the new purple suited lobby boy who soon becomes his most loyal of friends. In its own way, the movie cannot be classified into one genre. There is some comedy, placed in the perfect places to draw attention to what was necessary— but overall the film deals with much more intense subject matter. It deals with loss, greed and value— breaking the imaginary world the characters are placed in. Its charming yet true dialogue opens up a whole new side of every character we see on screen. We get true depth into the minds of every character, gaining different intelligent perspectives of worth and wealth in the minds of fictional yet relatable characters. The film also successfully obtains an Inception storyboard, going from different time periods and locations but centring on one clear message, that being about life of a man who was wealthy and alone— to becoming a man who was loyal, honest and brave. Dealing with the loss of his friend (a 100 year old version of Tilda Swinton), it is discovered that her most priced possession— the symbolical Boy with an Apple painting— has been given to Gustave, instead of her greedy children. The apple of temptation and knowledge places a spell on Dimitri (the brilliant Adriaan Brody), who stops at nothing to retrieve the painting back. The film will be known for its glorious sets— bursting with colour and exploding with detail— but what was as clever was the charming atmosphere that was created. It is extremely difficult to create a good movie, but what is even harder— is to make a good movie that viewers will want to re-watch over and over again. Brilliantly, Wes Anderson has done so. A. Ryan Farrell."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 January 2020,10/10,"The plot can only be described as multifaceted, yet incomparable to any other existing work.ImageThe characters can only be summarized as sublime, sensational, and stellar; with the vigorous and charismatic charm that dispenses an irrevocable and scintillating aura over the timeless portrayals.The cinematography can only be as expected from the eclectic and distinct ingenuity of Mr. Wes Anderson; though this endeavor boasts the most memorable application yet.ImageThe overall unanimity vociferates the magnificence that the many units of language are eloquently strung together-thus-forging a melodic and classic masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,9/10,"""Did he just throw my cat out of the window?""Can a film be absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful at the same time? Yes. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' combines all those elements. And I didn't even mention the most important characteristic: it is visually wonderful.In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old- world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war (The Trans-Alpine Yodel) - Anderson has given thought and attention to everything.Wes Anderson serves up what might be called a 'romp-com' with this between-the-wars tale of the misadventures of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), concierge at a splendid spa hotel which manages to be located simultaneously in the Alps and Eastern Europe. Falsely accused of the murder of one of the hotel regulars (Tilda Swinton, made to look like a cross between Edna Everage and Miss Havisham), Gustave and his apprentice escape from prison and go on the run, aided by a 'mafia' of continental concierges.If one measure of a work of art is how thoroughly it creates its own world, then this movie is completely successful. It is funny, witty, charming. There isn't a dull frame or a wasted moment. In the spirit of the Mitteleuropa that it dusts down and recreates, like the wares of its fictional baker, it is exquisitely crafted and delicious. It is nostalgic whilst casting a shrewd light on nostalgia, and only superficially superficial.Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells a dark story, and Anderson isn't afraid to give some shocking moments, hence the film's R rating. Coming off of Moonrise Kingdom, this is surprising, but it's also a refreshing change of pace from Anderson's latest outings, including Fantastic Mr. Fox.Supporting roles from Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray, and Edward Norton help round out the delightful cast of characters, yet sometimes the hotel feels a bit too crowded. This may not matter much given that Fiennes and Revolori are the stars of the show, but it can be a bit jarring considering their limited screen time. Blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances from the likes of Owen Wilson can break up the film's quick and zippy pace, and one wonders if his character is entirely necessary or if Wilson appeared for simply fan service given Anderson's legendary cast.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous work, you cannot miss this, and even if you're not a fan you should go and see it anyway. For these reasons The Grand Budapest Hotel gets a 9/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 October 2021,9/10,"The essence of the combination between the genuine frames, like the palette of colors; shots perfectly aligned, the dressing, and the soundtrack with the identity of the eastern europe, generate a unique vibe that are usual in the Anderson's films. Makes a whole experience to the eyes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2019,10/10,"Definitely Wes Anderson's masterpiece for me, reckoning the screenwriting, cinematography technique, and all. I myself have the favouritism of Chaplin, Iñárritu, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Bertolucci. But after I've finished Grand Budapest Hotel, I immediately know what the missing piece of my life is!And what an amusing film! There is a tremendous flairs, a unique one, of what I call ""life"" there; a spectrum of time that you could feel the absolutely of pleasure out of it, a conundrum and a tear shed for humanity, and a momentary of a certain sadness. From time to time, I usually have a different word to describe those feeling of life passing by, the romanticism... and a vast, indescribable longing of something far, far away...After the end roll in which I was clapping my hands along, it's good too know that The Grand Budapest Hotel gave me those beautiful feeling... and at least I'm contented by that fact."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 May 2018,6/10,"I heard of it being a classic must-watch, so i watched it. It's one of those movies that apparantly requires a certain taste for the lightheartidly absurd, if I had to describe it as anything. It borderlines arthouse material, with every single scene being centered to the last inch. If anything, this movie continues to grab your attention by putting every character, in ever moment dead-center. You have no idea if this even takes place on planet earth, or in a parallel reality. The country in which it takes place is somethting vaguely German-European and when there is a sporadic mention of a war -an element that is marketed to be a key plot point but really the movie is the same if it were without it - they even go as far as renaming SS to ZZ. I mean... what? The story doesn't have much to it - it's a man telling a story, about another man telling a story on how he was the protegé of an esteemed congierge of the dubious hotel. How said hotel has fallen into ruin in the first place is hardly mentioned, and the story that you'd expect - about the hotel itself you'd presume - becomes a weird tale on art thieves, a dead widow and a shady testament. Could be fun, and it kinda is, but the manner in which it all is told is silly to say the least. Something monty-python like posh slapstick humour almost. So yeah, weird and silly, but strangely amusing at the same time. Still wondering why the hell some characters were portrayed as being a vampire or werewolf without ANY reason for them to be those things in this premis! 
 
All in all: masterpiece? naah. The only thing masterpiece worthy here is the acting. Too bad Tilda Swinton had such a short role - I love that woman in every role she plays! Ralph Fiennes' posh but foul-mouthed caharcter is a delight, there are some teeny tiny roles for Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Tony Revolori has a very endearing character. They amused me well anough for leaving this movie a positive review but other than that it just left me confused."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 August 2021,10/10,"Just a perfectly acted and filmed movie. Color all throughout is flawless, costumes as well. Hidden gem roles all throughout played by the highest caliber actors and actresses."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 December 2014,3/10,"you will not laugh in this movie, unless you enjoy delusional British comedy and by that I mean jokes of an up-tight 60 year old and over blown conversations with stuffing needless words like "" quite absurd and tedious "" which ironically describe the film.I watched this movie because it has a lot of movie stars that I like which obviously was intended for selling the film, lets add a 2 second shot of Bill Murray answering a phone or just walking by !!William Dafoe's character was the only thing remotely enjoyable in this piece of torture and time waste. it drew a sad smile on my face during the length of praying for a laugh !I don't recommend this film unless you feel like boring yourself to death."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 December 2015,6/10,"Well, until this year I really believed and trusted the IMDb top 250, however the last three years show me that the top changes too much depending on people who look only action and empty films or advertisers. The first sh° to see from the top was Mad Max Fury road. Mamma mia how awful a movie! And now this one. Yes, this was much higher in quality but all the screenplay was so empty and without sense...The only thing for which I can recommend to watch this if you really do not have other choices, is its rather comic scenes. This is my first review so I do not know yet how much spoilers I can write so I will not write none. IMDb, please, put some age limit or something, otherwise all the old marvelous movies will soon be gone outside the top and new comedies and cartoons will replace them..."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 May 2014,1/10,"That an intense and intelligent movie this is. As others have noted, the nods to Italian cinema of the 70's era are bold and brash, yet it's also a quintessential Englishman abroad drama. The atmosphere created by the soundtrack was electric and it felt like hearing the world with new ears when I left the picture house at the end.Don't expect a neat narrative, this film plays with your senses and your understanding of whose doing what to who and why. It's exceptionally claustrophobic throughout, and the disconcerting edits constantly leave you asking more questions about what's going to take place next."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2020,10/10,This is the best movie ever created. The story is very interesting. The characters are well developed. There is a lot of comedy. The set design is beautiful. Everything about this movie is perfect. truly a masterpiece!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 August 2020,10/10,"If ever there was a film that was difficult to pigeon hole this is it. It moves from the ludicrous to the sublime in the blink of an eye and left me thoroughly entertained in the process. Mr Gustav is superb, Zero is superb, this film is superb. It truly is a masterpiece and quite unlike anything else. Wes Anderson does what he does best in creating an image so rich and vibrant its impossible not to fall in love with it. In my opinion this is his best work."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 July 2019,6/10,"Interesting tale and humour, but not as deep or thought out as I expected it would be. Didn't enjoy the ending, or the beginning. Light hearted comedy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2021,10/10,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I watched it because it was a Top 250 and I believe that it should be much higher on the list.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 May 2021,10/10,Master pice. Of movie cinema at it best. Wonderful caracters. Difrent filmd.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 May 2014,1/10,"There isn't a zero rating? or a ""minus"" rating? wasted characters, wasted dialog, disjunctive, listed as a ""comedy"" and is NOT a comedy by any stretch of imagination. quick shot of fellatio....stupid. replace the ""apple"" painting with a woman fondling another woman....dumb. Adrien Brody screaming obscenities at the reading of the will...why? Willem Dafoe on skis, being chased...what? Harvey Keitel's prison character with a bad-fitting bald-thing covering his head. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton....shame on you. Adrien Brody---WHY???? people either loved it or loathed it, it seems. I really wanted to ask for a refund. I really don't understand the positive reviews---I guess I wasn't existential enough."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 January 2019,1/10,My husband liked this and I thought it was one of the most stupid films ever which was just quite frankly weird and very very long!
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 May 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel ReviewWritten by Ryan NilsenThe Grand Budapest Hotel Directed by Wes Anderson Starring: Ralph Fienes, I would say that it's very refreshing to have as good a film as ""Budapest"" this early in the year, but ah who cares. It's May! Now that Spring has sprung so have the great films coming to theaters!Quirky and wonderful. Those are the two words I would use to describe Wes Anderson's new film The Grand Budapest Hotel. Anderson's last film Moonrise Kingdom was an absolute joyful surprise. It was one of my personal favorite films of 2012 and I made a vouch to see whatever this man puts on the big screen next. It seems that vouch payed off because by gone it he's done it again! The film takes place in the 1930's between wars in Europe and is about a European Grand Budapest Hotel's famous concierge, M. Gustave (played by a magnificent Ralph Fienes). After the woman in which he loves (or one of them at least) is murdered, the will for who will receive her money and possessions is read and she has left none other than her priceless painting ""Man with an Apple"" to Gustave. The family of the deceased battle Gustave and his new friend-Lobby Boy ""Zero"" for this prized possession as well as for an enormous fortune. This is Ralph Fienes' best performance to date. His remarkable banter in his relationship with Zero is hysterical, interesting, and at some points touching. Without a doubt the best performance of the year so far. However, the most unique part of the film as a whole is the directing. Wes Anderson's style is so incredibly plain and unusual at the same time (in a good way). It feels like a very old 1930's film with very basic angles and strait-forward shots, but at the same time it makes the film all the more entertaining to watch. It can't be explained on paper that's why you have to SEE IT! The humor in this film is very quirky and off the wall, much dirtier than that of Moonrise Kingdom. Budapest is not for everybody, but it will take you on a journey that is entertaining till the end. The Grand Budapest Hotel is indeed grand.***' stars"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 April 2014,7/10,"Wes Anderson is an artist. He doesn't see film as a purely commercial product, but as a craft, something to build, a personal vision---art. Anderson's film art can take on the feel of a picture book or an elaborate model and perhaps no film better exemplifies this approach than his new release, Grand Budapest Hotel.Writing a review of a Wes Anderson film inevitably comes down to a judgment: Are his films a quirky, obsessively arranged delights, or are they compulsive, silly and shallow forms of artifice? In many ways I'm split. Anderson is not a bread and butter filmmaker. In some ways it is unfair to judge his work by normal standards because he's not trying to make ordinary films. Anderson takes pride in high style---style so thick that it's a fog, style that in some ways becomes more the subject of his films than any character. Style for the sake of style, of perhaps more accurately, style for the delight of style. Grand Budapest Hotel is perhaps his most stylistically potent concoction. The compositions, the costumes, the sets, the dialogue, the sequencing, the music, the structure, the cameos, the flat, slightly ironic acting style, everything is stamped with the Wes Anderson seal with the volume cranked up to new levels. This, in a way, makes the film very fun. It moves fast and has delightful visuals. Odd bits of humor are peppered in, and the characters, while sketchy, are evocative. But in all the artifice of this world it is easy to forget that in Anderson's earlier worlds there was somewhat less artifice and a bit more heart. Bottle Rocket was an empathetic study of loserdom, and encouraged viewers to ponder what the term loser might actually mean. Rushmore was a funny but tender and detailed character study about a deeply imperfect playwriting prodigy (who, it turns out, is a quirky and smart, but otherwise normal adolescent). In this new film it is easy to miss any depth for the cloud of fun style. Something interesting is happening to this film---it is making quite a bit of money. Perhaps this reflects something about our era. While Wes has always done well with grey hairs looking for something light and grown-up and hipsters who worship his artfulness, it seems the artistic void in current film is starting to boost Anderson's art, financially. For movie goers sick of unconsidered visuals, plastered with CGI special effects that all start to look the same, Wes' craftsmanship is a good elixir. The care, the sense of fun, the charm, the very personal touch of Anderson's work feels particularly needed at this time in film history. And people seem to be responding. Although in some ways Anderson is the height of trendiness, in many ways he's old fashioned. He loves models. He refuses to worship technology. His idea of a hero is not super.The center of this film is Ralph Fiennes' Gustave H., a concierge extraordinaire, and mentor of the young Lobby Boy, Zero(Tony Revolori). His character stands out, not only for his showy quirks, but because Fiennes plays him without the dead-pan irony, so typical of performances in Anderson films, which surround him. While this film provides the expected fun, storybook escapism, with a Roald Dahl flair, there is perhaps something deeper here---Gustave H. is a man who clings to an era in the past. He's not a young man, but he's not clinging to his youth, he fancies an era and way of doing things and a way of carrying one's self that is more late Victorian than modern (this film takes place between the world wars). He lives by a different, older code of conduct, and this choice makes him excel and stand out in his surroundings. In the world of the Grand Budapest Hotel, progress isn't such a great thing. We see her in 1968, as the film opens, far past her prime, ugly, run down and a bit Soviet-looking. The film could be seen as a cautionary tale of the idolatry of progress. In our current age we obsess and cling to our progress---most of it technological things like tablet computers, cell phones, and genetic engineering, but some social, such as political correctness. This isn't the futurism of postwar America---in current form we brag of our progress with a different tone, and long gone is the optimism of that era. Whereas people of postwar America believed in the future and the positive impact of progress, we now look at the future with jaded skepticism as we brag and exaggerate our contributions to human progress. In this era, there seems to be an underground world of Gustave H's---people who carry themselves as though they are in an older more refined era, whether they can personally recall that era or not. It is a stance of personal preference but also of principal. In his own way Wes Anderson is one of these people--- people who dream of a more principled past age in reaction to our own lack of principal. If such a more principled era ever truly existed, or if every era was plagued by horrific shortcomings is beyond the point--- such yearnings are the result of humility and belief that the future can be as wonderful as an imagined past. 7 and 1/2 stars."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 May 2015,9/10,"Time and a tattered economy reduces a hotel's luxury and service to an outdated tacky building on the brink of abandonment, but with a lot of stories to tell. One of these stories is an epic tale of fortune, greed, and friendship at the pinnacle of the hotel's life. The story follows the main character, Gustave an over zealous concierge who thrives at pleasing guests in any way possible. The plot finds one of the hotel's guest dead and her family's fight for her will ensues. It is no wonder that the hotel is at the center of the dilemma because it houses all the secrets and deceptions of the movie. It is almost as if the hotel is telling the story. In fact, the movie personifies the hotel through the richness and exuberance of all its workers and guests.Throughout the whole movie, the workers were historical emblems of the past just like the hotel. The hotel, the grand Budapest, was a first class institution that represented luxury, order, and hospitality. Similarly, the workers upheld the order and the cleanliness of what the hotel stood for. Gustave preached weekly sermons to instill the ideology of the hotel. However, times were changing pre world war 2 and the hotel slowly changed as well. The current state of the hotel was nearly abandoned, profitless, outdated building, yet the movie's personification of the hotel shows how old buildings could be filled with rich history."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,10/10,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTELMssr. Gustave H. (Ralph Fieness)is the concierge of the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1932. It is a grand edifice indeed, an ancient artifact of 19th century Imperial Europe, as are most of the clientele including a number of dowagers of various title and status. They go there to reminisce about the good old days of dukes, earls, counts and princes, but mostly they go there because of the ""exceptional service"" provided to them by M. Gustave H. Those of you that have a dirty mind will find it an appropriate tool in this particular case. One of these ladies, Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) is so taken by M. Gustave H's ""service"" that a valuable painting is to go to him when she dies, which shortly and conveniently she does. This beneficent bequest causes much consternation to her family heirs. Principle among them is her son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and his hired thug J.G. (Willem Dafoe). These two should find a comfortable home in the oncoming fascist takeover of Europe as together they elaborately plot to frame M. Gustave H for murder .And let the adventure begin!Together with his apprentice and protégé Zero (wonderfully done by Tony Revlori) they will encounter art theft, gunplay, cold blooded murder, jail breaks, Nazis, a ski chase like we haven't seen since James Bond, a network of conciergery (if there is such a word, I wouldn't try it in Words with Friends) with apparent super powers well beyond the Fantastic Four; and German pastry to die for.Sound absurd? It is. It is at times cartoonish maybe even silly with slapstick and sight gags to accentuate the absurdist dialogue and action. It is an existential comedy that would either make Sartre turn over in his grave or stand up and cheer. I would hope it would be the latter, although I have never detected much of a sense of humor in Sartre.To continue further with this absurdist binge, this movie, with its distinct European sensibilities, was written and directed by that good ole' boy Texan Wes Anderson. (Academy Award Nomination, screenplay) Do you recall William Hurt's character in ""The Big Chill"" stating glumly and pessimistically the existential lament that ""Let's face it, we're all alone out there, and tomorrow we got to do it all over again""? Anderson and Fiennes create in M. Gustave H a character who might say that very same line, only with M.Gutave H, it would be said with enthusiasm and gusto. They have given us a hero with an almost ancient likeness (think Achilles) resourceful, intelligent and courageous; supremely self- confident in his ability to overcome any situation no matter how challenging, dangerous or dire and of course do it with style. It is refreshing that the director and actor bucked the current trend to portray the hero as sociopath. Don't get me wrong I loved Walter White. It is hard to recommend this movie because I'm sure there are some people who won't like it. There is a silliness threshold that has to be overcome, and some of the European custom and mores may be a little hard to take. But if you have problems like that, write your own review, this is mine, and the movie invites you to be whisked along on the ride of M. Gustave H's great adventure. I did and had a great time. I think it one of the best movies of the year, and the Academy apparently agrees nominating it for best picture. I was disappointed that Fiennes was not nominated because for me it was the best performance of the year. By the way, it turns out Sartre was cremated, so I don't know what to do with that metaphor.PS This film has brief but meaningful appearances by Owen Wilson, Bill Murray (always in an Anderson film) Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Kietel, Ed Norton, F. Murray Abraham and other familiar faces, if you like that sort of thing. Well even if you don't like it, they're in it.Please click on my name above to read my other reviews, or check out my blog blognmovies/tumblr"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 December 2014,9/10,"Some people seem to wonder why The Grand Budapest Hotel has garnered so much attention, praise and box-office success compared to other, arguably better Wes Anderson films. I, for one, have to say that I found The Royal Tenenbaums or Moonrise Kingdom better, more complex films. But I do understand the appeal and on reviewing this film will try in my very humble opinion, to dispel the mystery.Having watched 99% of Wes Anderson's filmography I would say this is by far his more accessible movie, both in the story and narration of it. It's a simple, pretty linear story, easy to follow, charming from the beginning. What I found makes this film different and easier on the viewer is that much more streamlinedThe Royal Tenenbaums had a lot of intersecting stories, as did Moonrise Kingdom and here every characters seems to serve the purpose of telling ONE story: how the aging Mr. Mustapha came to own the Gran Budapest Hotel.As always in Mr. Anderson's films, the concepts of family, friendship and loyalty are explored with nuance and subtlety as young Mustapha befriends the hotel concierge, Mr. Gustave H (played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) in a relationship that will change both of their fates. Young Mustapha, a lobby boy at the hotel, is being tutored by Mr. Gustave, and finds himself in the unique position of having to help his mentor when he's accused of murder. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse situation as Gustave is being chased by the police and assassins while he tries to clear his name. Although it sounds dramatic, the film is mostly a comedy that revolves around the two main characters and how their relationship evolves into a friendship that will last a lifetimeas they try to stay alive.For those familiar with Wes Anderson, you'll find some of his trademarks here: colorful supporting characters who make brief appearances with long-lasting impressions; tremendous attention to the detail of each frame, beautiful symmetry in the shots and a visual style that is all his own. One particular element that enhanced the film this time is that it was filmed in Europe so the shots of pre-war European towns totally add to the general feeling of nostalgia depicted throughout the movie (it's set in the early 1930s).I read somewhere that this resembles more a European film in that explores a social world that does not and did not exist in the US, and I have to agree. The myriad of British actors present add to that feel: Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and of course Ralph Fiennes.I honestly think that being much more accessible to wider audiences than his previous films, friendlier if you will, this is a movie that will appeal not only to Wes Anderson fans. It's just a beautiful cinematic experience, both narratively and visually. It actually reminded me a lot of Ernst Lubitsch's ""Ninotchka"", in the humor, wit and nostalgia. Add to that the bonus of seeing F. Murray Abraham in a prominent role again and you're set."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 January 2015,10/10,"This movie, this particular movie is something I'll never forget. Sure, the plot was not earth-shaking, no giant robots punching each other in their mechanical faces, no grand romances with sexy blondies in skintight leather suits but like hell it needs these!I'm not at all a movie junkie, and I've walked into this one blindly, not expecting much (Wes Anderson? Sure, like I care). And I wasn't mistaken, it wasn't much. But what it was, simply brilliant. Camera movement, music (oh the music...), the colours, the simple yet entertaining plot, characters... A joke it was, dramatic parts spiced with comedy, even though it was somewhat dark, I couldn't wipe the smug smile off my face.People interested in great romances, tragic betrayals, ""depth"", ""insight"" and such are lost, there is nothing for them here. Reading the reviews I'm disappointed how shallow people are, unable to enjoy such a mild yet utterly entertaining movie.""I didn't laugh once"" is something I've read way too many times. Some people were just born without sense of humour I assume."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 February 2015,6/10,"""I can't wait to see this movie i mean over 5 Oscar awards it's gotta be good "" I thought to myself.Peopole saying this movie does not need a plot is just slap in the face sad. There was nothing special about the movie. I felt like all the character were same. The shots got annoying after a while. The acting. It isn't bad but it could be better. Especially the lobby boy, no really good facial expression from him. But enough about him, let's tear the rest of the film apart. The acting was a moon distance to witty and... yeahThe script. It was full of one liners bull***, don't get me wrong i like a good one liner just as much as the next guy, but to many in a row and you get sick of'em. Obviusly there was no ""real"" plot tho there were a lot of sub-plotsThe set/locations. I'm going to admit it was really beautiful, and the hotel it self locked amazing. And the uniforms WOWWW they locked really good one of the best part of the film.It's a movie to watch, only to say that you have watch'd said movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 May 2020,1/10,"Yes, Grand Budapest says Wes Anderson all over it... I've been watching Wes Anderson films from the start and with each film, he loses the human aspect along the way, one after the other. It's almost like his ALL STAR cast becomes suppressed and in anticipating their performances you'd hope to see, but instead falls flat. They just become ordinary people to be honest.Yes, Wes Anderson is praised for having hyper attention to detail in his scenes (which is appreciated), but do you watch a movie to see how organized a bookshelf is in the background? Wes Anderson feeds into these praises for his great attention to detail and sticks to it and then keeps refining it to where his films have fallen off for me. I think he forgot about the rest of us who liked him for being ""unique enough"". Since Moonrise Kingdom, he's gone too far off that I could not appreciate a decent story because it focused too hard on small details that was unnecessary to pay attention to. I'm sorry, but someone has to say it, after watching the trailer for The French Dispatch... I already know what street Wes Anderson took. Yes I want to watch it, but it's only because i'm looking for that next Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore. However, I'm afraid he's too far past those stages now.I'll say this, one time I found myself among Wes Anderson fans at a Halloween party and we all went around claiming our favorite film of his and our least favorite... Honestly, we all had different answers because each film struck different heartstrings, which made each of his films equally appreciated. Now, that's the big question, which Wes Anderson film is the best and which is the worst? I saw The Grand Budapest in theaters with another fan of Wes Anderson and we both struggled following each detail of the movie because overall, it was not necessary to pay attention to all the small details and the overly did narrations. It's really cool to have a visually aesthetic backgrounds or scenes, but to say ""hey, look how cool the set is, focus here."" It shouldn't steal the attention away from the storyline. It's not a psychological thriller where we need to know if some detail in that scene will affect the story down the line.To put everything simply, at first I felt like Wes Anderson catered towards extroverts and the introverted characteristics followed slightly behind. Now, I can say his films are more introverted, they make you look, think and analyze each scene, but oh and look Bruce Willis... oh well... its cool he's in this movie... Wes Anderson needs to come back to a balance I think. Some of these Directors have a climax and peak in their career, I'd say maybe some of Wes Anderson's older fans would agree that he's past his peak. Like M. Night. Shyamalan, who focused too hard on making an epic twist in his films, he fell off over time ( but took the time off and is due for a comeback, hopefully).Wes Anderson will get the praise for his symmetrical scenes, quirky humor and very cordial character roles. Of course, Wes Anderson fans will say after each film, ""yep thats Wes Anderson."" However, I refuse to be blind and say that's okay or say what else would you expect from him. There's a niche market, but Wes Anderson has gone Hyper-niche. I could introduce one of his earlier films to any of my friends or family and they could get into it and would likely enjoy it. Although, I feel like with his later films, I have more difficulty to pulling in someone brand new rather than someone who's already exposed to his style. That's the huge difference with old vs. new Wes Anderson and so I'll rest my case there."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 May 2018,8/10,"Once again Wes Anderson shows why he is one of the very rare selected few auteurs whose vision can easily be recognized. Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic fim- quirky as any other Anderson outing, and ably acted by everyone from usual Anderson stock to new faces like Jeff Goldblum Jude Law and Willem Defoe. (A must watch art film)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 June 2021,10/10,"I watched this film for the first time almost two years ago and it reshaped my understanding of cinema. I no longer viewed films as solely entertainment, but also as something with the capacity to be art.Firstly, and most obviously, the visuals are phenomenal - incomparable to any other film. The genius use of aspect ratio to indirectly tell the viewer the current time period. The carefully selected colour palettes of pastel pinks, warm oranges, cold greys. The versatile combination of live action, and miniatures, and stop-motion. The lavish set design of the Grand Budapest. The liminal feel of the desolate streets. The exaggeratedly formal attire worn by the hotel staff and its patrons. It all comes together to form a truly transcendent experience.Then, there's the camerawork. This film losing the best cinematography Oscar to Birdman was the second worst crime that year - the first being Jake Gyllenhaal's snub. Here, the camera is used not only to show the audience what they need to see, but also as a tool for storytelling, a tool for misdirection, a tool for comedy. The raw beauty of what is seen on screen will linger in your mind for days.The cast is, of course, filled with familiar faces, and yet, that only serves to make the film even more impressive and enjoyable. The actors disappear in their roles, partly due to the astonishing makeovers given, but mainly due to all of their impeccable acting. Ralph Fiennes plays the part of his flamboyant, charismatic, and ever so slightly arrogant character with ease. Even high profile actors such as Jeff Goldblum or Mathieu Amalric become unrecognisable in their minor parts of Kovacs and Serge X.But it's not style and no substance - the writing here, both comedically and dramatically is some of the greatest I've ever seen. The characters are fresh and memorable, M. Gustave being a fantastically original protagonist, Zero being a brilliant medium between film and viewer. Every single character is written with a purpose and a reason, and every single character is original and amusing. The interactions between characters are fast-paced, witty, and fit within their scenes perfectly. The jokes come a mile a minute, not only in speech, but in visuals, too - and they actually land, which is a rare feat for comedy films. Anderson finds humour in the mundane and bleak - a murdered cat, a knife battle, a love for specific perfume.However, this film pulls off a near impossible feat - both humour and a strong story. It sees Zero, a lobby boy in training, and his idol, hotel concierge M. Gustave, become wrapped up in a murder plot. Where the film separates itself storywise is in the fine details. Several subplots are running at the same time in the background - an envious son out for Gustave's head, the authorities trying to solve the murder case, a blossoming love between Zero and a pastry chef. These all seamlessly flow into one another, creating a vast, expansive story, without becoming overbearing or confusing. These small things give the film an impressive rewatch value, where you'll pick up on details or foreshadowing that you didn't catch first time round.This film is not only a breeze from start to finish, but also unforgettable, beautiful art, crafted by a team of experts.Please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.-- Admin --

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 June 2014,1/10,"To be honest I still fail to understand what the fuss is all about, the film has 0% funny scenes, there is nothing funny about the chars dialogs, it is listed as ""comedy"" and yet there is 0 comedy in this supposed ""master piece"", I will admit the storyline is entertaining but up to a certain point and to me that's about the first 30m of the film, I could honestly not watch it for any longer than that, it got boring after that.Why do people keep giving this film such ratings? so far we've indicated the film has 0 comedy, a boring plot and well I ask myself, what is the point of this crap?, I have seen many movies and few times do I find crap like this but its usually voted poorly and yet this is the first boring film with such rating, I fail to understand SO MEH."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 May 2014,1/10,"Welcome to my review.Awful. Just awful. With colors and such. Let me begin with the director. What a loser. He wants to be like M. Night Shyamalan, who is probably one of the best directors now days. The style of this director guy was insane, he should be put in a mental institution. The colors on screen didn't even match. Like, a kid at the age of three even knows better. What a loser. And the cinematography was level sheit. Stupid shots and all which had nothing to do with the story at all!And then we have this guy who considers himself to be an actor. Ralh Fjennes. What a douche. I didn't believe a word he said. At one point a pictured him talking with diarrhea coming out of his mouth. That was so much fun. Because I literally saw sheit coming out of his mouth. And that stupid mustache guy. He is in every movie of this amateur. He needs to make a career change. I picture him milking cows on a Sunday morning. The story was very thin. It's about a guy who works in a hotel. Yeah, so what? I have worked in a Hotel and they're not making a movie about me?! So this movie is beyond my understanding of life. I hated this movie so much that I burned my cinema ticket. And I filmed it. Maybe I should make a movie about that, with stupid colors too!! I'm not finished. Because the soundtrack was terrible. Even my grandmother can produce better music with her immobility and lack of speech. So I watched the movie without sound the last 90 minutes. Terrible. NEVER watch this movie!This was my review, I hope you liked it"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 July 2014,1/10,"The trailer in the extra features section really sets the tone, letting you know you are in for an extraordinarily pretentious and self-indulgent mess. Most people will hate this, but even if you are drawn to the descriptors avant-garde and quirky you may still be disappointed. The Grand Budapest Hotel embarks on what is supposed to be a surreal, violent, grotesque, mythopoeic, symbol-laden, allegorical journey to spiritual enlightenment. Even taken as a series of allegorical parables, the experiment is a failure. The imagery is rarely interesting, and the symbolism manages to be at once heavy-handed and empty of real meaning. Ideas are essentially thrown at the proverbial wall in the hope that some will stick, like a novice writer who overuses Bartletts and Rogets in an attempt to show off.Wes appears to lack original ideas and so makes superficial use of symbols he doesn't truly understand in a series of cinematic Malapropisms. The film is poorly acted, amateurish, incoherent dreck which tries to convince the viewer that it is something more. Various reviewers have described it as masturbatory, which is accurate.The truly great surrealist artists reject conventions as a choice, but are capable of folowing them: Breton could render a realistic portrait of quality. Many who style themselves as surrealists are people who produce chaotic and shoddy works because they aren't capable of anything else. Don't feel like you have to like this to impress your friends. Its crap. And if you must watch one surrealist western centered on religious themes to make your checklist complete, queue up Greaser's Palace or El Topo instead. They are superior on many levels."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 June 2017,9/10,"To use the word ""quirky"" to describe a Wes Anderson film is like using the word ""wet"" to describe water, ""hot"" to describe fire, or ""horrible"" to describe Adam Sandler's film Jack and Jill. That being said, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes that very recognizable element of Wes Anderson's well-established style and embodies it in the most thoroughly enjoyable way yet. I would go as far as to say that this is his masterpiece. It has a fast-paced, humorous, and stylish cleverness to it that pervades nearly every setting, character, costume, and piece of dialogue contained within it.The entire aesthetic of the film, particularly the hotel itself, is so vivid and energetic so as to border on surreal, while being so uniquely stylized as to be completely distinct from anything else you've ever seen. The music for the film is also a tonally perfect match, being equal parts mysterious and playful. All of this brilliantly complements the revered, nearly mythical status of the strangely compelling lead character, eccentric hotel concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), who carries the film on his shoulders with great enthusiasm with his loyal lobby boy at his side.The film's universe and characters also have a distinctly ""out of place, out of time"" feeling to them. They feel just realistic enough to not be complete fantasy, but so fantastical so as to not feel real. The actual mechanics of the plot are compelling in their silly simplicity, revolving around a valuable painting known as ""Boy with Apple,"" yet the adventure that surrounds escalates into fantastically amusing absurdity. Even the villains are filled out in such a way so as to function as effective, intimidating villains yet still be surprisingly funny and almost cartoonishly nefarious. There is also a looming, somewhat nonspecific war on the brink of breaking out in this fantasy world (reminiscent of World War II era Europe), that threatens to tear it apart. Additionally, the way the story is set up is such that we know in the beginning that the glory days of this great hotel and its legendary concierge will, with time, come to an end. These elements add hints of melancholy and longing for a bygone era, which gives the film a bit more punch and substance than it might otherwise have.At its core, it's funny, fast-paced, witty, and weird, yet surprisingly simple and enjoyable. It will almost certainly win you over if you're interested in seeing something that isn't too heavy or serious, but still satisfying and full of substance. My only really complaint is that occasionally the Wes Anderson signature ""quirky"" style shines through so strongly in some of the more comedic scenes as to be cringe-inducing, but this is merely a matter of personal comedic taste. That being said, I think this movie maintains a wide appeal, even amongst individuals that haven't been a fan of Wes Anderson in the past. After all, this is probably his most universally liked film, having a unique and imaginative aesthetic and a fantastic leading performance."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 September 2018,10/10,"This is my third favorite movie ever. It looks amazing, great screenplay, great acting, and with the best score ever. It also has my favorite movie character: Gustave H. This movie takes all the great things from other Wes Anderson movies and takes all the worst things out. It's kind of disappointing Ralph Fiennes wasn't nominated for an oscar."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 December 2020,1/10,This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. The $1 DVD from the op shop was a waste of money & it went in the bin after wasting my time trying to watch it.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 August 2021,1/10,"I would like to know who Wes Anderson knows to keep having his films made and also his connections making the critics praise his films. Most of his movies are trash (Bottle Rocket and Rushmore are decent, mostly due to their actors). Grand Budapest Hotel is by far the worst, tied with Moonrise Kingdom. It's all a lie. People convince themselves his movies are good because they're phony, pretentious dweebs who pretend to like it so as to make themselves feel better by liking a ""quality "" that people not as intelligent can't understand. Stop pretending he's a genius!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 October 2021,9/10,"Wes Anderson, together with his amazing creativity, create a new, unique and beautiful style of cinematography and story telling that makes this movie an actual really great and entertaining thing to watch. I also can't finish this review without mentioning the incredible performances of Ralph Fiennes! I Highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested on a interesting story!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2020,2/10,Dont know why this movie is so overrated. It's not even a classic that some people are proclaiming into be.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2014,5/10,"I don't see what all the hype is about. I went into this film with no expectations: --Didn't have a clue what it was about. --Hadn't seen any trailers. --Heard it was a fast paced satirical comedy.Really I felt this movie was pointless. Half way through the film I kept wishing I had gone to see something else. I chuckled a few times, but overall I was bored. It didn't draw me in. I wasn't emotionally involved in the story.Perhaps the fanfare with all the celebrity appearances is what had a particularly nice appeal to others, but I am not impressed with celebrity faces.This is the first time that a film that scored a high IMDb rating has disappointed me. I am puzzled at the disparity.I cannot recommend this film. I thought it was a waste of my time and money."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 September 2014,2/10,"I am probably in a minority when I say that I didn't enjoy this movie, I wanted to like it, the idea seemed sound and the cast is a cavalcade of top notch actors.I am still trying to work out what it was that made me dislike the film, maybe it was the simple fact that there was no plot to speak of, a tenuous vehicle to give the actors a chance to show their stuff. Admittedly the sets were grand (as the name implies), the production company went all out to create this world; and the acting was excellent but there is a problem here too.The problem I found with the acting was that each member the ensemble cast didn't get a fair crack of the whip when it came to showing their stuff. Most of the actors/characters got just a few minutes of time (apart from the leads of course), I wanted more interplay between these actors, surely there was time for that rather than long rambling scenes of inane dialogue.When the film ended I was left with a feeling of ""so what"", I didn't care about the outcome of any of the characters. I am sure that some people will enjoy this but I didn't."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2014,10/10,"I don't know what it is about Wes Anderson movies, but looking back at my Moonrise Kingdom review from June 2012, it seems I felt the same way I do now about The Grand Budapest Hotel: I loved the movie, so much so that I wanted to get something up on this blog, no matter how short, but I simply didn't feel like writing much. Really, I just want to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel again and soak up any morsels of the delightful confection I might have missed the first time.But before that, a few words about exactly why I loved it so much, in the hopes that your appetite may be whetted enough to get you to the theatres, ready to sink your teeth into this delectable treat.The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson in all his glory. The sets are masterpieces, oddball works of ornate, pastel art. The cinematography is extraordinary, ditto the score (with musical mastermind Alexandre Desplat returning to Budapest from the Kingdom to work his magic once again). And the story, chock full of absurd characters and absurdist scenarios, manages to touch on human and historical truths, all in a thoroughly engaging, giggle-inducing manner.Most of The Grand Budapest Hotel takes place in 1930s Europe, although it moves around in place and time, being a story within a story, several times over. A young girl reads a book of the entire account, which was written by a now-deceased author, whom we meet as an older man (Tom Wilkinson) and then as a middle-aged man (Jude Law). As Law, the young writer travels to the Grand Budapest Hotel, only to encounter the hotel's fascinating, if lonely, owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who recounts the story of how he acquired it.With that, the main story begins. It follows Mr. Moustafa in his youth, when he was a lobby boy who went by the name of Zero (Tony Revolori) and studied under the hotel's expert concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). M. Gustave is a spectacularly thorough concierge, even going so far as to take his patrons to bed—particularly the wealthy, elderly, female blonds. When one of those patrons is murdered (the mysteriously named Madame D., played by Tilda Swinton) and M. Gustave inherits her most prized possession, her greedy family is understandably suspicious. From there, Gustave and Zero embark on a wacky caper that makes its way across fascist-era Europe, into jail and down the snowy Alps near the fictional Republic of Zubrowska, where the Grand Budapest stands tall.The Grand Budapest Hotel is as fanciful as Moonrise Kingdom, but even quirkier and much heavier. For all its whimsy and brightly coloured décor, the film's historical backdrop sets some darkly hued undertones. Case in point: the ZZ officers who invade Gustave and Zero's train compartment.But Gustave refuses to bow down to the rising wave of fascism. He insists on preserving the ""faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."" Indeed, the Grand Budapest itself is a nostalgic nod to Old Europe's refinement and romanticism. (Driving the point home, the film's 1930s storyline is shot in the nearly square aspect ratio used in the golden oldie movies of yesteryear.) Gustave runs the hotel with panache, leaving a haze of cologne and exquisite Mendl's pastries in his wake. Shamelessly flirtatious and unfailingly polite (minus an f-bomb here or there), he manages to come across as that oh-so-rare creature: an honourable jackass. This spectacular combination is delivered courtesy of Fiennes' brilliant performance. As Gustave, he's staggeringly hilarious; his brand of straight-up comedy is perfectly on point and appears utterly effortless.Fiennes steals the show, but he's backed by a seemingly endless supply of impeccable actors, none above even the smallest cameo in a Wes Anderson film. In addition to those already mentioned, The Grand Budapest Hotel features an overwhelming ensemble cast that includes many Anderson favourites, not to mention mine—Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, and Saoirse Ronan as Zero's true love Agatha, the creator of those adorable little Mendl's pastries that look as scrumptious to eat as the movie is to watch.All this to say I absolutely adored The Grand Budapest Hotel; I even managed to write a full review of it, after all. But there is some small print to read: As soon as the credits rolled, a guy behind me in the theatre said, ""That was the strangest, most boring movie I've ever seen."" Strange? Yes. Boring? Not in the least, not in my opinion. Still, maybe this movie isn't for everyone. But if you're a Wes Anderson fan, or even more generally an art fan, you should absolutely get thee to The Grand Budapest Hotel, post-haste. And you might want to bring along some pastries for the ride."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2014,10/10,"Coupled with the subtle pastel corridors and inflammatory red hotel doors, the sprawling Grand Budapest Hotel is home to many exquisite and unconventional characters, as director Wes Anderson further contorts eccentric stereotypes with his brilliant and farcical narrative. The Grand Budapest Hotel is certainly true to its grandeur title, boasting the broad and sensational world of Gustave H. (Ralf Fiennes, Schindler's List), the fabled concierge of the ages and the celebrity of the Grand Budapest Hotel itself. When an unexperienced refugee lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revelori), seeks an adept mentor, he is instead dragged into the confounding and bizarre world full of brass-knuckled psychopaths, diabolical schemers, and an immense conspiracy spanning a soon to be war-torn Europe. Wes Anderson doesn't disappoint, as his comedic adventure is astoundingly resplendent and magnificent in its execution and farcical manner.The enthralling dichotomy between Gustave and Zero is not only aided by Anderson's colourful visuals, but is tied together in a neat knot as their superficial differences become an apparent similarity. Gustave, the man in the know, deeply engrossed in his library of romantic poetry and his ability to tame insecure and rich elderly women at the drop of a dime, is presented as the perfect mentor for his soon-to-be protégé, a naive and compulsive child. His wit and conceited bravado defines his charming character, but as one should suspect, this is a mere mask, an opaque reflection of his ostensible character. Instead, he is a perfect likeness of Zero; naive and lost in the unknown, especially when he realizes the unfortunate truth: his glamorous exterior cannot stop a proverbial bullet.Zero, a refugee, hiding from the war that stole his family, is finally given the chance to roam the plains and mountainous ranges of Europe with his eccentric mentor. Falling in love, enveloping his mentors charming ways, and even developing his own persona, Zero is shown the life he would likely never have, a life he is never to leave behind. Unlike his beloved mentor, however, Zero doesn't pursue Gastave's gold-digging ways, but instead pursues a life of isolation. An old man, stubbornly attached to the memories of the once grand hotel, is withered and alone, but inadvertently immortalised his memoirs through a the curiosity of a young writer (Jude Law, Closer).In true farcical manner, The Grand Budapest Hotel encapsulates the very raw essence of fun; sporting a cast of extremely cartoonish protagonists and villains in an abundance of comic situations, Anderson's adventurous endeavour latched a smile to my face like a parasite – it didn't fall off until a quarter-hour after the film ended. A brass-knuckled Jopling (Willem DaFoe, Spiderman), always accompanied by a menacing organ tone; a deadpan lawyer, Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum, Jurassic Park); a stern police commissioner, Henckles (Edward Norton, Fight Club); The Grand Budapest Hotel has countless colourful and eclectic personalities step through its radiant doors.Whether the loudest and most unsubtle recreation of The Great Escape, or an exhilarating ski/sled chase, Anderson captures the quintessence of humour and entertainment in its many shapes and sizes; the menacing psychopath throwing a cat out of a window, or severing four fingers in an extremely tragic door-slam, The Grand Budapest Hotel condenses the basics of dark humour. Meanwhile, it contains compelling and light humour, from the delightful back-and-forth between the eclectic cast, to its eccentric visual farce. Full to the brim with laughs and giggles, it isn't a film that laughs at the audience, but instead laughs with them and embraces its comical and meta air.From an impossibly coincidental Chekhov's gun that saves the day in true deus-ex machina style, to the ridiculous escapades our radiant cast gorges itself upon, The Grand Budapest Hotel does nothing to avoid its inherently light-hearted disposition. Instead, it embraces it, as Anderon's popular 'fiction inside a fiction' style (See: The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, for example) is embraced in its entirety – even the aspect ratio of the picture changes as the narrative jumps from past to present. Visual elements that I would once deem tacky are now welcomed in my mind, as Anderson proves his squared and symmetrical style tantalizing and hypnotic. Vibrant and colourful, the bountiful hallways and stairwells of the Grand Budapest are a pleasure to the eye.I feel bad having written this far without giving some of the lesser performances the attention they deserve – in the few lines she delivers, Agatha (Saoirse Ronan, The Lovely Bones), Zero's talented dessert designer and soul mate overshadows many of the smaller performances. I daresay that Bill Murray paled in comparison, although his role was extremely limited. Wes Anderson proves that even with an immense cast of well-known actors, he is able to extract their essence of entertainment in mere seconds or minutes, as minor roles are diverse and extraordinary. Gustave, however, with his nuances and idiosyncracies, steals every moment on scene, and Fiennes once again proves his acting mettle.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an overwhelming triumph, a pleasure to the eye, the ear, and the mind. Absorbing the true meaning of entertainment in its self-parodying and meta fashion, it manages to radiate enjoyment and energy around every corner of the sprawling hotel, and the immense land-mass of Europe. While I despise the use of sensationalistic hyperbole, it is, without a doubt, among the most enjoyable films I have ever perused. I suggest this to all, young and old, as The Grand Budapest Hotel has depth, humour, farce, and fun in an amalgamation of film-making talent. Violent and crude, innocent and naive, hilarious and touching, this is a film that cannot be missed, even if its bizarre but effective style may appear intimidating to the average watcher."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 July 2014,10/10,"Two years ago I saw Moonrise Kingdom and was left feeling somewhat empty. After seeing The Grand Budapest Hotel I can most definitely say Wes Anderson has gotten his mojo back.People bash Anderson for using style over substance but I think he blends the two wonderfully in this movie. We see M. Gustave develop (sort of) as he struggles through hardships he isn't familiar with.There is also a reoccurrence of dark humor and sudden jolts of excitement throughout. But I shan't spoil anything.Overall I highly recommend it, I saw it with my family and they all loved it as well."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 March 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel isn't just for Wes Anderson fans. As a big fan, I feel that sometimes it can be difficult to jump into Anderson's films without premeditation. Yet Anderson's eighth film could very well be his most accessible to date. He has once again created a whimsical world in his latest, and the film is loaded with visual gags and employs Anderson's signature flair to great effect. With his latest, Anderson doesn't enhance his style, he simply masters it, creating another charming film to add to his wall, one that both fans and non-fans can eat up.In The Grand Budapest Hotel, we are introduced to the legendary Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), a hotel concierge at the famous Grand Budapest Hotel. The film tells the story of his adventures with his lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori). After the death of one of his guests and lovers, Madame D (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is suspected of murder after he is left a mysterious painting in her will.From this point, the film springs into action, giving us the crazy set pieces and wild scenarios that only Anderson can create. This wouldn't be possible without Fiennes, who gives one of the best performances of his career as the suave yet crass Gustave H. He is one of Anderson's most memorable characters to date, and along with Zero, the two make quite a pair. Saoirse Ronan also shines as Agatha, a bakery girl who also serves as Zero's love interest.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells a dark story, and Anderson isn't afraid to give some shocking moments, hence the film's R rating. Coming off of Moonrise Kingdom, this is surprising, but it's also a refreshing change of pace from Anderson's latest outings, including Fantastic Mr. Fox.Supporting roles from Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray, and Edward Norton help round out the delightful cast of characters, yet sometimes the hotel feels a bit too crowded. This may not matter much given that Fiennes and Revolori are the stars of the show, but it can be a bit jarring considering their limited screen time. Blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances from the likes of Owen Wilson can break up the film's quick and zippy pace, and one wonders if his character is entirely necessary or if Wilson appeared for simply fan service given Anderson's legendary cast.Anderson has constructed brilliant set pieces, once again employing his signature cinematography. The film is beautiful, using its visuals to its advantage to create some laugh- out-loud moments amidst the beautiful hotel. But you won't spend the entire time at the Grand Budapest. Excellent scenes within a prison are instantly memorable, as is the wonderful and exciting ski chase that will leave you in pieces.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a mastering of Anderson's craft. Some parts hilarious, other parts thrilling, you won't want to check out of the Hotel Grand Budapest. With a cast of unforgettable characters, including the legendary Gustave H, this is one of Anderson's best films to date, and it's definitely a must-see."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 June 2014,9/10,"I remember seeing a poster of this movie in my local cinema and what attracted to this movie was the cast. Most of them were my favourites so I went home and researched this movie and watched the trailer and it looked great! And when I went to see it, the film did not disappoint. I remember in the cinema it was only me and a friend that went to watch it and I left thinking that it was underrated and that it deserved so much more recognition. It was this film that got me into some of Wes Anderson's other movies and soon I became a fan of his films. I definitely would say he's one of my favourite directors. Anyway, this film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is about Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) who is a hotel concierge and his lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori) and after one of Gustave's mistresses passes away, he becomes a suspect and he and Zero are forced to run away and are lead on a very grand adventure. I definitely would say to anyone who is unsure of this to go and watch it, it might exceed your expectations. Overall, a great film with great actors."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,3/10,"What a disappointment! The story starts really slowly but had just enough detail and setting to keep me in my seat - at the 1 hour mark I wanted to leave. The sets are visually pleasing particularly the heavily wood panelled rooms and staircases of the buildings. The little models of the hotel are obviously that. The characters are bland as hell perhaps with the exception of the neurotic old lady near the beginning. The acting is deliberately very deadpan with some (correct?) idea that central Europeans are ultra reserved, uptight, solitary. The cameos are really annoying as they add absolutely nothing - no humour or intrigue. The script is wanting in the extreme and contains N. American language/swearing/syntax that is completely out of place in this film. The screen play needed desperately to be reworked a few more times with a twist or two to satisfy the audience. The audience - many older, seasoned movie veterans, sat in silence almost all of the time - two brave souls tried to applaud at the end but thought better of it. I had the impression this was an American film, with potential, that should have been handed over, in toto, to the Brits to make it much much better. In summary, it was a waste of $12 X 2."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 May 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that is equally perfect and sweet as one of the ""Mendl's"" pastry boxes so frequently featured in the story. It is like a box of presents tied firmly with a shiny silk ribbon. This is one of those movies you can enjoy on several distinct levels. The most striking layer of the movie, at least to me, is the use of colors, props and sets. The ever present pastels vary from earthly yellow to raspberry pink and then back to grays and browns. Some parts of the movie are shown in black & white, masterfully blended in the story so that they are hardly noticeable. The next layer comprises of the special makeup effects combined with the use of contact lenses and outrageous hairstyles which add to the visual attractiveness of the movie. The story, though funny and daring, does mostly serve as a scaffold supporting the visual treats that are masterfully plastered on it. The use of language and narrative techniques wrap the entire project up like the previously mentioned silk ribbon. Each and every cast member contributed immensely to the beauty of the project. Starting with supporting roles, it is simply impossible not to mention the very short but absolutely adorable appearance of Tilda Swinton who is transformed beyond recognition. Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel and many others contributed to the perfection of acting in individually flavored manner, blending seamlessly into the flow. Ralph Fiennes is adorable in his role of M. Gustave. His character is stimulated to brilliance by the performance of Tony Revolori. The intricate ballet the two perform serves as the backbone of the story. The sets are amazing. Models blend perfectly with the locations in the Czech Republic. Open spaces and winter scenery provide the canvas for the dynamic story telling. This is a visually stunning movie that may not please our average moviegoer. It is an exercise in masterful application of cinematic techniques and tools. I had a great time watching it and would wholeheartedly recommend it. You will most probably leave the cinema with a mischievous smile on your face."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 March 2014,8/10,"Great, how Amercian Filmmakers have discovered the Sächsische Schweiz and Görlitz. The shots in this film are beautiful and dreamy, it almost seems unreal. This part of Germany had also inspired Karl May to write his Winnetou, Apache Gold novels, supposedly never even having been to the US. The cast is fun to watch, it is amazing to see Ralph Fiennes again, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amalric. Adrien Brody and Jeff Golfblum make some very nice choices. Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan and Jude Law are so funny, they just use the right amount of slapstick. Harvey Keitel looks like no time passed passed since making ""The piano"". What a great ensemble. There are also some nice references to Sir Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. If you are a Wes Anderson and Stefan Zweig Fan, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a lot of fun."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2015,8/10,"I was never quite sure if this story within a story was meant to be a comedy or a tragedy, French or German, modern or period. It was delightfully puzzling, and I was generally excited to see what was going to happen next.It made the film artistic and cutting-edge, but also a little bit confusing. There was a great number of characters, locations, and plots to keep track of, all moving along at the fastest speed imaginable for a film.To actually follow the entire story required my fullest attention and focus. While that wasn't difficult for a movie that mostly kept me entertained; the flurry of cuts and transitions, narrated by several characters in both modern and period settings would've easily lost me at any given junction.It's artistic nature and rather... unique sense of humour made it enjoyable, to be sure, but it's the kind of movie you watch for the sake of having watched it. It reminded me of comical classics like 'Rat Race' and 'What's Up, Doc?'; but without the laid-back easy-to-watch nature.It's like someone took a classic comedy, filled it to its brim with characters on either side - without telling you who's a good guy and who isn't, and then cut it together like Inception; deliberately leaving the audience in the dark the whole time.It's funny, and delightful, and the protagonists are easy to love; but you would almost certainly need to watch it twice to take in the bombardment of story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 December 2017,9/10,"I tend to avoid finding out too much about the actual plot of movies I'm going to watch as possible, as I am easily distracted and it helps me focus on the story. As with most Wes Andersson movies though it turned out I really had no need to worry - whatever I thought I had figured the movie to be about beforehand was not even close to what I'd find.
The movie didn't have a single slow moment, always something going on. Camera angles, colouration and characters are quirky and swift as is Wes' characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson myself, though I did also enjoy Moonrise Kingdom which this movie do have similarities too both in how the story is told and the characters, but this is a movie I believe will do well even with the people that might not be into the slower, more artsy movies. Not only is it pretty to look at but there is also an epic adventure taking place that keep your eyes glued to the screen."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 December 2017,10/10,"Wes Anderson does it again by creating a movie that puts movie making back on the map! Watching this movie will stimulate all of your senses all at once. I could feel, see and taste the movie as I was watching it!!!!!! These types of movies are not for the faint of heart and the faint of laughter! Watch, see, feel, enjoy!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2017,3/10,"I feel sorry for the operators and all the other technicians that were recruited to produce this visually excellent picture about nothing. The script is so empty and devoid of any sense whatsoever that it made me question the emptiness I constantly feel inside my own life, and convince me that my life is actually full of wonder and magic compared to the dullness of this film's script. Wes Anderson must have indeed been on drugs. This movie is pure trash."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 January 2015,5/10,"It's a film that defies analysis, because frankly, there's no real meaning behind it. It's a bit of a sugary confection, with a very thin story and wholly unbelievable scenes, sets and characters. It's not quite interesting enough for fantasy, but it is probably well classified within that genre; absurdist fantasy. It departs from other absurdist films by this director in being quite untethered to any plausible reality, making it not quite nearly as compelling as some of his other, in my view, better films. Ralph Fiennes as a disappearing species in a disappearing milieu would be interesting if the film weren't so completely farcical. And so you have a kind of cartoonish mystery balancing on completely impossible and implausible scenarios carried out by mostly nonsensical characters, giving this film all the depth of a comic book. It's simply impossible to give a crap about any of it. The pastel-rich pastiche only adds to the sensation of being afloat in a sea of cake frosting. Not a great success, in my view, and hardly interesting enough, frankly, to have kept my attention from wandering."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 May 2020,10/10,"After watching hundreds of movies, you naturally forget some of them. This is a one almost impossible to forget, packed with adventure, comedy and drama.When I think of Wes Anderson I see colors, symmetry and visual aesthetics. Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson's aesthetic in a nutshell, and I could watch it again with muted dialogues just to admire the scenography. All the colors add a pleasant vibe to the story but don't make it overly cartoonish.The pace is slow at first, but don't let it fool you. As the actual plot of Zero's story begins, we see chase and fight sequences so good they could be in an action movie. Not to mention the numerous themes that are present throughout the story - and there's a whole lot. Friendship, loyalty, romance but also war, nostalgia and loss.Overall, it's not a movie, it's an experience. A story that's almost never-ending, because you can watch it again and relive it, and it will feel just as good as the first time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson's latest film was an absolute treasure. It was perfectly in line with Anderson's current cinematographic identity, with a visually perfect aesthetic, consistently vibrant colors and symmetrical balance in every shot. Having already seen a majority of the director, writer and producer's films, this was certainly one of his best. My only complaint with the film was the unusual use of gore, with which I believe the filmmaker was testing the waters. There were three brief, but alarmingly bloody and violent scenes, which did not exactly fit in with the style of the film or the director and were all-out unusual and unneeded. I hope that in his future films, Anderson omits this type of shock factor in the form of unnecessary gore.The film took the style of a story, within a story, within a story narrative. The bulk of the story took place in the far past, with the lobby boy, Zero played by a relatively new actor, Tony Revolori, and Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, the concierge of the titular hotel. As per usual Anderson used some of his favorite actors for this movie, namely Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody and Edward Norton, all of whom shined in their roles large or small. Fiennes led this all-star cast and was constantly charming and kept the viewers at the edge of their seat. At just over an hour and a half, this instant classic is certainly worth watching."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,6/10,"A friend invited me to see this. I wasn't aware this was a Wes Anderson film at first (busy lately, a bit behind on current events), but it was immediately apparent once the film started. Some of the visuals are really quite nice, but the pacing made the film kind of numbing. The humor felt flat and detached, and I was often more aware of the actors rather than the characters they played. That's not to say the performances were off, but more that some of them were a little distracting. This often happens (for me)when a large number of famous actors play small parts. I might have been more interested and entertained if the feel of the movie wasn't so predictably stylized."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 February 2015,10/10,"*** MINIMAL SPOILERS***It all starts with the story.Any successful Film, Novel, short story, etc., that is well-regarded and respected by audiences and creators alike all tend to agree that a great work starts with a great story.Add dashes of dark, black-magical comedy, sprinkled with exquisite European flavor, and plot elements of an episodic caper, the product is a modern masterpiece of the highest Cinematic quality.Many of the comedic elements are props such as the cactus in the Waiter's rooms, the three daughters of the deceased Madame X, and the valued painting, ""Boy with Apples"" all lend parts to link the plot to the humorous side of the movie.Cast was top-notch, superb. Not one actor seemed out-of-place. Cameos by Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and others boosted the Montage sequence of the other Concierges, belonging to the ""Cross-keys"" club, to a great level of acceptance of believability during M. Gustave's dire hour of true need.Without mentioning the main plot, let me state here that the ""war"" happens at close to mid- movie. The War hastens both Protagonists and Antagonists to act quickly to achieve their respective goals. The portrayal of the War men are next to actual Nazi's. However, Director Wes Anderson chose to change enough details to give the soldiers the appearance of Nazi's, and never naming them via dialogue. Even the flags were changed. Some will feel that Anderson should have just spit right out what and who they were, but after careful consideration after the third viewing, I decided that the former choice from Anderson was by far the wisest, in the name of good taste.That is not to say that Anderson did not hold back any notion of neutrality regarding the Soldiers; the way he shows how dumb they were is actually part of original writer Stephan Zweig's actual feelings and depictions of the Soldiers. Zweig, as many millions of other people, wanted the Nazi's to fail and did not hold back in telling so.The main characters, M. Gustave( Ralph Fiennes) and Mr. Moustafa( F. Murray Abraham/younger version by Tony Revolori) were fully developed; they were the story. Most of the other characters, such as Agatha( Saoirse Ronan) were developed enough for the audience to identify with the roles and parts they had in the story. Harvey Keitel's character, a prisoner, did not need much developing because he only serves the story as a prisoner that escapes with M. Gustave. Agatha is developed enough for us to see that she only sees herself as a cook/chef, but also is clever enough to save the day via the Mendl bakery-tool action, and her attempt to retrieve the Hitchcock-esque MacGuffin painting, ""Boy with Apple"".The Grand Budapest Hotel is a character in itself; the setting amongst the best background scenery in the world, the baths, the corridors, high ceilings, pastel colors, matching carpeting and walls, outdoor structures, gives you the feeling that you would enjoy your stay there. The Staff, at least in the days of M. Gustave, would have to be the best they could possibly be, and that element serves the story as well. The character M. Gustave, well-played by Ralph Fiennes. The ultimate Renaissance Man of the world of the 1930's, smooth as silk with the rich old ladies, gives many the impression of the casual wanna-be cad, but further development of M. Gustave shows that he is quite capable of mercy, teaching his portage(s) all of his own secrets of service, and can get tough when he needs to, like in that prison. M. Gustave was capable of loyalty, and restraint when his protégé did not like him flirting with Agatha. Willem Dafoe plays ""Jopling"", the ""Hit-Man/Enforcer"" for the Rich lady's children. Dafoe does a great job here.Back to original writer Zweig: he writes this beautiful story that has all human elements of emotions, such as greed, murderous plots, the Nazi takeovers of nearby lands in Europe on one hand, but the other has Moustafa meeting Aagatha, M. Gustave and his adventures, and Moustafa's great ability to recall everything as relayed to the young writer( Jude Law). Moustafa has lived a lot of his life in total loneliness, but not bitter. Moustafa hangs on to the treasured times with Agatha, and to some extent, M. Gustave.Zweig paints the picture of the Nazi's for the barbarians they truly were. In Zweig's world, even the Nazi's could not destroy man's hope, man's capacity to survive and outlast evil, and to flourish fully, as Moustafa surely did with Agatha.In conclusion, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a great movie. 10 for 10. No questions asked. This little movie takes the audience into another world, in another time, in other circumstances, albeit grim at times. Extremely enjoyable movie. Well paced, sharp dialogue, masterful cinematography.It all starts with the story..."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2014,10/10,"Immediately after watching the movie, my attention goes to the word ""Grand"" in the title. Perhaps this is the word which actually defines the movie.A murder mystery. A conspiracy. A Heist. A prison Break. A contract killer hunting people. And war. All this and much more shaped together inside a hilarious satire which deals with the shallow, careless and dying culture of aristocratic society of France because of unending wars. And to execute this with such perfection. The whole idea of the hotel in the movie exists as a charade to maintain the illusion of a rich and cultured society. This is definitely a ""Grand"" work of Cinema.Undoubtedly, The Grand Budapest Hotel is by far the best work by the Director Wes Craven. Maybe an Oscar nomination...Whatsay?"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 December 2014,6/10,"I do not get you people. What did you really see in this movie? I watched the trailer, watched the user reviews and the IMDb rating was also great. Those were the reasons to watch it. But in the middle of the movie I wanted it to end immediately. It was a real pain to watch it till the end. Nothing funny for a comedy and nothing good for a good movie. I trusted in this film because of Norton and Brody but I started cursing at the end and the IMDb rating is not the one that the really deserves. One of the most overrated rating on IMDb. Please, I recommend you all not to watch this."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 February 2015,10/10,"There have been several reviews panning this excellent film and I think I know the problem - people are not truly watching and experiencing this movie. It's an odd-ball sort of movie - def' a little quirky - but the key is to just open your mind and watch and not ""expect"" anything. Let things come to you as the director sends them. You must pay attention because the images and the dialog come quickly. It is a fast-paced movie so if you're attention wanders you will miss things. But I promise you if you have an open mind, an IQ somewhere above room-temperature and any sense of humor at all, you should really enjoy this little gem. We saw this movie on a home TV and I regretted that because I'll bet this film is absolutely outstanding on a big screen. It's not meant to be anything particularly deep or meaningful, just a fun couple of hours. Relax, and enjoy. It is well worth the watching!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 May 2014,8/10,"Once upon a time, in a place named after a rather tasty, flavored Polish vodka, there was a great hotel and an even greater concierge. Therein lies a cleverly conceived story within a story, which touches humorously, and occasionally darkly, upon almost every human emotion. Notable among these are love, lust, greed, fear, happy, sad, silly, and, of course, mad. We connect with these emotions mainly through the exploits of the main character, M. Gustave, the impeccably correct, near perfect concierge played by Ralph Fienes and his able, young protégé, Zero, played by Tony Revolori. Their acting is superb, aided by (usually) very well crafted screen writing,and story telling But there's more. The movie includes a veritable menagerie of wacky characters, many from the Anderson stable, and others, all of whom perform well. If you're an Anderson fan, the movie is a must see. If not, despite the fine acting and writing, and sets, the story could become a little tedious. But, should that be the case, you are urged to sit through the movie trailer, and its fascinating balalaika music, which will make all but the most sleepy person wake-up and feel good, before leaving the theater. Also, to celebrate your experience and if you like vodka, try to find Zubrowka (pronounced zha-broof-ka), and see what buffalo grass tastes like...I am convinced this movie was fun to make, and and should be fun to watch for all but the most literal minded and sober viewer."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 January 2015,10/10,"I do not relinquish 10 stars often. This movie is a monument to Wes Anderson and the art of movie-making. Less than a minute in, I KNEW I was watching a Wes Anderson movie; that little alarm in my head went off that said ""this movie's ""feel"", pace, clipped and precise diction, and the zoom in/zoom out and blocking remind me of Moonrise Kingdom!"" (Well, no kidding, Sherlock.)The cinematography is both awe-inspiring and will take your breath away... one feels as if you ARE there in war-torn Eastern Europe, with the vile, brash and harsh reality of war encircling you.The other reviewers here have covered all the bases. No sense in duplicating their commentary with the same lavishing of compliments. For a true delight, you MUST watch this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 August 2014,8/10,"finally got around to seeing this, ralph fiennes and willem dafoe are great. my only real complaint was that none of these great actresses and actors who featured and cameo'd attempted to adjust their accent for regional localisation of where the story is based... other than this the performances were great and the story provided plenty of intrigue and fascination,this combined with wes anderson's great direction and some nice cinematography, along with fantastic set design made for quite a captivating film. i'm not sure if it's my favourite wes anderson film, but its definitely up there with some of his best for me."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2019,10/10,"I can see why this movie might be divisive among people, the storyline is complicated and the dialouge can seem stilted at times, but I cannot deny the profound effect it had on meThere are very few movies that I have finished and wanted to watch again immediately after but this is one of them. Every shot is like a piece of art, and there is just this sense that the world being displayed is not our own but like some surreal Wes Anderson-land.Although it is unlike the real world it still manages to portray this true feeling of melancholy that I have simply not experienced with any other movie.While I do not think it is a flawless movie I do think it something everyone should see once."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 October 2021,4/10,"No meaningful plot, no thrill, just: hmm...A waste of time, if you like such comical films watch Sin City... much better. Only having a good cast doesn't make a good film. Don't understand why people rate this film high... maybe everyone thinks it's super intelectual."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2014,6/10,"This fun fantasy film meanders it's along nice and gently without making you laugh out loudor jump or cry but it does make you smile. It's a pantomime on film. One member of the audience laughed out loud , but she was the only person in the cinema. It is a film for the open minded for the person who can see fun in lunacy. How ever ithe film will not be to everyone's taste one friend just didn't get it. Some people won't. It's deliberately amateurish effects will amuse some and bemuse others. It is good but not as good as Wes Anderson's previous films, the life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums, Even though I enjoyed the film I know it could have been much better and was not better than what he has made to date.Its a fun watch, but don't expect too much."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 February 2016,9/10,"This is not a new film but I watched it again yesterday and I every time time I have the pleasure to watch I remember why I love it so much! This movie is basically a story within a story. In fact it starts in the present with a girl in a park reading a book, in front of a monument of the author. In the book The Author is sitting at his desk in 1985 and narrates the trip he made in 1968 to The Grand Budapest Hotel where he met Mr. Moustafa, who told him the story of how he became the owner of the hotel. And again we go back, to 1932, when M. Gustave was the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. The most wonderful thing about this storytelling is how cleverly is done. The present is shot in 16:9, the trip he made in 1968 is shot in classic cinema ratio 2.35:1 and the story of M. Gustave and Zero, the lobby boy, is portrayed in 4:3. The directing by Wes Anderson here is at his best. I absolutely love his style and the work he's done here is outstanding. A hand of applause to the cinematography as well, simply marvellous. This movie is an incredible pleasure to watch. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you wonder what they're going to find themselves in next. It's a masterpiece of soft comedy narrated through bright colours and wonderful photography. And even with Birdman as an opponent this film managed to win 4 of the 9 Oscars it was been nominated for. Surely if The Grand Budapest Hotel came out in a different year it would have won Directing, Writing and Cinematography as well. But as I always say Oscars don't make a movie better and this film is absolutely fantastic as it is, with or without those Academy Awards."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 June 2014,1/10,"1.over hyped,overrated,overrated director who makes you sleep 2.Maybe nominated for Oscar 3.Praised by critics 4.its comedy but you wont laughfor god sake don't believe the critics its boring except for beautiful cinematography 1 star for that.2. aspect ratio i know they try to make it look like classic old lookingbut why are we reading a book this is waste with beautiful cinematography its should be wide screen come on every oneeveryone knows which scenes is flash back 3. last things is just boring,forgettable film ever made."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 April 2020,8/10,"Wes Anderson keeps evolving and it's beautiful. The storytelling, the use of backgrounds, foregrounds, the sets, its like its own world! One thing I like about this movie most is the positions of each character in a shot is very locatable even if its a chaos going on in the scene, this is the most ""Wes Anderson"" movie till date."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2018,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is fantastic. Wes Anderson puts so much work into every film he's made. He's a great filmmaker, and he has really out done himself here. The style and cinematography always matches the time period and place. His style is amazing. He uses lighting and shot placement to establish emotions in a very affective way. Every shot is symmetrical and every pan, or zoom, or tracking shot is mastered and used to great affect. He makes intentional mistakes and uses different aspect ratios so he can make you feel like you are watching a film from whatever time period the scene is taking place in. Ralph Fiennes is great in this movie. I think he gave the best male performance of 2014, and he was snubbed. Anyway besides the style , the comedic script is very good. The way it sets the tone, it really is an escape from reality. The only (very minor) complaint is that there was one sequence where they used CGI which would have been betterif they used practical effects. Other than that it was an absolute joy to watch and I will defiantly be watching it again. I give it a 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2020,10/10,The Wes Anderson aesthetic is too over powering like I felt is was in Moonrise Kingdom solid plot with lots of funny bits that work well. Would recommend
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 March 2019,7/10,"This great scenes make you full of joy ,colorful and intelligent , this is what i can say about this fantasy movie , of course i don't like the murderer individual."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 June 2020,8/10,"I like this cartoon way in directing and I like this genius comedy .
But I have one noting which is the movie would PG_13 if the director change some comedy moments"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2021,8/10,"This is my first live-action Wes Anderson film. I have already seen ""Isle of Dogs"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is, quite frankly, a really fun movie to watch. Wes Anderson's visual style is a real treat. The characters are also very fun and interesting too. I like the story a lot, but I wish Dimitri got more screen time as one of the other villains of the film. The actual hotel is really well-designed. The story within a story bit is pretty cool as well. Wes Anderson's style is very distinct and impressive, I would highly recommend you watch this film if you haven't already."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 October 2021,8/10,"An enjoyable work of art, brilliantly bizarre and fun. The cinematography and storytelling was spell binding, with characters that took you far and wide. A comedy of sorts, Anderson shone with this."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 June 2014,10/10,"I really can't say that I was overcome with particular emotions during this movie as I sat next to my girlfriend (who isn't a movie person), but I can honestly say that this movie made my life better by seeing it. It was a wickedly creative story that fed intelligent viewers nectar of the gods.The Grand Budapest Hotel was a masterfully written story, and without looking at the credits I can say that the director also deserves much of the fanfare. Ralph Fiennes proves he is easily one of the best actors on this planet by his portrayal of Gustav. I don't recall one point in the movie were he wasn't flawless! William DeFoe is easily one of the best ""wingman"" an actor can have. Mr. Abraham did not ""kill Mozart"", and was pleasantly appealing.Casting was great, cinematography was intelligent, art direction delightful, writing superb, production of this was made to look like child's play! Seriously, I'm going to rave to everyone, even my Republican friends who will not understand what an accomplishment of a movie this is!Thank you all of you who put this together! I would have paid $50 for a ticket! Funny I just looked up the director and I will definitely view his other works.....except the Royal Tenenbaums, because I already loved that movie! Great Job to ALL! Perfect Movie!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2014,9/10,"I love this movie very much. It seems all great star come into one movie and this is very fabulous. I have no doubt that every cast can act, even the maid played by Lea Seydoux! I used to see this movie because of promising cast, but its not over.... the setting is wonderful: hotel, train, shop, jail all perfectly spoiled your eyes in good way. The make up artist are amazing, all cast costume are neatly made, flawless not glamorous but well-liking. The music score are well heard. the movie detail are surprisingly great, you can read at the goofs. However, for some reason i don't have a good credit for the story. The story are not great for me. Some may say this is twisted of sad-funny movie and its brilliant, but as i watch it till the end, i find the story are empty and meaningless."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 August 2015,5/10,"It is as though Wes Anderson is in competition with himself to see how many of the same actors he can put in each of his movies. With The Fantastic Mr. Fox and even Moonrise Kingdom is was delightful to see the actors we had once seen and loved in the Royal Tenenbaums. But this film was so ridiculously packed with every single actor who had ever appeared in any Anderson film that is was not only annoying but also greatly distracting from the plot. I feel as though this film is a parody of what his films once were, so full of quirk and color and famous actors that the plot (what weak a plot there was) was completely overshadowed. And to find that this was the one film to win an Oscar was greatly disappointing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 February 2014,,"The Film Authority reviews The Grand Budapest HotelWes Anderson's eclectic films have sometimes seemed burdened by the cinema of the past; The Royal Tennenbaums recalls John Irving's The Hotel New Hampshire, while The Darjeeling Limited references Indian cinema. By looking back to the writings of Austrian humorist Stefan Zweig, whose The World of Yesterday is suffused by nostalgia, Anderson finds a common soul to work with, and the result is a complex, over-stuffed but frequently delightful film, at odds with modern fashions. Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave H, a concierge at a glamorous eastern-European hotel who takes an interest in a lobby-boy Zero (Tony Revolori). Gustave has a secret passion for the elderly Madame D (Tilda Swinton), but when she dies, an act of art-theft sets himself up as her killer, and Gustave and Zero break out of jail to attempt to clear his name. Told through flashbacks between an older Zero (F Murray Abraham) and an interested writer (Jude Law), The Grand Budapest Hotel is busy even by Anderson's standards, with cameos from Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson and a host of other familiar faces. The effect is charming, in that it evokes a past where character and style were omnipresent, contrasting nicely with the somewhat tatty setting of Zero's recollection. The Grand Budapest Hotel has lots of comic situations, and even if there are fewer laughs, the elaborate staging and cheerful air of anything-goes storytelling will ender it to a small but passionate group of cinema-goers. Fiennes wasn't first choice for the role, and he plays it with gusto, and the whole cast seem to be in on the joke, especially Harvey Keitel as a spry inmate of the jail. The Film Authority"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,4/10,"I attended this film with my wife and an absolutely packed theatre of moviegoers. My wife fell asleep (literally) and about two hundred others around us sat in uninterrupted silence as a litany of dreary antics and pratfalls ensued. Truthfully, there were no more than a handful of audible giggles throughout the entire length of the film. Personally, I found it mildly humorous at best. One interesting aspect was watching the long list of cameo appearances by so many well-known names, while the story, within a story, within a story narration was mildly intriguing. The chase scene in the snow was insufferably long and cartoonish. Such a disappointment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,8/10,"I have not seen any of Wes Anderson's work, but after watching this i am keen to watch more of his films. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a story about the concierge of the hotel and its lobby boy's attempt to escape from a murder framed on Ralph Fiennes(The concierge)by one of the characters in the film. I am not revealing anything to you , its just the sheer work of absolute brilliant filmmaking and the extraordinary idea of creating a mind boggling effect by putting three different screen ratios for three different era's. the screen ratios are perfect and have absolutely well blended with the different cinematography and production design used in this film. Ralph Fiennes' performance was wonderful as well as that of F. Murray Abraham's. I would recommend every one of you who is reading my review to watch this splendid movie right now, because this is a ride that you should not miss."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 January 2021,4/10,"Every frame of this movie is a painting, but I quickly found myself wishing for paint thinner. This movie isn't about anything. Nothing happens. It has no purpose, no direction, and no soul. It's boring and a waste of time, and I regret even renting it from Netflix except that it gave me the opportunity to come up with my ""paint thinner"" line, which I am proud of. It's like Goodburger, except instead of a burger restaurant, it's a hotel. And instead of being a good movie, it's a bad movie, and instead of burgers it's a guy or something. Imagine a TV edit of The Shining."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 July 2014,8/10,"I enjoyed this film. It was a classic Wes Anderson experience: I do not mean this in any derogatory way, merely that this film had all the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson movie. I went in to see this film without any preconceptions or having read any background information and it was clear from the start that this was a Wes Anderson flick. And I really enjoyed it. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as were all the starring and supporting actors, the story clipped along apace, the scenes were all beautifully shot and choreographed, this film is a great piece of art. The story may appear fantastical because of the way it is told, however the underlying tale is believable, not ridiculous. The small cut- scene animations that give the film some of its quirkiness are perfectly proportioned to keep the story moving along, explaining the action without slowing down the plot. Some of the characters are one-dimensional, but this fits in perfectly with the telling of the tale. A very enjoyable movie and one that will be even better on the second viewing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,5/10,"It seems like Wes Anderson is getting more morbid with the content of his movies. I noticed it in Moonrise Kingdom and now the grand Budapest hotel. I don't really don't mind morbidness, more than I mind graphicness. I mean, I liked Moonrise Kingdom, and I thought it was interesting that he broke away a little bit from his usual style in someways by making it a bit darker, but now we have yet another film (Budapest)...and it was a lot more graphic. And some of it was unnecessary if you ask me...why did it have to be so graphic? For example: in past Anderson films an animal usually always dies (like the dog in royal Tenenbaums) but they usually don't show the animals dead...but for some reason in Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest they do choose to show this. Usually Anderson is not very graphic or disturbing, but then we have fingers getting cut off and decapitated heads in 'Budapest'. I also remember a bit of graphicness from Moonrise Kingdom. Why is he now suddenly deciding to add this kind of macabre to his films? And why is he doing it when it is really unnecessary? I mean, I know that there was a finger cut off in Royal Tenenbaums...but we didn't actually have a close up of a cut off finger, that is just gross and unnecessary! And I know that the royal Tenenbaums had the suicide with a razor scene, which was pretty graphic, but that actually WAS necessary in my opinion to show for the purpose of the story. Granted in the 'Budapest' the blood looked very fake...Ketchup obviously....but still it was disturbing. I know that Anderson is trying to be more like Peter Greenaway, but quite frankly I think Greenaway does it better.I almost left the theater after this, and well....some other things bothered me like some choppy sloppy editing in certain transitions within some scenes...and also some real time period inaccuracies like the plated glass in the prison (this wasn't in prisons in those days) and CPR and mouth to mouth wasn't around in the 1930s. I also thought the casting was really bizarre for the bell boy and J. Murray Abraham as the older 'Zero.' I mean i like Abraham and he is a really good actor...but they could have at least tried to use some makeup or something to make him look like a darker skinned man. I thought the cinematography was amazing...and I thought there was an interesting meaningful story.....although it sort of confused me in the end. But yeah...not sure I'm going to be able to say that I was a fan of this Anderson project...even though in the past I've been a fan of all the other Anderson movies...although Moonrise wasn't really a favorite of mine either... even though I did leave the theater feeling like I saw a good movie, it was a little too dark for me."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 June 2020,10/10,"TGBH is one of my favourite films ever.It's aesthetic is visually pleasing and colourful which makes every scene a joy to watch. Furthermore, when paired with the very fun score from Desplat it gives even the most quirky scene a hint of suspense and tension (such as Deputy Kovac's run from Jopling).Its dark tongue in cheek humour is perfectly timed and not too overdone.The plot is very complicated but certainly not impossible to understand, however this wonderful film is one to entertain, rather than to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat; therefore I would recommend to a first-timer to try and enjoy it rather than to try and keep up and figure out the story.It is a shame that Wes Anderson did not receive any Academy Awards for this masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 February 2020,10/10,"Wes Anderson is an artistic genius disguised as a storyteller. Period.In The Grand Budapest Hotel he presents a moving art canvas with actors juxtaposed in every frame. A true visual treat with impeccable story telling. A symphony to the ears, colourful feast to the eyes and enlightenment to all senses. Watch to experience it, savour it and reminisce. Even ten out of ten would be an injustice."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2017,10/10,"This is a movie with many layers.Watch it for the story, the scenery, the direction, and the action, THEN watch it for the fantastic graphic work, a tour de force of signage, props, paper ephemera, even the carpeting, are all masterworks of design. Adam Stockhausen and his lead graphic designer, Annie Atkins, did fantastic work, this film will be shown as an example to film designers for years to come."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 February 2020,10/10,In my opnion its the best wes anderson film its awfully strange in a good way but i could understand why someone would not like it becuase its strange you just need to imbrase it to fully enjoy it
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 May 2019,10/10,"I enjoyed this film so much . it's funny ,well performed and well dircted . an amazing job from wes Anderson ."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 January 2015,1/10,"I have given this film 1/10, only because it is not possible to rate it zero. I don't know why I never learn: ever since Rushmore, a film to which I simply could not warm up, every time I watch one of Wes Anderson's films, I end up disliking it intensely. That was the case with Rushmore, then The Royal Tennenbaums, followed by Moonrise Kingdom, and now The Grand Budapest Hotel. Two of my good friends, whose judgment in films I trust, told me what a great film this was. With that in mind, I began watching it, but within 20 minutes, I realized I would not like the film, just as I had not enjoyed watching the other Anderson films before. One reason was the manic pace at which the actors delivered their lines and the musical score rolled; another was how completely indifferent to their predicaments the characters left me. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a pretentious film, in which visual style stifles any substance its talented actors might have brought to the story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2020,9/10,"The best way of describing The Grand Budapest Hotel is an art piece; all thanks to the film's stunning visuals due to the auteur, Wes Anderson.The entire film is so mesmerising due to its unique and artful framing, be its use of: wide shots which are often accompanied with great puppetry work adding so much charm; symmetry being utilised to make many shots looks like a painting; and or the change of aspect ratio between decades which, in combination with the use of dull and bright colours, makes it easily distinguishable and engaging to watch.The writing was also exceptional, balancing its witty comedy while still maintaining some of it's dark undertones. All the main and side characters had great personalities with all their respective actors giving their full efforts. Ralph Fiennes absolutely killed his role giving a lot likability presenting very memorable lines with an equally memorable performance.The runtime is justified with every scene always serving a purpose and in combination with it's fast paced dialogue keeps its pacing sharp, keeping me on my toes until its end."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 December 2020,10/10,"(modification of former review, please kindly change.)Impressive!! This masterpiece contains not only ""Symmetrical"" but also ""Circulation"", in the point of view of Classical Music - 'cyclic music', for example Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, Frank and so on. As shown it, Classical music composers, Gustave(Gustav Mahler), Dmitri(Dmitrii Dmitrievich Shostakovich), Ludwig(Ludwig van Beethoven) and Wolf(Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) appear Cyclically in this story. Are these conscious or not?"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 July 2021,8/10,"Pure innocents and optimism beautifully contrasted with our sad reality. No director is able to jump through time as well as Wes Anderson. Instead of bogging down what could be convoluted stories with unnecessary transitionary periods, he simply just, cuts away. Sometimes with a title card saying when/where and/or the reason why, sometimes without. And he does this like he does everything, the way he wants to. Everything Wes does is utterly Wes and there's almost nothing better than Wes' individuality perfected. There's almost nothing better than 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 February 2021,5/10,"Not for those who watch for entertainment, you can skip this movie"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 June 2014,7/10,"I watched The Grand Budapest Hotel knowing that it would be a whole new cinematographic experience. Wes Anderson is a true genius when it comes to visual aesthetic; the hotel's decor is splendid, with plenty of small details in the background that I couldn't take my eyes of.This movie clearly has the Wes Anderson's signature, the story telling, the dialogs, the story's rhythm, the costumes... everything is clearly from his unique universe. So if you are like me me a big fan of Moonrise Kingdom or The Royal Tenenbaums, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a must-seen.The originality of the plot comes from this peculiar journey you're getting into. It is a bit of a thriller, with a murder case to solve, a bit of a love story, with the young love between Zero and Agatha, friendship and loyalty are also important themes that make the movie full of humanity. All of these aspects are told through characters that are colorful and truly appealing, the ensemble's acting is right on spot. One of the best cast this year.All in all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a poetic journey, I couldn't find anything negative about it, even the soundtrack is perfect. So, go watch it or you'll pass on something big!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 February 2016,10/10,"(Contains spoilers): What I like about certain scenes in the movie is the way they turn certain film clichés on their heads, with unexpected results. The most obvious one is when Serge's sister's head comes out of the basket, instead of Agathe's, which we are led to expect. Another one is when Gustave is accosted by the police in the lobby and accused of the crime. The expected follow-up is that the accused will stand there and try to talk his way out of it, but Gustave unexpectedly hightails it. Another more subtle one is the scene in the prison when Gustave is serving mush. When he serves it to the ferocious-looking convict, we expect that guy to go into a rage, a la the guy in the prison mess scene in ""Stir Crazy"", but the convict likes it.There are probably more of these things that other people can spot. Then, on top of those are the references to other films: Jopling cracking the ice from under Gustave on the cliff, a la ""North by Northwest"", and the cable car transfer, a la each least one Bond movie. All in all, a totally funny movie that has to be seen many times to get all the funny bits. (How about the gas station with the big ""FUELITZ"" sign over it!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson's style was so enjoyable with this lovely story. I've seen other films by him like Moonrise Kingdom and Bottle Rocket, but this is by far my favorite. This movie has characters that are charming and endearing along with a funny story. My absolute favorite thing about this movie was the dialogue between M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and any of the other characters. He was just perfectly hilarious while being so well mannered and polite. Movies with delicious looking food is also a plus. The bakery pastries looked so cute along with everything else in this gorgeous film. The mansion, hotels, and even the prison settings were wonderful to look at. It sort of also reminded me of the movie A Series Of Unfortunate Events. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes bittersweet funny movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2014,10/10,"Artistically a triumph, cinematographically peaking with experiments (variating dimension viewing formats e.g. 16:9, 4:3, 16:10 e.t.c. regardless from their cinematic-friendly potentials), and finally some screen writing common sense providing narrative coherence (the technique of off-narration hadn't been used thus, since the time of Good Fellas and Casino)with deliberate and tight pacing of rhythm, that maximizes suspense and leads into a grand finale only to retrieve back into the opening sequences once more.. i'm not commenting on the all - star cast performances, or on the intriguing music score, which were more than adequate and efficient to finally help the filmmaker visualize this wonderful project. At last a clear and undisputed nomination for cinematic Brilliance!! If the music band tool ever made a film this one easily could be it!! A film that many contemporary creators should envy.."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 March 2014,8/10,"Believe it or not, Wes Anderson has not directed as many films as you would have thought. A quick check reveals The Grand Budapest Hotel to be but his eighth full feature directorial release in 20 years - following not so hot-on-the-heels from love them or remain indifferent to them classics such as The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. Regardless, Anderson has undoubtedly solidified an unmistakable style in terms of both directing and writing, and these trademarks prove wonderfully showcased in his latest and, for me personally, best ensemble comedy to date.Anderson's magic always begins with an eclectic cast of surreal characters placed in equally surreal situations in a colourful environment, and The Grand Budapest Hotel is the perfect setting for this magic to flourish. The storybook setting, creatively realised via huge, open sound stages designed to assist the madcap camera-work - in turn intended to compliment the gleefully live-action cartoon effect showcased by the well chosen cast – gives the feel of a pantomime in a giant doll house. Added to this is a conscious decision to film the different eras represented in the story with different aspect ratios, which helps to distinguish and frame each time period with its own character. The use of rudimentary models for action scenes and some establishing shots, coupled with purposefully old school slower film speeds, also contributes to the goal of translating the film kinetically via 1930s principles/limitations. It may be aesthetically overbearing at times – and for harsher critics perhaps a bit pretentious – but I found Anderson's choices for visuals exercised a character in keeping with the spirit of the meticulously executed overall tone.The star of the show is one Gustave H., deliciously portrayed by Ralph Fiennes who, it can safely be said, leaves absolutely nothing in his locker for this particular gig. Gustave H. is the concierge for the title's establishment, and is immediately recognisable as a figure of regimented ethics and high standards in how he runs his premises and also lives his life. Imagine Basil Fawlty's even more eccentric uncle and you're halfway there. 'Quirky' is of course another way to describe Gustave H. and his actions, and overused as this descriptive term can be in Anderson flicks, it is also undeniably the case. Especially when one of Gustave H.'s main taboos is bedding any and all of the hotel's elderly guests. And when I say elderly, I mean almost two feet in the grave elderly.The key relationship of the film is that of Gustave H. and new lobby boy 'Zero', played by newcomer(ish) Tony Revolori. Their dynamic offers a buddy comedy angle throughout the whole film and works well if not only because of the great individual performances of the actors themselves, but also for the sweetness and subtly developing bond between them as the story unfolds. Zero aspires to be Gustave H., while Gustave H. sees Zero as the chance to fashion himself anew. Their relationship has barely kicked off before the runaway train of a narrative involving heists, prison breaks and snowy-mountain chases takes over, but this does not hinder their interactions as they are joined at the hip most of the time – hilariously so when they often are sharing the same costumes or offering the same reactions as if Zero was the 'Mini Me' of Gustave H.The cast as a whole, impeccably blocked for the sake of a relentlessly charming matinée-style presentation, is a satisfying mix of Anderson faithfuls and newcomers, as well as providing the rare treat of getting to see Bill Murray on the big screen once more (okay there was also The Monuments Men this month!). Dafoe gets to sneer about looking like Nosferatu in his part-time job as a henchman (ironic considering Shadow Of The Vampire!), Ronan blesses us with her versatile presence once more, and there are plenty of scenes where the eternal 'I know him/her!' question will pop into your head – its one where you'll almost certainly be double-checking IMDb filmographies upon leaving the auditorium! (not during of course – that would be rude . . . switch it off!) They all contribute solidly to assist what is admittedly only a fairly interesting and arguably throwaway story based loosely on the writings of someone you're likely to have never heard of. However, even by the time secret societies and family conspiracies are let loose on the plot, you should be having too much fun to really care where the story wants to go next.Even though it is his most recent addition, The Grand Budapest Hotel would serve as a great entry point to anyone wanting to get started on Wes Anderson's filmography as it represents all the positive aspects of his talent – serving up smile-inducing comical moments via surreal circumstances and utilising great talent to realise his 'quirky' vision. The premise, plot and characters fit with their director wonderfully, and the film just feels like its always eager to please. Gustave H. could easily be speaking about the director when he utters the line towards the end ""he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvellous grace"". It may feel like its hanging on to the good intentions of its viewers at times, but if you fall for this one you're sure to fall for his others – so make sure to visit Anderson's other attractions as soon as you can!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,2/10,"I hadn't heard of this film when I and my wife decided to watch it on Sky a couple of days ago and I was stunned when I heard today it was up for multiple Oscars.We couldn't make it past about 40 minutes - it literally did nothing for us at all. It just seemed dull, awkward and a bit too arty at the expense of plot.I don't mind films starting slow and laying the foundations for the characters and the plot. But this film just didn't appear to be offering me any incentive to stick with it.Maybe we were missing something. Or maybe this is one of those films you're supposed to like even if you don't"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 June 2014,9/10,"splendid. beautiful, remarkable, wonderful. This movie, I love it. Unique, lovely, funny, and the whole things are amazing. Wes Anderson always done great, his movies always have unique things as inspiration for another movie maker. The shots are great, they always put the person in the middle of the frame. The color is wonderful, and it just like a pop up book. And the way the movie tells us about story in a story in a story is really great. The one who play as Zero is great, actually. And I wonder why this movie is not so popular, the cast are popular. This kind of movie is worth to watch, worth to keep, and worth to love."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2014,1/10,"This was the first movie I ever walked away before it ended, actually just an hour after it started.I am sorry but I could not cope with so much silliness, stupidity, bad acting and confusion. I think that even some of those American teenage movies are more fun than this one.In fact the photography of the movie is very nice, I liked the buildings, the style, as I admire heritage buildings but this was the only thing this movie could offer really.I had high expectations of this movie but it ended up being the worst disappointment I ever had.Terrible !"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 August 2014,9/10,"A period piece that evokes a bygone age that (probably) never existed as depicted here, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a brightly coloured journey through a landscape populated by wonderfully imagined eccentrics. The script, cast and cinematography are of the highest order and the narrative, though hardly original, feels fresh and new and holds the attention for the duration. Most importantly, it makes the viewer care about what happens and who it happens to.Ralph Fiennes is centre stage, and gives one of the finest performances of his career as the concierge of the titular establishment. Newcomer Tony Revolori is equally impressive as his sidekick and protégé. He deserves to go on to great things.There are many Big Names in the cast including 4 Oscar winners and 11 nominees, most of them in much smaller roles than usual, and none of them disappoint. In fact, most of them seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. And Tilda Swinton is clearly having the time of her life!To sum up, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a wonderful, imaginative, eccentric and glorious tale that never forgets that it's main purpose is to to tell a story. A magnificent success."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2021,9/10,It is hard to find any flaws or weaknesses in this well thought and well done movie even after multiple times of watching.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 February 2015,5/10,"I was excited to see this movie because of the interestingly different setting and amazing cast but it fell way short of what I expected. It was interesting at the beginning and was funny very little. The story was not very exciting and lost my interest half way through the movie because it was all over the place. It is extremely hard to make me fall asleep while watching a movie but this one almost did it for me a little more than half way through the film. I saw a lot of potential in this with a story that could have been at least decent, the cast was great but they brought nothing of their own to the table. It even had a great deal of meaning to it but should have been more implemented throughout instead of just the end. This movie was a disappointment in my eyes and could have been much better than this mediocre five I hate giving to it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 May 2020,9/10,"Razor sharp script; outstanding casting; and very funny. The production design has a lush colour palette and above all the camera work is to die for
It bears many repeated viewings
Don't miss"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 June 2019,9/10,"As one can guess by the title of this review, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one heck of a film. No, this isn't just a movie but also a fine specimen of the artistic brilliance of Wes Anderson and the team.
Admittedly, I'm rather late to the party and shamefully enough, I have not been witness to much of Anderson's work. But, that doesn't stop me from appreciating the fact that TGBH has aged like fine wine.
The frames are so immaculately shot yet so simple when you think about it. There's a sort of mechanical precision in the way Anderson and his DP capture the story. The grandeur of the setting is expressed beautifully and use of colour and the colour theory is so damn well-done!
The characters are so....unique. And interesting. And engaging. It's as if I'm reading literature, there's some sort of 'literary texture' in the way they speak, interact and move. So engrossing!
The plot itself is not really complex and is rather straightforward and even comical at times. It's really absurd and that's Anderson's whole shtick, isn't it?As you can see, I cannot stop gushing over this film! It's safe to say that it's certainly one of the better ones I've seen in a WHILE.Solid 9/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 May 2014,5/10,"I didn't check the spoiler box, because in order to spoil the plot, there would have to be a plot.Imagine, if you will, a parody of Wes Anderson films. It's impossible because that's what he does.There's no plot because he doesn't need one and it would be unnecessary anyway. There's no character development because the usual suspects are already there and his celebrity cameo players have already established their characters.Yes there are funny parts, but after the first half hour you've seen all of them and the rest is just tedious.If you are a Wes Anderson fan, you will love this, if not stay away because this has all been done before."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 September 2018,8/10,"Pros: all the characters are perfectly played (they will be remembered for a long time), puppety, which was not in any film before, a good storyMinuses: a little boring, average graphics.
Minuses: a little boring , average graphic."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,1/10,"I am thoroughly shocked and dismayed that this movie received so many nominations at the Oscars. My whole family hated this movie. The movie is filled with nothing but quirky and whimsical scenes that do not develop the characters or even provide a storyline. Essentially, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" uses the same technique but a different location from previous movies by Wes Anderson. I used to take the angry and critical comments about Oscar-nominated or -awarded movies with a grain of salt, since I could see some value in many nominated movies in the past. Now I have absolutely no faith in the Oscar nomination process since they clearly want to pick and choose movie makers who do something ""different"" with their movies. It reminds me of the fable of the emperor with no clothes. I know that I will always avoid any movies made by Wes Anderson in the future."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 May 2020,10/10,"1500x better than Birdman, this comic crime drama is now a classic. Wes Anderson amazingly puts together this fun film packed with stars and uses his comic palette and slapstick style. Overall the film is perfect for a small laugh and Saturday night!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2021,10/10,"This film grabbed my attention from the get-go with its quirky looks and fantastic cast. It's got a brilliant comedic side to it, along with an intriguing storyline and great performances throughout.This is surely Wes Anderson's best film, and I would go so far as to say, this is one of the best films ever made. Certainly one of the best films I've seen. Well worth watching! - 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 November 2021,10/10,"I thought it was going too be to high brow and boring, but it wasn't . Great great acting and very funny and interesting. William Dafoe was great. Great views of Europe."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2015,10/10,"Dir: Wes Anderson Stars: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Tilda SwintonIn his new comedy, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson has found an elegant solution to gripes about how stifling, how annoyingly perfect, his films can be. He ignores them wholeheartedly. Obsessive design which forbids any sense of spontaneity? Check. Feelings put in inverted commas, or swept aside to concentrate on the colour palette? Check that too. Non-devotees might be bracing themselves, but the scales could just as easily fall from their eyes when they sit down to watch this. The trouble is: it's wonderful. It does all of the above, and it's still wonderful. You could get light-headed on the pure fun of it, which unleashes fresh waves of fun-within-fun at every point where you worry it might dry up. There are three prologues, each nested within the last as storytelling conceits to bring us back, in stages, to 1932, and Chapter 1. Here we're introduced to the story's prime mover – a famous concierge called Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), who is the meticulous heart and soul of his establishment, a monumental pink palace perched high up somewhere in a misty Mitteleuropean mountain range. The will of one eminent guest, an 84-year-old widow called Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, becomes the contested centre of a farcical bust-up between Gustave and her money-grubbing family. Brief as it is, the role of this old lady is vastly enlivened by having a magnificently crusty and bizarre-looking Tilda Swinton play it. Madame D departs the Grand Budapest on the same day that a young lobby boy called Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) first comes to the concierge's attention. Gustave must school this pup in the ins and outs of the hotel, not least explaining his own peculiar role in the sex lives of its weathered residents. ""When you're young, it's all fillet steak,"" he tells his new protégé, ""but as you get older, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2015,8/10,"I have to start by saying that this is my first Wes Anderson film. The title piqued my interest so I decided to give it a try. I am not disappointed at all. The actors performed exceptionally well and the characters in the story came out naturally. Comedy hits you in the face and it is there throughout the movie at unexpected places. Even though some jokes were slapstick, it was subtly portrayed. The background score gave life to different situations and the music was cheerful throughout the movie. It takes a genius of a writer to convert what seems to be a conventional drama into a murder mystery.The settings were lively and the landscapes and scenarios were beautiful. 10 points for Witty dialogs combined with exquisite poetry."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 July 2014,10/10,"Wes keeps killing dogs and cats in most of his movies and this evil sh*t needs to stop.It's not funny.Has anyone else noticed this? WES--STOP KILLING ANIMALS IN YOUR MOVIES!!Some day, an animal loving producer(S) will not give you the directing job. I even watched the ENTIRE end credits to Grand Budapest Hotel and there is NOTHING that says ""no animals were harmed"". A cat is killed this time.SHAME ON YOU WES. BE KIND TO ANIMALS IF YOU WANT MORE KUDOS ********** ********(Wes is also sexist as there 1-2 women for every 12 men in his films but that is another issue)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson's new film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is as colorful and intriguing as its poster. The cast is a mix of familiar faces, such as Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, and fresh faces, like newcomer Tony Revolori. Whether they are familiar or not, it is a delight to watch the actors play with their parts – with Ralph Fiennes in one of his greatest parts to date.The Grand Budapest Hotel is about (you guessed right!) the Grand Budapest Hotel, a pink guest house on the top of a mountain somewhere in Europe in the 1930's – the guests actually have to travel with a mount-elevator to the hotel. The film zooms in on the colorful characters who stay, work and live at the Grand Budapest, centering around eccentric concierge Gustave H. and his lobby-boy, Zero. When a well respected guest and very dear friend of Gustave H. mysteriously dies, a Renaissance-painting is left to the concierge, although the relatives of the deceased are not too happy about this. When Gustave H. decides to steal the painting, the adventures of the concierge and the lobby-boy begins.This film is like a children's show-box of dreamlike originality. The visuals, recognizably Anderson's, are stunning. The characters move like little paper-figures through the story, sometimes dancing the line of absurdity and reality. The pink of the hotel matches the story: it is a sweet, fun and interesting ride. It has got humor, it has got originality, it has got the mystery – it has got everything to write a good review about. The sweetness of the story and the visuals, together with the nostalgic flavor on top, makes a delightful surprise.Ralph Fiennes is radiant as the eccentric Gustave H. The actor takes his character very seriously, tough you see that he has fun playing such an absurd figure. His voices matches the concierge perfectly: he loves big words and quickly spoken sentences – this, of course, makes for some unforgettable one-liners. For example, at one point in the film, Gustave H. is in prison and Zero pays him a visit. Former employer and employee sit across of each other, one with a black eye and one in his colorful working attire. When the lobby-asks the concierge what happened, he says:""What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living sh*t out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinksi. You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning. He's actually become a dear friend.""It is unbelievable, but this one line pretty much sums up The Grand Budapest Hotel. For 99 minutes, Gustave H. speaks absurdities like the one above, runs Zero across Europe to save his concierge and in the meantime, Saoirse Ronans character bakes some pastries. The consistency of the film, together with the sudden bits of shock, keeps you on your toes. Just when you get used to the colorful sets, the brilliant characters and the comic soundtrack, you are yet surprised by fingers being chopped of by a door (closed by Willem Defoe, that is) or a decapitated head (not Saoirse Ronans head, that is).You might find yourself wondering whether there was nothing ""wrong"" with The Grand Budapest Hotel. I will tell you, the only thing I disliked about this film, was that it is only 99 minutes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2014,,"I am going to need to use letters to describe specifically offensive words which Hollywood seems bent on using which IMDb police wont allow in their review even though I am making a very specific just point. You'd think we were in grade school. Why is it that Hollywood feels like its still okay to use the other ""F"" word (derogatory name for a homosexual)and steers clear of all the other slurs? ""F"" is still the one socially accepted slur. We all heard it in Wolf Of Wall Street along with plenty of other offense and violence directed at the only gay character. In that one Scorsese made the actual choice of having the characters use the ""other F"" word quite a few times but when it came to a character using the ""N"" word, he actually referred to it as ""N"" word. Why one and not the other. If you are going to be politically correct then you need to do so across the border.And now Wes Anderson...You'd accept more from a ""hipster"". I thought they were supposed to be liberal. Oh the hypocrisy. The audience would not have stood for the ""N"" word being used as it did because they are ""just"" and ""socially conscious"" yet they rolled around and laughed at the other F"" word. Oh the hypocritical fools. All hipster of them. Ignorant fools."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest hotel is a surreal comedy but in a way that pushes you to think of the old Greek comedies, where tragedy becomes edible because it is wrapped in comedy.I am giving this amazing movie a 9, not a 10, for the simple reason that I did not like the prologue and I am not at all a fan of Willem Dafoe. He kills films for me. Maybe it is great acting because he is in both appearance and behavior so unappealing, I find it hard to watch. But then it is unfortunately acting, I would rather be without.But when that is said, this is more than a movie. It is sublime art. The likes of Van Gogh, Gaultier and Wagner. It is obscure and crude but it enraptures you beyond belief. I laughed so much during the film, but strangely the afterthought of it is not laughter and fun. Anyone who has read ""The emperor of lies"" by Steve Sem-Sandberg will be moved by the deeper themes of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Again like the Greek comedies, heavy subjects seem to be well served to the mind through comedy. But, this review would serve anyone poorly if I did not mention the bearing pillars of it all. A sublime Ralph Fiennes finally working with a director who understands to cater to his excessive ability. I will not demean Fiennes by calling it talent. It is more. And Wes Anderson somehow manages to play to him in a way that lets us all enjoy the full repertoire of his abilities. Do not cheat yourself of this incredible performance. Fiennes is always a great actor, bringing craft and devotion to his movies but in this movie he gives us more. Almost climbing to the same heights is Adrien Brody, who I was thrilled to see as ""the bad guy"". An unfamiliar role for him but wonderfully played. And Tony Revolori. Cudos for being such an impressive sidekick. Walking with giants is not easy but he held his own.I know that Wes Anderson is renowned for his cinematography, the techniques of art nouveau film making and for being, well, obscure. But to me his true talent, his gift, is everything that you do not see. The sub-story that lingers after the laughter fades. The surefooted way he lets his actors unfold every little tingle of hidden ability. The way he eases the viewer through some very unpleasant and provocative issues by knowing exactly how far he can push you and never stooping to the temptation to overdo it. And somehow the big colorful ""do"" that he wraps his film in serves to help you digest a fan of difficult issues that would otherwise be inedible.Promise yourself to see this movie whichever way you can. It is well worth it. I will be watching it again. And again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 January 2015,8/10,"For me, I never know what i'm going to think after a Wes Anderson movie and he still kept me guessing after watching previews for this movie. The directing is great, the sets are spectacular and the cast truly makes this movie a hit for me. I love the humor between the characters in all different types of situations and the familiar faces you see in the movie are great, even if they only say a line or two. There's not much to say about the movie as a whole other than that it's just a nice story and for me, not much drag either since it's not that long of a movie. Again, a great cast makes the acting very smooth and there's depth to everyone. For me I can't wait to see what Anderson will do next."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,9/10,"This movie is destined to become a cult classic. Viewers will either love the story, humor, and look of this film or they will hate it. I'm not sure how many will be in each camp, but the folks in the love camp will surely watch this movie over and over again. There is something about the pacing, the use of language, and that trademark Wes Anderson look that renders a fresh and completely new experience. Even the use of profanity is done in a way which endears more than offends. I have always admired Anderson's work, but this film represents the absolute best of one of the most interesting and original directors out there. Lastly, the cast is perhaps one of the best ever assembled. It looks like they had an awful lot of fun making this movie. Highly Recommend."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 July 2014,2/10,"I think some moviegoers wrote positive reviews of this horrid picture just to show they belong to some intellectual elite, which they do not. (Written by graduate of a ""name"" law school, with an M.A. and Ph.D. in political science, not to brag, just to show I am not particularly dumb.)I lost so much interest in this boring debacle that I almost walked out--I have, literally, never come close to doing that with any movie before, and I see at least 10 or so a month.In the hands of a Woody Allen, it might have been tolerable, but not so here.I am glad it was a box office no-show,despite its appealing name. Thank God some people apparently spread the word of how bad it truly is."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 March 2014,7/10,"I'm not sure whether the plot really matters in any Wes Anderson picture. It's worth the admission fee just to view the amazing setting. Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave H., I wasn't convinced that he could pull off a comedic performance but he manages it with aplomb. He is assisted by Tony Revolori as lobby boy Zero Moustafa. There are fleeting cameos from, most notably, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel & Willem Dafoe. Dafoe was doing an impressive impersonation of Christopher Walken's headless horseman from 'Sleepy Hollow'. I enjoyed the movie, there were some humorous situations created by Fiennes & Revolori but all in all I would describe this as more quirky that funny."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 January 2017,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel. I didn't know what I would expect when I saw the trailer for the first time. Wes Anderson, the director of this movie, has done such a brilliant job creating this masterpiece. Every scene seemed to be perfect and well-thought according to my aspect, Robert Yeoman (cinematographer) is very clever for creating scenes with aesthetically pleasing colors and angles to attract the person watching, the vibe of the movie is what made me most excited to watch it. The plot is fun, exciting, and funny. Not a movie that you'd find yourself yawning half-way. Zero (Tony Revolori) is the new lobby boy that finds himself on an unusual adventure with M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) his manager."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,10/10,"My heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's Europe this afternoon, and without jet lag. This movie is an inspiration, a dream, a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. Ralph Fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic. The later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an amazing adventure with James Bond style chases, a large murder mystery, the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography. The sets, models, angles and even the most nondescript characters come to life each on their own and together as a symphony of beauty. It's freaking brilliant; The Grand Budapest Hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 June 2020,1/10,"Pointless and not funny. I did not enjoy it at all, not even for a minute!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 October 2017,10/10,"Wes Anderson is not for everyone. At this point, his films are an acquired taste, and there's enough of a body of work for people to make up their minds whether they like the brand of hand-made, exquisitely carved life-sized doll houses he's selling (if you told me a major director was also a serial killer, my first guess would be Wes Anderson). I happen to be an avid Anderson fan, but I don't argue with people who aren't. His bouts of whimsy are prone to self- indulgence, and his austere emotionalism can be hard to connect with. He's a tremendous filmmaker but he isn't invincible—The Life Aquatic is self-indulgent, The Darjeeling Limited is just plain bad. Still, Wes Anderson on his worst day is better than 98% of working directors on their best.The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson working on a very, very good day."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 September 2021,9/10,"Well written, directed and acted. World-class production design."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 February 2018,9/10,This is a movie I enjoyed with everything. The great actors and their performances were just amazing. I liked story very much and also how it was filmed. It's just one of the great movie that you must watch.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 November 2020,10/10,"I've never seen a film quite like this one. Really pulls you into the magic of this complex, incredible world. Thank you, Wes Anderson."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 May 2018,10/10,"My time spent reviewing the film here will be brief as it would be pointless to describe how much I love this film here. Great cinematography, score, acting, and of course directing. The mood is such a warm and friendly place to be, fitting that it should be named after a grand hotel. Love the use of aspect ratio. Every character is utilized to perfection and never overstays their welcome, leaving you completely satisfied in their conclusion. A great film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 July 2014,9/10,"Grand Budapest Hotel is a visually stunning film by Wes Anderson. It's the story of a hotel concierge and his loyal lobby boy and their misadventures revolving around an antique painting. You will be taken on a hysterical romp through the European countryside as the story unfolds. Grand Budapest is a fun, quirky film that will have its watchers rooting for the main characters while being astounded by the visual beauty of each scene. All the actors are amazing in this film with Ralph Fiennes in the title role of Gustav H. Look for some famous faces throughout the film to make cameos. I give the film 9 out of 10 stars as this film is on par with other great films such as ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" and ""Topsy Turvy."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2021,8/10,"The single most symmetrical movie you will see. Every single shot throughout the movie has been thought of to the fullest, and it really shows."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 August 2021,8/10,"What a blast this film was to watch. Anderson's routine use of symmetry could not be more enjoyable and essential to this particular film. The color palette, script and incredible cast make this a must-see on a big, saturated screen!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 July 2020,8/10,"This is such a nice movie. Almost a weird fairytale. Everything is so dreamy and princessy. Such a feel good movie. I laughed a lot and it as fun to watch. Great, cinematography, production design and performances. Congrats to everyone involved."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 November 2014,8/10,"It was a wonderful narrative of a very simple story. All credits goes to Wes Anderson. The way he imagined the set for the movie is really excellent. The visual of the movie was excellent. He created a different world with his characters. He made own sets of laws for the movie in his created world. The quality of acting was extremely high as we can find big names for such small roles. The movie was like 90-95 minutes of continuous story telling. However there has been lots of violence in the movie, the way of showing was kind of a beautiful. You won't have the feeling that someone just got killed. Ralph Fiennes is just superb as the fast-talking persnickety M. Gustave H., concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, in 1930's Europe. He will become the mentor of the new Lobby Boy at the hotel, Zero Moustafa. Zero is portrayed wonderfully as well by Tony Revolori, making his big screen starring role debut. Much of the story here will revolve around their adventures together in and out of the hotel environs. If I am not very wrong Ralph Fiennes may get a Oscar Nomination for the leading role and The Grand Budapest Hotel will get Best Picture Nomination. I didn't mind the bittersweet ending about M. Gustave, because the movie invested more into that character than Agatha, but it seem wrong, not to show, what happen to them. It seem a lot of the plot conclusion was unfinished. After all, the movie never truly tells how M. Gustave prove his innocent, or who killed him. The film was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. The film has bits from 1939 novel 'Beware of Pity' and 1982 'The Post Office Girl"". You see that in Anderson's films, that he truly love art. Indeed, it's an art-film about loving art. His films are full of His films are full of charmingly obscure references to old music, theater, literature, paintings and photography. The locations that they use are beautiful. I love the nostalgia look of the clothes, you really get the time period. I also didn't mind the use of handmade miniature models. It was funny to see it, but fits in with the mood of the story, so well. The Deadpan comedy works so well, in this movie. I wouldn't stop, laughing. The silly dialogue is delivered in such a serious way that makes it fun to watch. I'm a sucker for smart comedies. I didn't like the lack of European accents. It was alright. The movie does have some harsh language, but unlike other modern comedies. It's works with the story, because it used to expression deep emotion depth, than a misplace adjective. The violence can be a bit too violent at times. This might be Anderson's darkest, most violent film yet. I really think some people might hate what happen to a certain cat in the film. The movie did a few scenes of nudity that could had been cut. It wasn't need. Overall: The movie takes the cake. In this case, Mendl's Courtesan au Chocolats. It's a good well-made movie with some faults.Viewers have the freedom to think whether or not it has a gaudy or a conservative ending. Weis Anderson created a fictional story in a fictional setting which is very easy to love and hard to let go once the credits roll.Enough about Fiennes fantastic performance; there's loads more I loved about this movie. The cast is loaded to the breaking point with talent and everyone delivers. The advertising prints for the film are half cast list, promoting the more than a dozen talents starring in the film. Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton the list goes on with special mention to Willem Dafoe as Dmitri's hard-boiled, silent henchman. It's also nice to see Jeff Goldblum on screen again, even if it's just a minor role as the hotel's lawyer. The impressive cast is fine match for the film's even more engaging visual style. I don't remember much of Anderson's other films but I hope THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a nice indication of what I can expect to see. The film's colors pop vibrantly. The whole world of the Grand Budapest (in the 30s) is a pastel wonderland of pinks, purples, and reds. And I loved that the camera never stopped moving. Every frame has a frantic vibe, if not for the character's erratic natures then the constant camera movement. I really can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. The story was fun, the characters were quirky, the film looked beautiful, and it's got an amazing cast. I'm not sure how general audiences would respond to a film so strange but it's won me over as a potential fan of Wes Anderson."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2015,7/10,"The movie gives that feeling... you watch it and feel something like pain of looking at dirty truth although you would probably prefer to look at something more pleasant even if it were a sweetest lie. But you do not have such an opportunity. You just see the absurd and you understand that it is a film, it is an absurd, all is like pictured on canvas with pencil and paints. They use a pink filter for shooting (I can recall only one else use of pink filter, in 'La môme'), they show stupid gags and heroes are funny - to intensify contrast between beautiful pictures, nice heroes and ugly situation. And you want to cry of all you see. It is painful... Maybe, it is an effect after all our XX century history, who knows. If you could rewrite it you would do it. But all choice you have, like a personage of Jude Law has, is to live with it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,5/10,"If you go to see Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, or Tom Wilkinson then you'll be disappointed. Their parts are something less than cameos and really don't give them an opportunity to do their thing.What was great about The Life Aquatic was its spoof of Jacques Cousteau and his milieu, something specific and real to bounce the comedy off of. The Grand Budapest Hotel has no real-world anchor and thus it's just a silly farcical story. The self-important concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) takes himself, his position, and his hotel way too seriously. How much funnier it would have been had there been some real-world character to set Gustave against.The film is set ambiguously in 1930s Europe, even the Nazi thugs are ambiguous; their SS insignia looks like the scribble of a lazy physics professor. The special effects are period too. There's a chase scene on skis and sled that is ridiculously low-tech. How much funnier it would have been if there was something real world to measure it against like Cousteau's 1970s seat-of-the-pants, do-it-yourself science in the hands of Bill Murray.Then there is the fictional bakery, Mendl's, whose cakes and confections try to be funny, but suffer from the same lack of a real-world counterpoint. It just doesn't carry the comic weight of Bill Murray's ship the Belafonte in Life Aquatic because there is no Calypso to measure it against. For those of you who don't know, Calypso was Cousteau's real-world research vessel. The comic jolt comes when you realize that Harry Belafonte was a famous calypso singer back then. It's brilliant little details like that, that made me roar at Life Aquatic but that are sorely lacking in Budapest."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has inspiring dialogs of refined language. A movie that trusts its viewer, it shows no fear of oblivion and omission. It is not a historical movie, although it uses a historical setting. In its pictorial beauty and its subtle humor, always keeping a distance to the narrated, it can be described of what is a movie with the poignancy of ""The Fall"" combined the irony of Woody Allen.The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a movie of dull ambiance, but it is also far from being tacky. It has some elements of Sherlock Holmes, or closer to Woody Allen, ""Scoop"", it is romantic, ironic, and driven by its characters and the magnificently narrated story. Typical elements of an romantic piece of art, it is also reflecting on art itself. It deals with the consequences of the Nazi invasion, but purposely not in a historical flavor. The insignia of the ""SS"" is replaced by ""ZZ"". This is a story of Gustave and Zero. The girlfriend of young lobby boy Zero, Agatha, is much more of a symbol for Zeros progress in poetry and arts than a character.If there had been bears and prostitutes, I would have suspected John Irving as the writer of the script: A story of a boy growing up with his Idol, being separated for a while only to reunite later. Love affairs with older women and boyish adventures. Elements we know well from Irving. But more importantly the movie shares his passion for details in a passionately narrated story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,8/10,"In a somewhat rare turn for an Anderson script, this one actually has a plot! Essentially it's the tale of a hotel in the Republic of Zubrowka, a fictional central-European country that has mountain views, funicular transportation, and a candy-pink hotel that's propped up on one of the local peaks.With a story that spans several decades, the bulk of the narrative takes place during the hotel's heyday, just as the tide of the Second World War is crashing on the borders of Zubrowka.The story is one of art thievery, providing gigolo services to octogenarians, and the importance of good manners and good service as aspects of one's conduct."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 April 2014,10/10,"Generally I can uncover or decipher a main argument a director is attempting to make with his or her film. For Wes Anderson, however, I have had a difficulty trying to uncover exactly what he is trying to say. Sure he makes jabs at the falsivity of commercial filmmaking, he pushes the bounds of good taste by humorizing sometimes heavy subject matter, but I wouldn't say that's what his films are about per se. In the case of The. Grand Budapest Hotel... It follows a similar structure to other Wes Anderson films, the cinematography is fantastic (hard to believe not Oscar winning) the acting is spot on (though acting in Anderson's films is probably not the most difficult though still well executed) and the editing is well done. Perhaps what Anderson is getting at here is that his films are like paintings and that he is the painter. The composition of each of his shots is meticulous and deliberate, much like a painting. The framing of the film is also generally stable with little camera movement. These elements make for films unlike any other, and it is quite refreshing and enjoyable. I would reccome do anyone see this film (age appropriate of course, there is some shocking violence) and I myself will more than likely see it again.I very much enjoyed my stay at the Grand Budapest."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 July 2014,6/10,"Were you expecting comedy? Well, the movie ain't that much funny, there are some truly comic parts, and some scenes that make you smile (e.g. the part when Mr. Gustave delivers the meal to the inmate with scar on his face), but not so much of a comedy in general.Were you expecting drama? Forget about it. The character development is weird - *spoiler*: Mr. Gustave seems like well-organized man with sense for reality and rather smart, yet we are witnesses to a stupid dialogue when he escapes the jail and all he cares about is his cologne. Also, there are several details that make the drama fall apart, like a taxi in 30s with modern TAXI sing. Moments like that, you forget about the drama and ask yourself - what the heck? Why?Were you expecting action movie / thriller? Nope. Some people die, we can also see some ""action"", but the scenes only add more weirdness (downhill ski chase shot in double speed from upside with totally fake terrain - it's like some PC sport game from the end of 90's).And when you start thinking, the movie is finally moving somewhere, it ends.Even 30 minutes after the end, I still had that ""What????"" feeling."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2015,8/10,"Wes Andersons dark artistic comedy; now, any individual would notice that the genre on left hand side is contradictory to each other. How a comedy can be artistic? Whilst I did not laugh, nor smile, at this eccentric, yet intriguing tale: of the owner of a damned establishment of European Grand Budapest Hotel and his immigrant lobby boy, as they embark on a tale featuring a stolen painting and a desired will; I throughly enjoyed this amusedly odd spectacle. Filled with vibrating colors, great architecture and the set that surely was amusedly atrocious to set out- kudos to the winners of award, you deserve it here- the lead co-act was top notch, a cheery on the cupcake. Every frame is a painting. While other directors do movies, Anderson does motion pictures."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 December 2019,8/10,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a great film and narrative work. It has an excellent script but sometimes sins of pride. A very innovative and fresh narrative; and with an anti-war concept - with a harsh criticism of greed and greed - very well executed in order to be grandiloquent, achieving it clearly. Very good performances, taking the film clearly Ralph. Sublime address. Good soundtrack Good sound. As for its genre, I must emphasize something that seems essential to me: it has been cataloged to the film as a comedy ... but, it does not seem like a comedy, since although it wants to imitate and honor the film branch which Chaplin potentiated , it seems to me that it does not reach that level of comic range; Now, however, this work manages to generate a non-unique, but rare style: a surrealistically detective style, which catches during the hour and a half of the film.
In conclusion: it seems to me an excellent film, which more than achieves what is proposed, without stumbling at any time during its path."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 February 2015,10/10,"Just a note, this isn't exactly full of spoilers, but I put that spoiler warning because it may confuse readers who haven't seen the movie.Not only one of my favorites of 2014, but quite possibly one of my favorite films of all time. It is pretty much my favorite screenplay of all time. The way Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness precisely craft a story so inherently beautiful just blows me away.There are many facets of this movie to enjoy. Firstly, it is a comedy, and this is quite a prevalent and enjoyable aspect of the film. It's not normal comedy, however. Somehow, Anderson is able to write scenes that he knows will be funny. They don't seem to be comedic on the page, but in his direction, in the exceptional performances he gets out of his actors, he builds it, effortlessly, it seems. But The Grand Budapest Hotel stands tall and mighty because of its melancholy, buried somewhere in its aesthetic. It is a beautiful story. I had to watch it about three times and read the screenplay to fully grasp the raw poignancy of the screenplay, a longing for a better time. Watch the film again, and you might discover the tragic exterior surrounding the laughs. It is absolutely beautiful. Another level of this movie is the high-class veneer of the story, but when you think about it, you realize how lowbrow and brutish the plot really is. That doesn't make it any less brilliant, though.The film would just be a really good movie with an outstanding screenplay at this point. But three factors push it to transcend expectations. Firstly, the cast of characters. Anderson and Guinness write interesting characters like Tony Bennett can croon: effortlessly. Such a wonderful set of characters, each more interesting and intriguing than the last. This is further enriched by the solid cast, with great performances all around. I can't say who was best, but Ralph Fiennes, in the lead role, certainly makes the best of his character. The cast is masterful, a group of artists who collaborate to unfurl fascinating tapestries. Additionally, there is the technical feel of the film. Every shot, every intent breathed onto the screen is exposed by the intricacy and complex intertwining of cinematography and production design. Every single shot is particular. Every single blemish on an actor's face? Intentional. Who can forget the beautiful exterior shots of the environments, of the hotel itself? It is truly masterwork.Finally, the movie is pushed into a whole new level, and creates a completely fascinating and enrapturing world with one final jigsaw piece: Alexandre Desplat's score. Desplat has previously scored The King's Speech, Argo, and many other films. But he has, in fact, nobody really has ever made anything like this. His score creates an entirely new environment. NPR did a story on the score, and it is fascinating. They hit the nail on the head. It discusses how the score is playful and whimsical, and perfectly matches the tone of the film, while also maintaining suspense and carrying the story. Also interesting are the character themes, like Moustafa's and especially Jopling's. Jopling's character plays on screen with a simple, playful, yet overtly tense theme which conveys exactly who his character is precisely.The movie is thrilling during the viewing, but also captivating in its analysis. How does one analyze such a simple movie like The Grand Budapest Hotel? I read an article which explained why the film was so powerful because of allusions to the Holocaust. At this point I stopped reading the article because I felt it was pure bologna. However, I thought about it. I re-read the screenplay with a new frame of mind, and it makes perfect sense. But it was a different logic, a different conclusion. Why was it logical in multiple senses? The fact is, The Grand Budapest Hotel appears to be a simple movie, but it unfolds into the greatest complexity of all: it is a people's film. The movie may not make sense, so it implores you to ponder about it. It encourages you to understand it in your own way. The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favorite movie of 2014. I highly recommend you watch it, the film has something for everybody."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 October 2020,10/10,"Ralph Fiennes wasn't on the list of nominees for Best Actor for the SAG Awards and I therefore couldn't vote for him. At the time my party and I had just screened another nominee movie that sucked the soul out of our bodies. We finally shut it off and tried The Grand Budapest Hotel. It was like opening a large hardcover beautifully illustrated picture story book and jumping into that world. Ralph Fiennes was unrecognizable as M. Gustave. His mannerisms, inflections, and stylized acting carried this movie and this wonderfully witty movie, a breath of fresh air, revived our souls and through to the end, we were elated."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 January 2020,8/10,"Not much to say, delicious and brilliant humor in a Chinese box weave punctuated by frenetic and pressing rhythms. Anderson's almost vignetting work does not want to convey a precise message but delights the viewer with a direction and a script worthy of note. A refined comedy, in full Wes style."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 January 2018,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is quaint, both story-wise and visually. Characters are memorable and charming, even the antagonists.It's a Wes Anderson film through and through, and one of the most endearing films I've ever seen."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 May 2015,3/10,"What happens when Max Fischer graduates from Rushmore and goes to Hollywood? He reads Stephan Zweig and makes a totally pretentious 'art-house' movie 'inspired' by a cursory reading of a few of Zweig's minor novellas. In his own imagination Max Fischer is a great director/playwright (and also master of calculus) but in the real world he is an industrious but dim-witted student whose grades are so low he fails to graduate from high-school. On a subject which he knows something about, which is documenting the torment of his daily life at Westchester High or describing the interactions of the members of his very odd family the level of writing/directing is what one might say juvenile (that is written by a juvenile, and in this case for a juvenile audience) but decent. Now, the young Mr Fischer with a few movies under his belt may well imagine (as he is prone to) that he is the next Dostoyevsky, but that does not make it so. Just as he might imagine himself to be the next Einstein of mathematics when in the real world his endeavours are failed by his 11'th grade math teacher, this work is equally woeful in respect of literature. The really sad thing is that some really quite good actors have fallen for this claptrap, as have almost all professional movie critics.So what is it about this movie that flags up amateur night most prominently? It is probably the name of the fictional country in which the film is set: the republic of 'Zubrowka'. Which is the trade name of a polish vodka, previously banned from the American market due to a toxic grass extract but which was reformulated specifically for the American market in 2011, and promoted with an equally pretentious 'art-house' advertising campaign. Can you imagine an author like Zweig or Dostoyevsky being so taken by a 30 second vodka spot that they turn it into a novel or play? And these are not Ridley Scott mid-80s European type advertisements (which have some small modicum of artistic merit), but much more run of the mill adverts for the American market (where shouting about a 'monster truck rally' is considered normal fare). At the 'monster' truck rally young Max might have seen an advert for 'my brother is facing the electric chair for a crime he didn't commit ... after his appeals were exhausted we knew there was only one way to get him out ... blam! blam! blam! ... Prison Break! Thursdays 8:30 (9:30 mountain), only on Fox!!'.Yes dear reader, when the vodka runs out (which takes about 10 minutes) we move straight on to Prison Break. Once the protagonist has broken out of prison (which is very long and tedious, taking about half the movie) we move on to a pursuit by 'Jaws', of the Bond variety. And then it's fair to say it only goes downhill from there.Now if Wes/Max had stuck with the pretentious pseudo-arty vodka advertisement then the resulting short film would probably have been OK, rescued perhaps by Ralph Fiennes performance. Set design is quite nice but very 'stagey'. It's a bit like one of the plays-within-the-film that Max puts on in Rushmore, which we are led to believe are fairly pedestrian but have amazingly intricate sets. What is missing is the real movie outside of this play within a movie.For Max's next movie I would suggest a film about a very 'artsy' and pretentious Hollywood writer/director who leads a very dull drab life, is picked on by his peers and is forced to make very stupid movies about monster trucks ... which despite the prosaic subject matter are amazingly intricate and detailed (like transformers as animated by ILM) ... of which we get to see interesting fragments to punctuate an otherwise dull drab cruel world."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 December 2018,9/10,"It's a fantastic Wes Anderson film.
Definitely stands up after repeate watches.
Fiennes is spectacular, so is everyone else for that matter.
The cast includes one of my top 5 most hated actresses/actors and wes made them look good.
Not much else to say except watch it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 May 2021,10/10,I was captured by the unique style and surprised how good the film was. Now it's one of my favorite movies.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 December 2019,10/10,"Another fantastic Anderson film. Other than the obvious/expected Anderson style that we all know and love, The Grand Budapest Hotel showcases some great writing and execution.The characters were well written and enjoyable to watch. Personally, I found the beginning slightly confusing and at first wasn't really sure who was the narrator until later on in the film. The character/relationship development wasn't forced and felt natural following the plot.This films story line is what I think was the most stand out about it. Sometimes a selective few of Anderson films can seem to slightly blur together in my mind but I think The Grand Budapest Hotel did a good job of being unique and different in terms of the story. (Moonrise Kingdom is another film that does this really well)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 May 2020,9/10,OMGGGG! ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN 2014! YOU CAN FIND COMEDY AND VIOLENCE AND AMAZING ACTING WITH AN INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT OF THE CAMERA AND A COLORFUL PICTURE
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 November 2020,10/10,"As we see this Wes Anderson's masterpiece, we become fond of it's characters and cinematography, the movie is filled with Anderson's trade marks that we love and can't get enough. The two main characters played by Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori have an amazing chemistry, even though Tony isn't a very experienced actor he can keep up with Ralph for the entire picture, I guess people just need an opportunity to prove themselves great, and he did it.
The thing that I found most enjoyable in this light comedy, was that instead of having those ""movie feels"", I felt like I was at the theater watching a 3 act play, and it was an amazing experience for me!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 December 2014,4/10,"The acting is good and the story is okay but I'm not a big fan of this movie. Everything is laid out too precisely; everything is made to fit. All the details are handed to the viewer; it's too easy. I never felt I had to think about anything. Some people may like that but I don't.I enjoy movies that challenge me; that engage my mind in some way. To understand, follow, and appreciate them, the viewer has to think. I didn't get that with this movie. I also couldn't relate to any of the characters; they felt flat and one-dimensional. As a result, I didn't feel invested. I simply did not care about them or their outcomes.Really, I'm not trying to bash the movie. I just felt it was too basic, too simplistic for my taste. This stripped down style of storytelling seems to be used often by Wes Anderson. I hadn't realized it but I've seen quite a few of his films. I don't remember them all but the most recent I've seen, Moonrise Kingdom and Darjeeling Limited, have a very similar feel as TGBH. In fact, that's how I realized they were related."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2014,10/10,"From the first few minutes of the film, Wes Anderson keeps us guessing.Just as we begin to wrap our heads around one scene, this layer is immediately peeled back to reveal another equally perplexing one. The story in a nutshell centres around M. Gustave, a renowned concierge who prides himself on his impeccable service, and his unlikely friendship with Zero Moustafa, a bell boy at the establishment, as they try to reclaim what was rightfully theirs with the help of a mish mash of random characters and Agatha and her sweet delicious cakes from Mendl's.Anderson's characteristically symmetric framing and set-up of each shot works seamlessly with his somewhat abrupt style of storytelling. We as the viewer feel like we've been plucked from our own realities and dropped into the much more fascinating private lives of the characters of the film. At times it may even make us feel like unwanted intruders as we learn more about these people through watching their day-to-day interactions than we would from an omniscient narrator voiced by Morgan Freeman (no offence Morgan Freeman if you're reading this, your voice is awesome).In true Wes Anderson fashion, the cast list reads as a 'Who's who of actors who are, like, famous and stuff'. But this almost ridiculous sounding ensemble works because there are just too many of them and too little time for us as the audience to choose a favourite. The characters are also just quirky enough that you forget about Ralph Fiennes as that Garderner who was Constant, Adrien Brody as the Pianist or Owen Wilson as that guy with the annoying voice- oh waitThis film really felt a lot more tightly packed than Anderson's previous film Moonrise Kingdom. The plot is complex without being too hard to follow, with just the right dash of ridiculousness for the audience to be chuckling throughout the movie. Whereas Moonrise Kingdom relied more heavily on the use of children as the main characters and the humour that arose from that, much of the comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel comes from the fast-paced and witty dialogue – especially from M. Gustave (Fiennes), the concierge you can't help but love (especially if you're a blonde octogenarian of the female persuasion).While it is no secret that I adore Wes Anderson (see previous Moonrise Kingdom review), I have to say that his latest film has actually exceeded my expectations. Finding fault with his films is something I always struggle with and the reason is that his work is just so different and incomparable to anything else out there that it can only be considered an artwork rather than a movie. And just like the painting, 'Boy with Apple', which many of the film's events are centred around, it can only be appreciated in its totality, with its strengths and imperfections – worms and all.IMDb: 8.4/10Rotten Tomatoes: 92%(From projectreel: http://projectreel.wordpress.com)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 March 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel follows a wonderful concierge (Ralph Fiennes) and his loyal lobby boy (Tony Revolori) as they get involved in a ridiculous adventure.This is in my opinion one of Wes Anderson's most beautiful films. It has a unique style. The acting is great all around. Ralph Fiennes is spectacular as Gustave. He's charming, funny, and dignified. One of the best performances of the year. My only complaint is that the great supporting cast doesn't get enough screen time because the movie moves along at a very brisk pace. If you aren't a Wes Anderson fan, this movie probably won't turn you into one but I consider The Grand Budapest Hotel to be one of his best films. Rating: 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 July 2014,10/10,"Ah,Wes. You never cease to amaze me. This is one in a row of many that came before it. I feel like this could only be called a ''little brother'' of a movie,strange as it may sound. In retrospect,I can see myself watching it with a hot cup of tea (or coffee),on a rainy day,wearing a big woolly jumper,all wrapped up in my favorite blanket. Of course,none of the mentioned was actually put into action. None the less,this picture is such a treat. Similar to Agatha's 'Courtesan au Chocolat',it is a beautifully decorated piece of perfection,hiding a chocolate surprise on the inside,and packed in a pretty pink box with a signature blue ribbon. A few things come to mind with such a grand slice of cinematography; the guests(ranging from somewhat sane to completely cuckoo),Mr. Gustave's polished black shoes,and of course - pink. Pastel pink everywhere. I also take a liking to the hints of awkwardness that arise,as well as the tension in the air between the characters,so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. Or perhaps,the 'Throat Slitter'... It is clear,from the very beginning of the movie,that everything had to be done perfectly,or the magic of this divine hotel would be lost. A tiny slip up is all it would take for us to lose the smile that'd been lingering on our faces through the whole film. I can say,with out a doubt,much like the painting 'Boy with Apple',this quirky movie is a masterpiece!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2014,9/10,"The thing about this movie is that you can watch it without being critical about it. It puts you in a mood of comfort where you just enjoy it and not worry that you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this film. From the start (hell! from the trailers), you know you're gonna love this movie. ---simply put, a very likable film. The story drags you deeper into the intricate and unpredictable plot. The humor is there tinged and spiced by the characters' realistic view of life. The innocent Zero interwoven with the precise and darkly humorous Monsieur Gustave creates a mischievously adorable friendship. Anderson (as what i can see from behind-the-scene videos) has complete control of the set, the casts and the story. The script writing is dark in its ways but also really fits the casts. (no wonder big time actors signed up for the roles). Viewers have the freedom to think whether or not it has a gaudy or a conservative ending. Weis Anderson created a fictional story in a fictional setting which is very easy to love and hard to let go once the credits roll."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 May 2015,10/10,"If the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel existed I would enter it immediately, the film that has been created is a visual and character triumph. There are very few films that have been created which convey the precise image that the director had intended, down to the last detail, but the Grand Budapest is one of them. The colour schemes that are used to contrast the mood and the emotion for each scene are impressive enough, but the highly orchestrated set design and props allows for a single shot of a character to reveal their entire personality. From the bright flamboyancy of Gustave H to the dark mysterious persona of Jopling, we see true characters being developed, ones we find ourselves involved in and rooting for. While some may only watch this film, I feel the only way to truly experience it is to analyse. For example, why does Moustafa keep the hotel? Is it the building itself, is it the nostalgia or is it the last remnants of the idea good will and kindness of man creates greatness, not money or greed only by watching can you find out and draw your own conclusion. The world is immersive, the characters are deep and full of personality. The story is truly an amazing achievement. This film is what cinema was made for, I cannot praise it enough."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 March 2014,5/10,"I came to the cinema like a client promised the most wonderful menu at a 3 star Michelin restaurant.It was truly an absolutely visual feast but alas as much as I pushed the offering around my plate I found nothing by the time the credits rolled..From the opening establishing shot of the impossibly located Grand Hotel Budapest to the self indulgent and utterly pointless dialogue I had to wonder how on earth did wonderful artists become involved in the folly of The Grand Hotel.. What on earth were they doing in this self indulgent piece of nonsense.Anna Pinnock as the Set Decorator as usual came to the plate and did the most incredible work but I felt like a duck being prepared for the Pate menu... Sorry Mr Anderson and all those reviewers who have been taken in by the Emperors' new clothes... Such a waste of great talents from artists to designers etc..etc..I can only add that like all great artists there has to be a detractor or two and I do not consider this man to be a great artist just overly self indulgent... Imagination ,invention, does not a genius make.If I had felt in need of visual stimulation there are endless museums and galleries I can visit beginning with Tate Modern. What a waste of 90 minutes or so .It felt like a lifetime ...What a waste of the considerable budget!!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 July 2014,10/10,"""Take your hands off my Lobby Boy.""This is outrageously brilliantly funny. A wonderful modern-day classic. An instant gem of this year of 2014. A perfect film of hilarity, laugh out loud comical banter and acting mastery. You the viewer are sent on a trippy world that only Wes Anderson can make up. The costumes, the sets, scenery are all flawless and truly is the Wes Anderson's persona of making films. He has away with telling the story, directing and getting his characters in the flawless brilliant, funny scenarios that will leave the viewer with a lasting impression of his ultimate, original brilliance.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an instant classic. An instant favorite of mine. It is a must see, must praise and as of now, this brilliant film is added to my all-time favorite movies. Adding it to my all-time favorites is a reality that does not happen much. Few films are added to my 1000 movies you should see before you die. I feel this is a film that is magical and truly a gifted weirdness that grabs the viewer in all its twisted comical realities and takes them on an unforgettable funny, dorky, silly wonderful journey of pure originality and perfection.The cast alone is absolutely extraordinary. There are more actors in this film then can be believed. The actors and there characters create an unbelievable persona and sitting for the viewer. All the acting is brilliant. The stars just shine off screen and are bubbly, hilarious, funny, silly, dorky and absolutely entertaining.Wes Anderson is a genius.The story is wild and brilliantly entertaining. A mix of wild comedy and a coloring book flare. I love the narrative and the ultimate conclusion of perfect comical reality. You never know where Anderson is going and that's the ultimate beauty of his cinema world. The Grand Budapest is a wild story of murder, escaped killers, sex with old people, a lobby boy and deserts and a painting of a boy with an apple.The shining stars are Fiennes and Revolori. Both work off each other in a golden comical way of perfection. Revolori as the Lobby Boy deserves an award for his character of comical banter and flare. Fiennes deserves to be nominated for best actor this year for this wild, over the top beauty of comical mastery. He gave it his all and created a character I will remember the rest of my movie loving life. I love Wes Anderson's creation of characters and the beauty of their persona's and dialogue and the ultimate situations only an original master like Anderson could come up with. I think the golden ticket goes to the surroundings and odd coloring sets and motels and situations where it was filmed. It bleeds nostalgia and retro eye candy. Awesome spots of filming that give all the more reality to the picture.Willem Defoe as the murdering thug is a priceless character. Defoe is a god of acting and he aced this motorcycle, leather wearing, fist rings and mayhem to a memorable and laughable reality on screen. Brody is awesome as the money hungry son and Edward Norton as the law is a magical moment. I have to say this is Anderson's best. I love most all his films but this one truly shines in the odd, original and twisted nature of his cinematic beauty of silliness and over all cast of characters. His creation through, only scenarios he could make up and film as visionary, shines for the watcher.Gustave and his sidekick The Lobby Boy is on the run. Gustave is accused of murdering his elderly lover. He has to figure out the truth through twisted scenarios of adventures and actions that cloud his path of freeing himself. One crazy ordeal after another leads to a wonderful hilarious good time.""Can I interest you in a plate of mush?"" www.abucketofcorn.com"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2014,9/10,"With the release of his eighth feature film, I think it is now safer than ever to say that Wes Anderson has reached a point of cinematic perfection. His most ambitious work yet, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is Anderson's magnum opus. At its core, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the story of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), famed concierge to the Grand Budapest. Anderson wastes no time in alerting the audience that while this is a story about M. Gustave, it is in no means his story. Leaping from the present, to 1985, then abruptly to 1968, and finally resting in 1932 the film is more than your typical frame story; rather a frame story contained within a frame story. So while M. Gustave remains the central figure throughout the bulk of the narrative, the film is equally Zero (Tony Revolori and F. Murray Abraham) and the unnamed author's (Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson) story as well.The film chronicles the unlikely friendship of M. Gustave and Zero, as the two are bonded through the theft of a painting of immeasurable value. In usual Anderson flare, the duo's chronicle is envisioned with whimsical color and framing, tracking cameras, lavish sets, quirky caricatures and stop motion animation. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" exhibits Anderson's vision at its utmost capacity. The real emotional strength of the film lies in the performances. Fiennes' captivating character both pretentious and endearing, Revolori's innocence, and Abraham's subtle charm; the range of emotions contained within the film are almost incalculable. Anderson's attention to detail, matched with the multitude of stars, grants even the smallest of roles the ability to transcend. Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jason Schwartzman and even the brief inclusion of Owen Wilson, deliver some of the grandest moments within the film. Special praise must be given to Dafoe, who has created one of the most horrifying cinematic monsters to appear outside of the horror genre. His character is somewhere between Max Schreck's Nosferatu and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter.While the exceptional performances drive the narrative, it is in Anderson's brave formal experimentations that the film should be highest praised. For many, Anderson's decision to frame the majority of the film in 4:3 ratio (also known as the Academy Ratio) may have seemed arbitrary; even detrimental to the viewing experience. The apparent loss in width does cause a claustrophobic sensation. When further assessed, it becomes clear that the ratios throughout the film change in correspondence to historical accuracy. So we experience the Academy Ratio during the 1932 sequences, Cinemascope (2.35:1) for 1968 and the current industry standard 1.85:1 for the remaining periods. This subliminal instruction of cinematic history may be lost on certain viewers, but it is in Anderson's willingness to defy cinematic conventions for ideological ends that I find ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" to be most engaging. A must-see for cinephiles and Anderson fanatics alike"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,5/10,"First, this is billed as a comedy. At the showing we saw, nobody laughed. At all. Nobody. The only reason I did not rate this lower was that there were a lot of fine actors portraying their roles with skill. Unfortunately, the characters are two-dimensional, the plot is silly at best, and even the cinematography is frequently cartoonish. There were whole scenes that were amateurishly animated. Many lines that I think were supposed to be shocking just came off dumb. Having funny stuff going on in the background can be a great device when used with skill, such as in Police Squad or even Mad Magazine, but then the background stuff has to actually be funny. None of this movie was. I'm sorry I paid money for this film, but even if it had been free I still resent the waste of time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2015,9/10,"This is my first IMDb movie review: From the beginning of the movie and the intro scene, you know you're in for a good show, and this movie was even better than i thought it would be. It was very entertaining, funny and well shot. The movie was so great that it was able to combine between comedy, drama and even some romance and i never wanted it to end! Also the way it was shot was very unique and the characters in it had such a great chemistry. The only thing that i disliked about the movie was the ending. I wanted to see more on how things turned out and what events took place after the story was over and how did things end up the way they are now by showing scenes about it. But this minor complain doesn't effect the movie at all.Overall it was a well told story in a very unique way. DO NOT MISS IT!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 December 2020,9/10,"Movie has Wes Andersen written all over it. The narrative style and pacing make tremendous impacts and its easy to get lost in the story. What it lacks in character development (specifically with the Lutz family) makes up for in visuals and the acting from Ralph Fiennes. Cinematography was great: the wide shots of the men walking through shadows, the Jeff Goldblum/William Devoe chase scene, the hotel shooting scene in the end and countless other examples. The beauty and style really give this movie width and breadth
8.5/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 January 2021,10/10,"A touching movie with well developed characters and a great script played by excellent actors. Very well spiced with drama and humor. Photography, stage and tricks are those of a great movie. The many quotes to the grand old days are perhaps even better understood for someone who grew up in Europe. A wonderful realization of an inspiration by Stephan Zweig."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 July 2015,4/10,"Before I say anything negative about the film, I will admit that the premise is entertaining and had potential, and that it has a fantastic cast. That being said, I couldn't stand watching this movie, which is typical for me when it comes to Wes Anderson. There may be some bias there, but I find this, along with most of his other films, to be desperately trying to catch and keep the viewer's attention with rapidly changing colors, plots, and characters. This greatly detracts from what could have been a very funny movie. It strikes me as something made for the ADHD people of the world, making sure something is constantly distracting the viewer. When you can focus and look past the elaborate sets, you see a very shallow movie with little to offer. Very disappointed with that waste of my time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 March 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is that rare entertainment that comes in a shiny pink candy box decorated with a black ribbon. It sweeps you off your feet and takes you into a journey of surreal and dark comical adventure. The best kind of adventure. It is the story of a master concierge living his life in an almost imperial dream intertwined with a picture of Europe preparing for war. It is a beautiful combination and it highlights a great film direction. Life's little problems(like getting one's deserved part of the heritage) inside life's big problems(like facing the ever increasing oppression of war and surviving a document control in the process) are golden moments of storytelling, of dark humour and finally of the very warmth of a human heart. Anderson's unique universe has excellent production design, cinematography, music and editing. The parade of stars and cameos takes away nothing from the surreal portraying of nearly all the characters. Ralph Fiennes is very good as the master concierge and his delivery is well timed. Another character I really enjoyed was the one played by Willem Dafoe who hardly says anything during the whole film. It just shows the level of art in this film. Light and dark Entertainment at its best."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,9/10,"OK fine, I'm a Wes Anderson fan. I'm starting to gather that's a prerequisite for liking some of his movies. I like to think this one crosses over though. It's charming! It's wonderful. The characters are quirky but believable. The story is wacky but somehow holds water. It really feels layered and honest, and the convention of a story- within-a-story-within-a-story is used to excellent effect. If I had any complaints... hm. I can't think of any at the moment. I guess maybe I wish it was longer! It really held me captivated, and I know I sound like a gushy fanboy here but honestly I mainly like violent science fiction, so hopefully that lets you know I'm not just a total softie promoting things without weighing their merits. Anyway, if you are at all curious about this movie, I strongly recommend. Great performances by a fantastic cast. Funny."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 March 2015,5/10,"I do not see any drama worthy of praise in this film I'm not a writer or a film critic, but I am viewer and me the right question is it worth this film to enter the Oscars? The only thing worth praising the film is the soundtrack,but photography is very bad and some of the scenes by a stationary, stable images do not move where realism in this? Events are listed and the performance was by some representatives of artificiality,or in other words, over-representation of the limit.In the end, the film does not have a reason to run for Oscar not to take 4 prizes"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 December 2014,10/10,"Just like the painting which the movie revolves around the grand Budapest hotel is absolutely beautiful in every way and very unique. Just like the painter who painted the picture, Director Wes Anderson has truly outdone himself and this may just be his masterpiece.The movie has depth and brilliant multiple stories which creatively come together to create an outstanding main story while still allowing for all stories to have relevance. The stories are told through unique and intriguing characters.The movie revolves around themes such as love, death, friendship, greed, and despair among other themes all told through fantastical and funny ways. The dark and unique humour combined with the great dialogue allows for such serious themes such as death and love to be laughed upon while still having relevance and intertwining perfectly to tell the brilliant story of The Grand Budapest Hotel. The movie has very good moral-values but its brilliance is how the moral-values are told through funny and unique ways.The acting in this movie is great with an outstanding cast led by an unbelievably good Ralph Fiennes. The unforgettable multiples cameos are a delight.The movie is stunning visually and I cannot help but admire the camera work, cinematography and beautiful locations and sets. The movie is very detailed and every detail is clearly well thought of. The immaculate attention to detail makes it very difficult to find a flaw in the movie because honestly the movie is flawless. The movie is extremely surreal and the perfect soundtrack adds to the surrealism while helping to create and depict the mood and tone.The Underlying question: Is it good and should you watch it? The answer is absolutely! The movie is very intriguing and unique. The Grand Budapest Hotel has all the ingredients for a great movie and takes you on an unforgettable journey through a wonderfully crafted wonderland, straight out of Anderson's brilliant head, parallel to no other! The only true downfall is that this movie does not appeal to everyone!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 March 2015,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is like a book in a book wrapped inside another book, telling the story of concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy Zero and how Ralph Fiennes's character was accused of a false crime and has to prove his innocence. This movie has everything, action, humor and even eye watering scenes. Mainly classified as a comedy,it wasn't a laugh out loud movie but relied mostly on a darker sense of humor with profanity and well execution of dialogue. You won't truly understand the film until you see it. Wes Anderson has almost created a fantasy universe, from the location to the dress code."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 November 2018,10/10,"I have, honest to god, seen this move a number of times succeeding that of my fingers. And every single time, it never ceases to amaze me.This movie is evidently, a beautiful one. Every scene, every prop, every colour, and every shot is so deliberate. Yet, the movie, in its entirety, extend far beyond a series of colourful and lavish shots. The dialogue is impeccable. Each character is given their own personality; a quirky set of dispositions that remain, throughout the movie, largely believable, and more importantly, strongly enforced. From Zero, to C. Gustave, to Agatha and Jopling, you are left, not only wishing them to be real, but very likely believing it yourself.On the surface, you may gather that this movie conveys a grand adventure, through the plains of all worlds, in recovery of a painting. It is very much a grand adventure, but this term should be applied to the relationship formed between Gustave and Zero. I find, that if you consider this notion when watching the movie, all the deliberation of camerawork, care in colour, and attention to detail will leave you truly amazed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2016,8/10,loved this movie and of how the narrator paints a picture of his past adventures.this movie had a therapeutic effect on me as of how a parallel is drawn between a hotel and a humans life.there is a calm stretching over the entire run time of the movie even though it is set with a backdrop of such a bright business. steadily paced the movie revolves around the concierge of the hotel Mr. Gustavu a hotelier with a keen sense for perfection and zero mustafa his apprentice and bell boy who inherit a legendary painting from a deciced patron who is Mr. Gustav's lover as well and are framed by her family for her murder. the ending is very poetic and should be watched by all people irrespective for their taste of calm and quiet movies or for masala flicks as it has a blend of both the aspects.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 December 2016,7/10,The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great movie that shows the rise and fall of a great hotel. It includes some of the most important incident in history without actually identifying them. It takes on some heavy material while keeping a light hearted feeling. This is one of Wes Andedson's best films that goes back in time to show what has become of the hotel. It shows how the owner first came to the hotel and that the only thing he could do is be M. Gustave's lobby boy because his family had been killed in the war.He becomes M. Gustave's right hand man. He inherits a lot of money and wealth from the death of M. Gustave but decides to buy the hotel instead because the girl that he loves always loved the hotel.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 August 2017,1/10,"Watched the entire movie, and really have nothing great to say about it. It did not catch any attention, the script is mundane, it is definitely over-hyped. It tries to come off as something very special, and with complex narrative, by creating this beautiful atmosphere, but delivers nothing to me. Honestly, 2 hours wasted. I did not find the movie philosophical or in any way profound."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 March 2018,8/10,"Wes Anderson is a master at using limited, but powerful color palettes, fast, witty dialogue, and character driven plots to create beautiful worlds with beautiful stories. He has never done better than The Grand Budapest Hotel. The Grand Budapest follows the adventure of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori) as they ""steal"" a priceless painting and try to find the missing second will of Madame D. (Tilda Swinton). We are told the story through the perspective of the Author (Jude Law) who is told the story through the perspective of Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). The film is rounded out with Anderson's usual cast of unusual characters; Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson with one time collaborator Saoirse Ronan.The film's pastel palette adds to the visual look with the bright pinks and reds of the hotel at its peak in the 30s and the muted oranges and greens of the hotel well passed its prime in the 60s. The comedic one-liners of M. Gustave parallel the more somber tones of Mr. Moustafa to combine to make a script that is sure to make you laugh and maybe even make you tear up at the end. The movie would not be complete without the beautiful score created by Alexandre Desplat which includes fast pace guitar with slow piano playing that add to the tones of both the 30s and 60s timelines."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 March 2014,9/10,"A meticulously crafted picture-book world, that are resided by decisively quirky characters, whose lives are governed by the principle of offbeat humor. These are the qualities that define what is almost a genre of its own that is a Wes Anderson film. In his most recent work, Anderson brings these qualities to yet another level with an unprecedented control and maturity.The Grand Budapest Hotel takes us to a made-up country deep in central Europe in the bygone era of the 1930's–the furthest away from here-and- now among all the Wes Anderson film destinations. Being a perfect concierge, the writer/director arranges a proper trip across the distance by triple-framing the core story: a girl visits the statue of a writer, who materializes on screen to recount his decades-old memory, in which the owner of a decrepit hotel of an old glory tells the story of m. Gustave H.. Once there, we are pampered, not only with the exquisite sets and locations of a grand scale and pleasing aesthetics, but also by the sweeping plot that grabs the viewer like no other Wes Anderson stories do.It would not be an exaggeration to call Ralph Fienne's m. Gustave H. the most fascinating and lovable Wes Anderson character that lived on screen. He is imperious, flamboyant, and finicky, and yet, gentle, delicate, and understanding. Arguably a ridiculous fellow, he still strikes us as a decent man, and through the narrator's affectionate eyes, is rendered as an endearing character that elicits a protective instinct from the viewer. We cannot take our eyes off the screen as he navigates through the threat of violence with squeamish grievances and stubborn adherence to his own peculiar set of protocols.An astonishing thing about The Grand Budapest Hotel is how it evokes complex emotions about rather unsuspected subjects. There surely is the bittersweet nostalgia about the world long lost, but there is something more. Although what m. Gustave is running away from is neither totalitarianism nor the threat of a war, we catch ourselves subconsciously grieving this aspect of the history by the end of the story. It is this tinge of soulfulness that makes The Grand Budapest Hotel truly special.I came to see Wes Anderson's films as perfectly confected pieces of pastry with tiny hammers and chisels in them. They allow us to escape from the banality and brutality of reality. Two hours in his theater is our brief stay in a grand old hotel of fantasy. As I realized, escapism is not just analgesic, but it can also be therapeutic. Escapism at its best allows us to address obliquely the things that are difficult to be faced headlong. In its strange way, it helps us cope. And of course, it takes us to wonderful places that delight our hearts and expand our world."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 August 2018,8/10,"This show is amazing. The acting is superb, the plot is convulated, absurd but captivating. The film is also filled with humour, sometimes dark. Wes Anderson really did a good job."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2019,2/10,"I agree with a few of the other posts in that this is one of the few instances where my rating of the movie differs greatly from the avg IMDB user. I was excited to finally see this movie, and the first 15 minutes gave it a lot of promise. After that, the movie drug on without much excitement, comedy, or character development for the first half only to establish a lazy and played out plot for the second half. All of the great actors that show-up throughout the film have their talents wasted.This film is another great example of critics and film geeks lining up to shower praise on a film that a viewer could take a 45 minute nap and not miss a single thing. If you want a laugh, read the critics reviews on Rotten Tomatoes as they fall over themselves trying to praise the film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 August 2018,3/10,"You know the type: Birdman or The Shape of Water, etc Films that make no sense and are largely boring too."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 April 2020,10/10,"Amazingly enjoyable😍😍
Story telling is too good
Damn it's beautifully directed..."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2019,10/10,"The Grand Budapest hotel was written and Directed by Wes Anderson. The Film was released in 2014, and was based in part on a series of short stories written by Stefan Zweig. The film stars Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori as a pair of hotel workers at the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film won 4 Oscars and was nominated for another five. This is Anderson's seventh feature length film, as well as his most successful.The film revolves around the characters of M. Gustave, as played by Ralph Fiennes, and Zero, Tony Revolori, Gustave is a concierge at the Grand Budapest, and Zero is his lobby Boy. After Gustave is framed for murder, the two are forced to unravel the mystery behind the death and clear Gustave's name.The sheer beauty of this film is breath-taking. Never before in a film have I seen such vibrant and detailed scenes and backgrounds. Each frame looks like it could be its own painting. The cinematography is excellent, and the film has its own distinctive and independent style I have not seen in any other film. The plot of the film, as well as its pacing, is also wonderful. It's a fascinating plot about mystery and humour.The acting in this film, while of times fast paced, rings true and is full of genuine emotion. The relationships between the characters is extraordinary and fascinating. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori's relationship is one of the greatest highlights of the film. A nice little detail to note is that despite the film set in a fictional Germanic country, all of the actors retain their own native accents. This particularly evident with the characters played by Saorise Ronan and Jeff Goldbloom, who Irish and American accents respectively, are extremely distinct from anyone else in the film. This is interesting as the Director, Wes Anderson, hired these people based solely on their acting ability, their nationality and their ability to speak with an accent was not considered.I find it difficult to think of any negatives about this film. The only one I can think of is that some people had issues with the ending, but I think it ended perfectly. Such as it was.The Grand Budapest, to me at least, is a masterpiece. Filled with wonderful performances, a great plot and absolutely amazing cinematography, it is one of my favourite films I have ever seen.Without a doubt the Grand Budapest Hotel is a perfect Ten out of Ten for me."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 June 2019,9/10,I thought the acting was superb. The ambiance of the hotel was very luxurious looking. The scenery was beautiful. The story-line was excellent. It started very good and t ended excellent. Highly recommend.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2020,10/10,The grand Budapest hotel was a soothing poem and a combination of eye-catching and charming paintings.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 August 2021,7/10,"This Movie has a Very Unique Kind Of Storytelling and Direction, The Movie actually has Zero plot but Its interesting to watch till the end because of the Unique direction, Good Performance from Actors and the cool bgm!!."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 February 2021,2/10,"This movie can put you to sleep everytime you want to. Poor story. Poor direction. Don't waste your time and money.
I watched this due to high ratings. I think everyone who suffered this torture wanted others to suffer so they rated it high"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 October 2021,10/10,"As a person who watches many movies, this is my favourite. The cinematography, the comedy, the writing, the aesthetic, and pretty much everything else is perfect. The main criticism that I see for this film is that it is so focused on setting a vibe that the writing and story are boring and underwhelming. This is COMPLETELY FALSE. The story is a romance, comedy, crime-thriller, war tragedy and it nails everything it tries to do. It balances the violent crime themes with a beautiful story about a hotel and it's perfectionist concierge in the nineteen thirty's. I keep trying to find an issue with this movie but I can't. It's as perfect as perfect can be and honestly, I recommend it to anyone who has a love of film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 May 2021,7/10,Loved to watch the movie.. It was really soothing and delicate to watch.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 October 2021,8/10,"One can say it's like watching children playing in the playground. Playful, colourful, immaculate. And of course beautifully shot. Joyful score perfectly complemented every shot and scene playfully. Wes Anderson's masterpiece."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 March 2014,5/10,"I saw this movie this evening with a feeling of anticipation. After ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (my own personal Anderson favorite), I was somewhat skeptical that he could top my favorite, and my skepticism was justified. It was colorful, and had quite a few laughs, but that's about it. A lot of actors were quite simply under-used. Tilda Swinton had so little to do that a simple portrait of her would have sufficed. Bill Murray with his oh-so-obvious American accent was totally out of place. I suppose if I had read the works of Stefan Zweig, I might have enjoyed this movie more than I did. But then there's the possibility that I wouldn't have enjoyed Zweig either. Over the years, I have come to judge movies by whether or not I would want to view it more than once, and perhaps purchase a copy of it. I have a copy of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" which I have viewed a number of times. It is part of small collection that I like to watch on occasion. Sadly, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" will never be part of this collection."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2015,6/10,"I don't care for Wes Anderson. Every time trailers give me the impression it's going to be funny, I'm deeply disappointed. For me, Wes Anderson's works range from stupid to really stupid. Grand Budapest Hotel is typically stupid. What makes it a little better is the true humor of the sets and costumes. From the Easter egg candy colored hotel with delightful columns, a grand stair-step tram to raise visitors to the heights of the hotel's entrance, delightful hotel staff costumes and villains costumed in traditional black, this Wes Anderson did give this viewer one arena of entertainment that the rest, acting, story (what story?), plot (what plot?), characterizations (who cared about any of them?) lacked. I did enjoy the stellar cast. I think they do Wes Anderson's films because making them must be fun. My favorite of the cast? Jeff Goldblum. I liked his character. And his was the only character about whom I had any feeling for care or concern.Will I ever watch a Wes Anderson film? Yes, but only for the reason I dragged myself through it this time-- it was on the IMDb 250 top films list on the 31st of December. For those who like Wes Anderson, your sense of comedy is different from mine, not better, just different. As for me, I think I'll go back to Woody Allen films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 September 2019,10/10,"Costumes, makeup, music, performances, direction, cinematography, script, cameos, actor's own accents, Boy With Apple... all sublime.
The only problem I have with this masterpiece is that it wasn't 5 hours longer."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 February 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson (The royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom) is a name that's known to most people because the world he creates in his films are so eccentric and unique to him that no one else can do it.The Grand Budapest hotel is a Wes Anderson film down to his very core. It has all his classic techniques such as push in, whip pans, camera moves with dialogs, title cards etc. The films draws on the writing of Viennese intellectual Stefan zweig. In the Grand Budapest hotel we are transported back to 1932 by Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) the owner of the Grand Budapest hotel. He tells writer (Jude law) how he came into possession of the hotel.Wes Anderson has not only mastered the art of auteur directing he has also made a name for himself as a story teller this is why there is a big line up of Hollywood stars begging to be in his film. He definitely uses this to his advantage as we can see The grand Budapest hotel has one of the most colorful cast list of the year.Wes Anderson has provided Ralph Fiennes with one of his most distinguished roles playing Gustav H the powerful concierge at the head of the establishment. He is a well knowledged, well dressed well-spoken and well-mannered man. He also has a dirty habit of bedding old rich ladies most notably Madame D (Tilda Swinton). She passes away and wills her priceless painting Boy with Apple to Gustav H leading to fighting frenzy with her son Dimitir (Adrien Brody) and Jopling (William Defoe).During this fight he is helped by Zero (Tony Revolori). Newcomer Tony Revolori has definitely made a name for him self as actor to watch out for. His on screen charm with Ralph Fiennes as they travel the countryside with various forces on their tail is mesmerizing. During this journey is where we see why The Grand Budapest hotel is the ultimate Wes Anderson film. The traveling with forces on their tails is similar to that of The Darjeeling limited as it mostly takes place on trains, the goofy romance that zero has with Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is very similar to Moonrise Kingdom. All Wes Anderson fans will bow to the wonders of this film and non fans will be automatically converted."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 November 2020,9/10,"This is absolutely one of the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Everything look so perfect: direction, photography, editing, acting. The cast is full of star, but I want to make a special mention to Tony Revolori in the role of the Lobby Boy. This movie bring me in a spiral of emotions from the first to the last minute of it. I wish I could watch much more movie like this in my life!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,3/10,"After reading on line that this was up for an Oscar and saw the many celebrities in the cast I was anxious to see this film. I think I laughed once during the entire film. Maybe I am dense or maybe I am the wrong nationally to enjoy this flick, but I just didn't get it. I actually fell asleep I was so bored. I was very disappointed as I love Ralph Fiennes but I felt this role was totally beneath him. Also the portrayal of a main character when he was older was totally off...confused me terribly. I did however enjoy the scenery thought it was beautifully done. Perhaps I should read the book and then I would understand exactly what was going on. Again it bored me, I was waiting for something exciting to happen and I felt as though it never did."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 November 2018,1/10,"I think it is my first review, I think so.Well what I want to say is that I very much want to sue the maker of this movie and also the voters who have given more than minimum possible rating.Come on guys, are we kids? Who can give me back my precious time wasted on this ...... I don't know what to say it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 December 2020,8/10,A film that leaves a hot chocolate taste in the mouth. The colors are used very well.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2014,10/10,"I think The Grand Budapest Hotel is an excellent film and a lot of people seem to agree with me. This movie is expertly crafted including details such as the aspect ratio changing so it matches that of what time period it is based in. This movie is mostly done with special effects including old effects such as when a character has a nose bleed the blood painted on does not match up to their nostril and they use many painted backdrops in the film. The only scene that bothered me in the movie was the CGI skiing scene, it's not a bad scene it's just the CGI used looks a bit out of place considering the rest of the movie but that's my only problem with the movie. I'll begin to talk about the well-crafted plot now. The whole movie is based off the works of Stefan Zweig who wrote stories of eccentric characters just like Wes Anderson and I imagine Wes Anderson is inspired by him. The movie starts off in the fictional country of the Republic of Zubrowka after the author begins to tell the story. The year is 1968 and the young author has traveled to Zubrowka now devastated by war. The author is staying in The Grand Budapest Hotel which is now run down and weathered by time. The author meets the owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa. Zero explains why he now owns the hotel and why he wants to keep it open. The main plot now begins with the eccentric M. Gustave, the hotels' concierge who is with Madame D. one of the many older women M. Gustave 'escorts'. Madame D. feels this will be the last time she will ever see M. Gustave, before being sent off she says how much she loves M. Gustave. She is found dead soon after and M. Gustave is accused of being the murderer but he is also left in her will the priceless painting 'Boy with apple'. The plot then goes with the events that follow. This movie is filled with excellent performances by Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan and the newcomer Tony Revolori. After I saw this movie I couldn't stop thinking and talking about it for weeks a thing I think all good movies should be able to do, I give this movie a solid 10 out of 10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 January 2015,6/10,"First thing that occurred to me watching this flick: The director saw ""The Shining"". And, I'm guessing, maybe a lot of ""end of"" or ""bygone era"" movies. But the picture can't seem to make up its mind whether it loves the past or thinks it silly. Because the credits don't roll until the drama is over I spent a lot of time thinking, ""Oh, yeah, what's his name? He's older now too."" That was diverting. And the acting was well-executed but kind of ""showed"" a lot, it seemed to me. I'm not saying I'm sorry I saw the movie. But I kept wondering while I was watching if it was one of those boardgames adapted to the screen. Perhaps I have lost my sense of humor? Was I expecting an homage and viewed a satire instead? But perhaps that is what I found missing: I was never quite sure how the director wanted me to take the movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2018,8/10,"Keeps your eyes with the movie all time, even when the matter is serious it is able to show it in simple and light way.I like the way they move on the screen ... like Old days movies.:)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 January 2015,9/10,"When I watch the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" had not read anything about the movie. I found a work of art, full of intelligent humor that at times borders on the absurd. Visually it is an attractive product, the colors, the clothes, the time unfolds ... It has a simple story easy to follow and allows us to keep pace with rapid dialogues between the characters. The scenes pass quickly, at a rate that requires the attention of the audience. This is also why we must be careful not to lose the jokes ... some black humor. Is a beautiful hours of film and good humor. Is perceived-that behind this film is a competent technical team of post production. It's a movie not to be missed, but will not be guaranteed awarded the Academy Award for Best Film of the Year, given the good quality of the other nominees."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 June 2014,10/10,"The grand Budapest hotel was one of the best movies I've ever seen The witty comedy and just the great story line made me adore this film. The acting is great,the plot is great, and the writing is perfect. The witty comedy is some of the best I've seen in years. Every minute in that film was entertaining, Ralph Fiennes nailed his part and even the new comer Tony Revolori did too. The effects in the movie were awesome, they almost looked fake. The way that they shot this too was neat, the did camera pans instead of a whole new scene, All in all this movie was amazing, I came in it with real high expectations and I was amused. Hope this was helpful ~ Bryce Alec"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 January 2015,9/10,"This is such a delightful film. I recent just re-watched and liked it even more. The story beings with a young author (Jude Law) meeting the eccentric owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Moustafa proceeds to tell the tale of how he became the owner of the hotel centering on concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his Lobby Boy Zero (Tony Revolori). Gustave is a beloved concierge often wining the affection of guests of the hotel. This affection gets Gustave in trouble after a guest is murdered and a valuable painting is stolen with him as the prime suspect. The story includes prison life, prison break, a chase, more murders, a mystery, and even Nazi-like soldiers wrapped up with comedy, drama, action, and romance. The movie was really about the relationship between Gustave and Zero with the mystery just a vehicle to deliver performances of the actors. Fiennes and Revolori nailed it! Finnes had perfect comedic timing with dramatic intensity when need be. I feel this was his best performance, save Schindler's list and should have nominated for Academy Award. The supporting characters, a who's who of award winning actors, included Adrien Brody, William Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Bill Murrayand others also had exceptional performance. I think Norton's performance was better in Grand Budapest than in Birdman. In addition to getting the most from his actors, Wes Anderson created a wonderful world and used interesting filming techniques (reminiscent of Monty Python). Despite being a little confused keeping track all the names of the characters (the butler, the butler's sisters, the inmates), it was the enduring characters that I will remember most."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2015,10/10,I see the reviews here for this movie and must say that I am amazed as a 63 year old man (especially for the other gent who gave his age) this movie is just magical I really loved this and predict that it will beat the odds on shot (boyhood) for the best movie Oscar if there i8s any justice. Watch this with an open mind and it will delight you. I watched this not really knowing what to expect but found it to be a wonderland of intrigue . From the very beginning it will lead you through a kaleidescope of mystery and the way the stories all blend together really made me think that the money spent to watch this was well spent. As to people who walked out half way through it serves you right you needed to see the whole thing for all the pieces to fit
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 December 2018,,"The main characteristic of this film is its visual style and charisma. The scenes are rich with nicely combined colours, particularly pastel ones, and symmetries are everywhere. Relationships between characters are fantastic and extremely well written. Dialogues are witty and interwined with funny dark humour. Pure brilliance!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2014,9/10,"Wes Anderson fans, rest assured, this is Wes Anderson's most ""Wes Anderson"" film to date. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a beautifully crafted, encapsulating period piece that oozes the playful, energetic notes the director is known for. The Grand Budapest Hotel is the story of Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), a refugee of a far-flung, difficult to pronounce eastern country and how he comes to own a copious amount of his new found fictional home, Zubrowka, including the hotel itself. The film's pacing is good; regularly narrated by an aged version of Jude Law's young writer character who recounts Zero's story to the audience word-for-word, just as he'd heard from an aged Zero when he was passing through the then less voluptuous hotel when he himself was a younger, travelling man. The hilariously quirky plot is driven by two interesting and likable though not the most relatable characters and a host of brief cameo-like appearances from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzmann and now Harvey Keitel. Adrien Brody's ravenous Dmitri (Mme D's son), Jeff Goldblum's stern-willed attorney and Willem Dafoe's cold killer are also particularly commendable performances. Ralph Fiennes' truly incredible performance as M. Gustave is what really carries this film in my opinion though; Revolori's young, meek Zero is rightly outshined by Gustave's massive personality which helps us to watch their friendship develop and their social status steadily change with clarity. Not too dissimilar from DeNiro as Ace in Scorsese's ""Casino"", Gustave is the man in charge at the Grand Budapest and does so with panache. Fiennes plays Gustave fearsomely such that he is never without his social airs and graces whether he's front of house or in prison but to his staff he as strict as what you expect someone who runs one of the finest establishments in the world should be. Gustave is not completely above board though; he has a promiscuous side too, regularly sleeping with regular elderly female guests (""I sleep with most of my friends"") which ultimately drives the plot of the film. Mme D (Tilda Swinton), one of Gustave's most beloved blonde lady guests dies early in the film and whilst attempting to say a final goodbye he finds out that she bequeathed him a highly desirable priceless painting, ""Boy with apple"" in her will. The film unfolds as we follow Zero and Gustave as they fight to honour (slightly greedily) Mme D's final wishes and expose the malicious nature of her money hungry family. The screen writing is excellent with lots of great exchanges of witty dialogue between Zero, Gustave and the other characters that had me in stitches (Zero's interview, for example) and really helped to keep their actions believable. Nothing is forgotten here, there's actually something for everyone whether you're a fan of drama, romance, comedy or action. I liked how from the opening shot to the ending credits, Anderson's trademark style is apparent and as lovable as always. His different shots of the stunningly designed and vibrantly coloured hotel sets absorb you into the film's isolated pseudo-eastern European world. Countless panning shots tracking people down hallways give you a sense of the hotels scale, the rotation of the camera on vertical and horizontal axis too made me feel like I was manipulating my own neck to look up to that hotel window or look round that corner in the prison; not to mention the Kubrick-esque still camera shots of the hotel that were particularly impactful. Another example of the masterful cinematography on offer was the fantastic depth of field scenes, notable ones being an early inter-bathtub exchange and when Gustave is chased from the hotel reception desk to the stairs by Edward Norton's character and his gang of henchmen. As well as all this there were the little things such as familiar-feeling fonts, close-ups of objects on surfaces, flashes of snappy animation, a stylish score and clever use of aspect ratio and the AndersonTM Instagram-like colour grading to indicate the time period just kept me smiling all the way through. I saw the first showing of this film in my area, granted it was in the middle of the day there were still only 4 or 5 people in the cinema with me and as much as I'd love to see it kill in the box-office I can't imagine it will. Films of this like, especially Wes Anderson's, are not really made for the masses (explosions, Marvel characters) but instead more, I believe, for the joy of making films eg. Bottle Rocket. It really looked like all the actors knew this too and truly were enjoying themselves (like how each character doesn't just turn up in the film, they make an appearance) and that made me want to enjoy it more and more. The Grand Budapest hotel is a wonderful experience, transporting you to a different world in an outstandingly convincing fashion; so overall I'd have to say it was ""very gooood""."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2018,9/10,"For me this was the greatest comedy with a special kind of humor.
The makeup was great, the actors were chosen well and the action is very exciting.
This movie got all the things you are searching for:
comedy!
drama! 
adventure! 
action! 
great actors!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (Directed by Wes Anderson) had earned it's place as one of my top favorites. The overall theme included a variety of cinematic styles unlike what i've admired in most modern movies; it continues to amaze me throughout the chapters. Every scene of the film is perfectly detailed in every way. Vibrant and colorful, both emphasized by the absolutely impressive effects. Though the story is set during the war, Anderson managed to bring humor out even at the most inappropriate times associated with his amusing violence. Pacing of the movie moves relatively fast as we progress through the movie. Inspired by that, music plays an essential part giving its watchers a comical sense of the 90's.The story revolves around different time-lines from beginning to end; It contains so many aspects i've come to love, with absurdly amazing camera angles. This has certainly been one of Wes Anderson's best works and possibly one of the best movies released this year. A highly recommended watch for those who has not, as i am sure the other 190,000 users would agree."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,7/10,"From the first few minutes of this movie, I knew I was going to have a problem with the way Wes Anderson decided to tell his charming story about The Grand Budapest Hotel.It opens with a girl (presumably modern day) reading a book written by the Author who narrates, then goes to a younger version of the Author who takes over as narrator, and then for the rest of the movie switches narrators between the young Author and the old Zero. It may seem nit-picky of me, but I felt the movie would have had more focus if they cut out the girl and the older Author all together and instead focused the story on the young Author being told this story by the older Zero.The end also felt a bit rushed, for me, and I didn't find it as satisfying as I had hoped. The deaths of both Gustave and Agatha in the end were upsetting, but felt almost like an afterthought.Other than that, I enjoyed the actual story a lot. It was funny and had that typical Wes Anderson style that I love so much. Perhaps it may even be his most Wes Anderson-y film yet."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 April 2014,10/10,"No amount of superfluous adjectives give justice to the magic and whimsical spectacle that is the Grand Budapest Hotel. A theatrical masterpiece for the age, its whit and insight that of ""Alice in Wonderland"" being a social blueprint of days gone past from an age characterised by crumbling aristocracy brought down by personal vendetta and political crossfire. The Grand Hotel is a beacon for not only simpler times but where careful thought and attention to detail never escapes the graceful eye of Wes Anderson.A humble lobby boy, dutifully plays 2nd fiddle to the gallivanting Monsieur Gustave. An apprenticeship he is more than willing to undertake and displays heroism by being Gustave's unassuming personal valet. Their escapades and knack for seductive diplomacy with pinch of bluntness at the right moments, leaves their opponents dumbfounded and red-faced at being openly defied by Gustave's silver tongue. Anderson marvels in the spotlight and intrigues viewers with his eccentricity and attention to detail. The cast is equally in captivity within the sumptuous surrounds of the scenery. As an audience we really are being killed with kindness and seduced by its grandeur. The protagonists' self sacrifice and service as Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) as the noble concierge and patron of fine culture is certainly no pushover. His loyalty to his trade and his defiance to all that is brutish and uncivilised leaves him as an outsider, isolated in ideology yet unshakably determined that good intentions will always prevail. Nothing quite exceeds like excess, the beauty is in the detail.The Grand Budapest Hotel is not immune to global forces of change, the tides of days past slowly drawing away. Perhaps nostalgic or even utopian, the isolation of the grand mountain resort for playboys and patronesses' conflicts with the mundane and mediocrity of common trivial matters of daily life. A fantasy camp caught up in stroking its own image of superiority of finer culture, the crumbling and dilapidated facade begins the story of how hands clamoured for an apple of purity which no amount of money or abrupt influence could be forced at to posses. A truly marvellous and playful spectacle to see. Its eccentricity its edge.TC"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 April 2014,9/10,"I was late to watching this glorious movie directed by Wes Anderson. It was extremely fun to watch. His execution and signature style amazed me throughout. I was worried about the large cast but once it started it was impossible not to be hooked. Ralph Fiennes was a powerhouse and really drew everything together. It was smart too. I laughed at jokes that were repeated from earlier in the movie and laughed in general at the cast of ridiculous hooligans. Not only was the cast amazing, the cut scenes that have the ""Wes Anderson"" are so enjoyable and I said out loud, ""Wow, that looks amazing"". It was such a great theater experience and I would recommend this movie to anyone. So bring your dad, your girlfriend, sister, mom, and even grandparents. There is some swearing but if you know a young film-lover, take them to this! They will remember it forever.Cheers."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 May 2014,8/10,"Wes Anderson possesses a completely rare among American filmmakers gift of having his own style of making movies. Even though plot of each of them is constructed very carefully, he treats all characters with equal dose of care. In fact, their peculiar personalities have become a kind of trademark of Anderson's storytelling. This feature could be even noticed in his Oscar nominated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", which, even though had children as target audience, still managed to convey his characteristic style. Anderson's the latest movie is not an exception. Even though his movies do not belong to high budget genres, Anderson always manages to collect impressive staff of experienced and famous actor. And so we have Ralph Fiennes as Mr. Gustave, a concierge of the title hotel, and Mustafa Zero, his newly-appointee lobby boy. The duo is thrown into a middle of shaking their calm existence events, when it turns out that the hotel's deceased owner, Madame D., leaves in the concierge's possession an invaluable painting, which for Mr. Gustave becomes both of chance for economic and source of hatred deriving from ravenous Madame D's son, who tries to take it back at all cost. The main plot, which is filled with authentically hilarious gags, wonderfully develops a relationship between the duo of Mr. Gustave and Zero. During the plot's progress, it changes from conversations typical for relation between worker and employer to something more like fellowship. Moreover, thanks to great performance of Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, the relationship is both of pleasantly amusing and poignant. Adrien Brody successfully breaks with his amiable image in order to create a completely grotesque character. It's also heartwarming to see F. Murray Abraham, who, after many years of performing in questionable quality movies, once again gives an performance in movie worthy of his talent. Although the it is not the best movie of Wes Anderson, it does successfully maintain his image of one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers of modern times. The idea of filming using different angles is quite interesting. The nowadays events are filmed by wide-angled lens, while the past is shown in 4:3 format, which wonderfully helps in conveying specific mood of the movie. Moreover, the director's kind of humor once again does not fail. Not only the jokes are amusing, but also very clever and unpredictable. I hope Wes Anderson will manage to maintain his exquisite style and not once entertain his viewers with his wit accuracy and creativity."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 August 2017,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has it all: great actors, an interesting story-line, beautiful cinematography, a dreamlike set, and of course a brilliant director. Ralph Fiennes, who played M. Gustave, was the perfect concierge. He not only embraced the intimate role of the concierge, but he somehow ""completed"" those words on the screenplay in a way that most actors could not. I have to say that the entire cast made a stellar performance on this film, but sadly cannot name them all as I would run out of space to write the film review. M. Gustav and Zero's relationship throughout the film was a pleasure to watch. It was funny to see them from the very beginning, when they had first met, to the point where they trusted one another with their lives. In a way, they became the family they'd always missed.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's style, the colours, the patterns, the comedy, the symmetry, and all that jazz--you won't be disappointed. The sets are beautiful (no wonder they won an Oscar for Production Design) and the costumes are very well put together (another Oscar there).Wes Anderson has created a masterpiece--a literal piece of artwork that will be praised for decades to come."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 February 2015,8/10,"First of all I have to say that I'd been really looking forward to seeing this film, and all though I'm pleased to say that it was a good movie, I was kind of sitting there in the end wondering what the f*** I'd just seen. I think it's because of the editing and the characters all put together, it's weird and special and it somewhat reminded me of a very dorky friend of mine - because it's all happening so fast and the story, all though it's complex, is weird. But I can't say that it doesn't deserve the attention it's been given.Because let's look at the facts; it got four nominations at the Golden Globes, one nomination turned out to be a win: the best motion picture - Comedy or musical. And now, with the Oscars coming up I was sure it was going to get nominated for something there too - and guess what, if you haven't already seen it, it's nominated for 9 different things! We're talking: Best motion picture of the year, best achievement in directing, best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, best achievement in cinematography, best achievement in editing, best achievement in production design, best achievement in costume design, best achievement in makeup and hairstyling and best achievement in music written for motion pictures, original score.So we can just face the fact that the movie looks amazing on the screen, everything combined it's beautiful, and pleasing for the eye. It's chaotic, but the chaos is so well organized that we just love it. We're never bored, and we're always wondering what's going on with the characters. With actors and actresses like presented in this movie, we can't do anything but be amazed by the way they've made everything come together. With so many profiled actors and actresses, so many good actors and actresses, I personally was proud of the movie, and I'm not even in it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 August 2015,8/10,"All of Wes Anderson's films are cut from the same cloth; this is not an indictment of the talented filmmaker. He has a unique voice using which he leaves a very identifiable mark on his films. The quirky characters, the colourful dialogue and some very inventive camera-work make his films very recognisably his work. The Grand Budapest Hotel fits very nicely into his oeuvre and might possibly be his funniest film yet. It is at once a touching and at times a very goofy film that not only follows the Anderson aesthetic closely but allows the director to explore his creativity in a slightly edgier fashion. The film employs three different timelines each of which is presented with a different aspect ratio. We first meet a man simply called 'The Author' (Tom Wilkinson), who describes to us a story that was narrated to him by the mysterious owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel Mr Zero Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham). The old man tells the author the tale of how he came to own the Grand Budapest. He was a lowly lobby boy in that very hotel under the tutelage of the Hotel's colourful and quirky concierge Monsieur Gustave H., who has a habit of (ahem) socialising with the hotel's more affluent visitors. One such visitor with whom he was particularly close, Madame D is found dead under mysterious circumstances and it is revealed that she has left a valuable painting much to the chagrin of her scheming son Dmitri (Adrien Brody). Some secrets are revealed and Gustave and Zero find themselves in the midst of several entanglements and chaos ensues. Now, strictly speaking the Anderson's style is something that takes some getting used to for the uninitiated. But, he possesses the singular ability to populate every frame with offbeat imagery and to use the camera in such a way as to mine humour out of every scene. The way characters move, the manner in which certain scenes unfold makes the film visually very engaging. The dialogue follows in the footsteps of the film's visual chicanery. The interactions are once touching and often really funny. The only real problem is that at times all this whimsical wizardry gets in the way of the storytelling. This gives the picture a sense of being slight and this somewhat blunts the emotional impact of the story. The constant levity undermines the effect that the ending ought to have. While Anderson has been guilty of this before it has not been as apparent as it is here. Though, to be fair the aforementioned levity does impart the more violent and gratuitous scenes an irreverence that is refreshing. The romantic aspects of his stories have always been Anderson's forte and he handles it with a deft hand. Another interesting aspect of this production is the art direction. In an age where most filmmakers chose to go for either grand set designs or elaborate computer generated backdrops, Anderson has chosen to go in for old school painted backgrounds and some very cleverly employed miniatures that do an excellent job of creating the colourful world in which these characters reside. The camera-work and the background score complement the quirky tone of the script as well. The story takes place in a fictional European nation called Zubrowka in a World War II like setting and the efficient execution of these technical aspects makes this world come alive beautifully. Even though Zero is the one telling the story through The Author, Gustave H. is the focus of the story and Ralph Fiennes proves to be an inspired bit of casting. Much of the film's humour and all its key moments are made memorable by his excellent timing and screen presence. He brings to Gustave great poise and grace without sacrificing the humour. We see the younger Zero on screen for a lot longer than his older counterpart and for that part the director has chosen newcomer Tony Revolori. Even though there is nothing especially memorable about the young actor's performance he does an adequate job of engaging in some very funny and at insightful banter with his mentor. One thing that sticks out as just a tad conspicuously though is the actor's use of a posh American accent for a character that hails from a supposedly middle-eastern background. Adrien Brody as Dmitri de Goffe und Taxis plays a straightforward one dimensional villain. Though, the actor does have some fun with the role. Willem Defoe as his henchmen Jopling sees the actor bring a creepy menace to the role that is unsettling. The film has very large and diverse secondary cast with actors like Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton occupying small roles that could easily be missed in the flurry of all the frenzy. The Grand Budapest Hotel does not quite hit the emotional highs of its maker's previous effort Moonrise Kingdom (2012). But it is still a solid effort from a man from whom his admirers (this author included) have come to expect a great many quirky cinematic delights and on that count The Grand Budapest Hotel does not disappoint."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 January 2015,10/10,"When I first seen the TV commercials for this film I was very curious of what it may hold. Here I am, nearly a year after. After watching the film I was certainly impressed and satisfied, for what I seen in the trailers was a peachy movie. Now I see it as a perfect comedy/drama film. This film remains to this day (or the day that this is posted) my favorite movie. Despite its ""perfect"" tone it is truly a amazing film and will go down in history (in my opinion) as one of the greatest films of all time. It was nominated for many awards and if I was to decide, I think that all of them shall be awarded to them. Wes Anderson impressed us all (if not most of us) once again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 February 2015,8/10,"+ Storytelling: The story is told in a series of flashbacks which is narrated out.+ Ralph Fiennes: Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performances with wonderful dialog delivery filled with humor and expression.+ Cinematography: Cinematography is beautiful.Plot: Not convincing at all.Screenplay: Ridden with holes. Slow as well.Direction: Over the top and pretentious to say the least.I have never been a fan of Wes Anderson's films owing to their cartoons and funny sets with weird make-up. However, I was surprised to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel with utmost sincerity in terms of performance, story telling and brilliant direction.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells the adventure of Gustave H who is a manager at the The Grand Budapest Hotel along with the lobby boy Zero.Wes Anderson had changed my feelings towards his films with sheer direction and convincing screenplay. The story is well-told in the flashback mode and narration is simply superb keeping you on your toes right from the beginning till the end.The movie is a thorough entertainer and the prison break scene will add extra spice. The background score is superb along with beautiful cinematography and art direction. Editing is crisp. Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performances with wonderful dialog delivery filled with humor and expression. Tony Revolori gives adequate support and should go a long way.Overall, a brilliant movie to watch"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 February 2015,9/10,"A masterpiece"" would be an underrated word for this epic creation called ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Such a majestically written musical drama that shall dwell in the hearts of the audiences for years to come. This movie deserves all the accolades as far as acting, direction, script,dialogues and screenplay goes..... Ralph Fiennes does a marvellous job as always. Have been a fan of him ever since for his role as ""Amon Goeth"" in Schindler's List, and yet again he does a great job in a complete alternate character of M.Gustave in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". The entire cast, which consists of known faces such as Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Adrian Brody, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law really adds up to the icing on the cake as far as acting is concerned. Well the film has its own level of dark and violent moments, which in fact enhances the excitement levels even more. A must must watch for fans who are looking for a great adventure,well sort out comedy and a grand musical drama experience. This movie should be winning most of the Oscars this time as far as my thinking goes!!!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 June 2016,9/10,"Wes Anderson is simply an incredible director that can turn an idea that may seem ridiculous and use it to create an awe-inspiring, visual masterpiece. Not only is every scene drenched in vibrant colours, but each shot is perfectly symmetrical so that every moment is aesthetically pleasing for the viewer. The characters are really brought to life in this film. The charming, poetic and self assured Gustave H is an archetypal Wes Anderson character, a lovable yet flawed man with a dead pan humour. I loved the subtle, dry humour of the film that blends nicely with the occasional fast paced scene. I have enjoyed a few of Wes Anderson's films over the past few years but ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is undoubtedly, in my eyes, the most defined film of his, with his exceptional casting and natural pacing of the film. This is a film that is often misunderstood, and seen simply as a comedy. But it is clearly much more than that. This is a carefully designed tale, with a blend of ridiculous hilarity and subtle wittiness, which form a visually captivating movie with a complex plot and a colourful array of characters. It was a pleasure to watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 October 2019,10/10,"Quite simply, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a masterpiece. I'll even take it a step further by saying, that in my personal opinion, as someone whom has rated over 650 feature films on IMDB, it is firmly within the top ten. The reason? It has some of the best world-building in any film.I'm not simply talking about production design (though that was an Oscar well earned), I'm talking about replicating the kind of atmosphere associated with Europe within the works of Stefan Zweig. Anderson has taken something based on truth, and he's added his own wild, quirky and fictional essence to it. What do you get? Something original, yet surprisingly believable.Don't get me wrong, the film has a spectacular story, a great narrative, a great cast, with great performances, great costumes, great music, great cinematography (the use of different aspect ratios for different time periods is very clever, by the way). But overall, the thing which makes me truly love and adore this film is that it creates a world that I'd love to be in more than any other film world.It's escapism."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 January 2021,10/10,"I can rewatch this over and over and like fine wine it only gets better. It is my favorite film, and each time I watch it I am reacquainted with its quirky perfection. The script, the design, the pace, it's all so well done"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 March 2017,10/10,"Ralph Fiennes steals the show as Gustave , who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. But the real star is, of course, Wes Anderson. He is a Genius. In my opinion the most fabulous of all writer/directors past and present. I want to give him 1000 Oscars for every film he's ever made. Can't wait for the next one."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2019,10/10,"The movie shows a great use of cinematography and lighting and color. The most impressive part is the color in this movie. Every single shot is attractive to look at and it will keep you invested in the story if subtle funny dialogues are not your thing, The story is nothing exceptional, but it didn't needed to be anything other than what the story was. The sarcastic use of visual and written cliche was very appreciated a lot by me. The other thing I loved about the movie was how it was almost like a play I was watching live. Definitely watch this movie for what it is."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 December 2019,10/10,"The Russian army of World War One considered nostalgia an incurable contagious disease. A soldier who was considered to have ""contracted"" this ""disease"" was to be shot as if he was a deserter. If this principle was still the prevailing thought today, I, along with many of the characters of this masterful film, would meet the same fate as a Russian soldier.
M. Gustave H is a man so desperately trying to live his old world in a time that has so dramatically left him and his kind behind. Zero's visas MUST allow him passage, they always have.
Zero gave up a massive fortune to a presumably communist government, who possibly would have let him keep it otherwise, just to keep a reminder of his late beloved.
This movie is not what it seems. On the surface, this is a heist movie, a war movie, a comedy, and a picture of the old world where the rich still toured Europe. But this movie, while being all of that, is far, far more. It is a message that all things end. Zero's absolute desolation by the end of the film, his inability to move on from the ""good times"" before the war is a message to us to do just that. Do not linger on the good times until they are no longer. Move on.
Package all that into a beautifully framed package, and add some hilariously comedic dialogue, and you end up with the best movie of the decade."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 April 2019,1/10,"This is a tediously irritating, messy, pretentious and boring film which utilizes extremely uninteresting characters that rely on the 'weird' Wes Anderson humor/pacing (which I don't mind if what they where saying or doing was actually funny or had substance) in order to appear relevant as a character, in a VERY uninteresting story that keeps jumping from one line to another every 4 minutes.
The lobby boy was particularly awful. There was absolutely nothing special or endearing about him wich would make me believe that the main character would get attached to him. Which actually seemed to had happened from one second to another and for no particular reason.
Also, something that contributed to make me take the story less seriously was the casting of Murray Abraham as the adult version of a latin boy. It's like casting Beyonce to play the adult version of Elle Fanning. Just plain bizarre."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 October 2018,9/10,"Absolutely fell in love with this movie. 
You can't aliken this film to any other which is so refreshing. 
The casting was genius, the film was fun, thrilling, a little chilling at times but a real heart warmer. Ralph Fiennes was the perfect choice for this part and played it beautifully. The film takes you on a real journey, I was captivated the whole way through."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 May 2020,5/10,"I was watching this film , after greatly anticipating seeing it. Well, the corny narration and ZOOM IN'S really caught my attention. Where have I seen this before? Oh yes, The Royal Tananbaums.. It's a great story but ruined by this old style archaic way of shooting film. What's with the narration? Also,, the whole ZOOM lens thing.. very early 60's. One of the first things I learned in film school was the zoom lens, was invented,, and suddenly everyone started ZOOMING IN AND ZOOMING OUT. Until it was realized that it simply doesn't work. Film should reflect what the eye sees. The zoom does not reflect this. I found this film hard to watch, and horribly dated, even though it's brand new."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 December 2021,9/10,"This film is like a creme brûlé. I don't have it often, yet it's creamy, sweet texture remains in my memory.But those few moments that I do have it are filled with the most simplistic, basic feelings of enjoyment that-"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 November 2019,1/10,"Wes Anderson is my Least favourite director of all time. He is only liked by the yuppies and the barriests of the world. All of his movies suck. This was awful! Myb grandma liked it (""quirky"" appartnely) and well, all I could say was OK BOOMER expect that wasn't a thing thenTERRIBLE!
The characterss are really annoying and the plot is inspid."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 December 2019,10/10,"I've heard about thuis movie but never got the chance to watch it, but now with the holidays that came to an end.
I must say that al the good critics were true. The cinematics were beautiful, the acting was brilliant and it was fun to see all those A-list actors performing in big or small rolls.Conclusion: The best movie I've seen in years!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 August 2019,1/10,Boring and silly movie !!! Not recommended & waste of time !
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 March 2020,9/10,"To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 February 2020,9/10,I loved this film but I can understand that some people could easily dismiss it as just a farce/caper story. Wes Anderson fans who seek his story quirks and eccentric characters and people who are willing to immerse deep into the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel will feel the romance and nostalgic sadness of a bygone era. A time when magnificent hotels were built to cater for the boom of grand travel around the first half of the 20th century.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 April 2020,8/10,"Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors. It is his unique taste in portraying his movies which makes him stand apart.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is also one of his master creations.Describing the title of the movie itself, it has been said that the Grand Budapest Hotel was a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment and around this very hotel revolves our story. It is about the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge between the wars and his favorite lobby boy Zero Moustafa, who turns out to be his protége, his companion, his brother and also his sole heir. The story gains pace and interest when one of Gustava's close friend and client dies and leaves her priceless Renaissance painting to him. The battle for an enormous family fortune begins hence-- all against the back-drop of a suddenly and dramatically changing scenario. The war has its own role to play in the story.The narrative enthrals and mesmerizes the audience with the story. There's not one shot that seems dragged or uninteresting. According to me, the portrayal of the characters are the most important in this movie. How each character holds their personality till the end is remarkable.The movie's visuals are very charming. Certain frames look like paintings. If you are observant enough, you'd see shades of one particular colour in each of these frames, especially pink. This is one of the things about Wes Anderson's movies. He is very artistic in the way he portrays his movies. His approach is minimalistic, colourful and symmetric.In short, I would definitely recommend you to watch this movie and have a good time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2021,7/10,"Its a special type of movie!!enjoy it!
this movie have very nice actors and very very good genre!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 September 2020,9/10,"Another masterpiece by Wes Anderson and it stays consistent within his style of strange, obscure movies and settings with characters so close to reality but at the same time far away. A must see, without a doubt"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 February 2021,10/10,"This movie has amazing photography as a painting. Many scenes have humor. It is like a well-tuned clock, which works perfectly.it also has hidden meanings and messages for the evolution of man on a spiritual and cultural level."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2021,8/10,This is a a very well crafted film like all Wes Anderson's movies. THe only problem I always find is that they're predictable and carry the same tone throughout. No much room for surprises.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2021,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is truly something else. The aesthetic, camerawork, colours, characters, the most adorable interactions between these characters and the acting, all combined gives us this never seen before masterpiece. The whole time watching this I had a nostalgic feeling in my stomach. The feeling I would get as a child when reading a great book. I believe it is such because The grand Budapest hotel made me feel like I was reading a book. The movie was something only my adolescent imagination could made up when reading literature which can only mean this movie is clearly something of a dream."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2021,9/10,The Great Budapest Hotel is a great example of story telling. In fact is it about someone telling a story (not to give too much away). The visuals and excellent acting make this movie one of my favorites.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 November 2021,9/10,"It's hard to stop admiring the picture of this film, behind which is a lot of hard work by a team of cameramen, writer-directors and directors. The video footage, the colors, the details that create the atmosphere - it's all admirable.It's also impossible not to note the work of the cast - their acting allows you to develop a separate attitude to each character. Each character in the film gives unique emotions and reveals his own special story and character. What else is a sign of thoughtful directorial work - the large number of characters does not prevent the viewer from identifying the key ones who will play an iconic role later in the script.The story itself can be called a gripping tale. The funny thing is that even the darker moments do not evoke fear or negative emotions, most likely due to the background music and the overall positive, even perhaps playful, atmosphere of the movie.In this film I do not want to evaluate individual scenes, dialogues, moments, it is perceived as an overall, indivisible sample of cinematic art."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2014,10/10,"If you are familiar with Wes Craven, you know what to expect. And, of course he delivers. Grand Budapest in my opinion is his funniest film to date, mainly due to Ralph Fiennes.Anyone who is a fan of Ralph Fiennes will enjoy this movie. I have never seen him like this in a role. He had me laughing from beginning to end. Utterly charming and incandescent. I didn't know it was possible for me to admire him as an actor more than I already did, but sure enough he proved me wrong.The entire film is beautifully cast. Not one person is miscast. Everyone played off each other perfectly.If you want to see a film brilliantly acted that will touch your heart as much as entertain you from beginning to end, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2014,10/10,"Loved it Loved it. Loved it. Beautiful, funny, smart, silly, sad, fantastical. I will probably see this movie at least a dozen more times in my lifetime. Can't wait.Why is there a minimum of 10 lines required to make a review? Weird. Anyway...Ralph Fiennes is wonderful. Could end up being a signature role for him and one that is remembered for some time - although I keep forgetting his character's name. That's a problem.All the usual players show up and their all good to fantastic. Willem Defoe is especially fun. Adrian Brody might be the weakest featured player in the movie. He just doesn't quite seem to match up with the rest of what's going on. Same with Ed Norton, although he's less of a sore thumb. But they aren't problematic for the whole movie. Just very very minor distractions - for me, anyway.I just loved it. So much!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 July 2019,9/10,"I was put off watching this film by the polarised reviews on IMDB, then watched it and realised exactly why some of those reviews were so polarised - because some were looking for more in the film than a tall-tale beautifully and wonderfully told. To me it succeeds in telling that tale remarkably well. Some say it's pretentious, over-long and makes poor use of a ""stellar"" cast - I'd say it's none of those things myself, indeed the ""stars"" taking part might even be glad (and proud) they got to play even a small role in this truly remarkable, fantastic and silly-fun film. Stars don't always make a film remember."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 October 2020,10/10,The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably my favorite Wes Anderson movie so far. Not much more I can say.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 June 2019,9/10,"Such an amazing film I watched after a long time. Little comedy is so perfect and right on the plot. First half is story telling and second half is crime plus thrill. Difficult to decide who's the hero in the movie both the Lobby Boy and Gustave have a very strong character. I watched it with my wife and we literally paused, rewinded and discussed the scenes multiple times."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 June 2014,9/10,"Very well done. Each of the characters have a well though back story. The main character, M. Gustave represents the typical Concierge for a large full service hotel. Every guest loves him and he know each guests personal life, much like any modern concierge. He accomplice, or protégé, Zero has much to learn before one day taking the reins. The movie goes very slow throughout, yet Wes Anderson has a unique way of continue the story in a slow paced motion while continuing to advance the plot quickly. The narration was short, sweet, and to the point, not overdone or to an annoyance. The only issue I had with this movie was that you have to pay close attention to the subtitles and declaration of time. There is a lot of jump back between Past and Present."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 March 2014,9/10,"Web Anderson manages unlike anyone else to fully keep you captive without over-exploit aggressive scenes. He gets you engaged with intelligently sprinkled ridiculous scenes, exaggerated such to have you eagerly waiting for the next one. The unknown and unusual come in handy to build step by step the biography of a person flavorless at first sight - a lobby boy in a relatively isolated world, but who turns out to live his life very intensively. The main figure of the movie Mr. Gurtave H, is the quintessence of his generation: the concierge very strict and meticulous by all standards and energetic enough give life to a huge hotel in the middle of nowhere. Dialog is the tool which Anderson uses as main ingredient of his film to compensate for the best and most expensive special effects, and to outline all shapes of his characters."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2014,4/10,"I was very disappointed. At points I thought it could have been a good film; good actors, good decor, seemingly reasonable budget. With such a high rating I expected a decent film, however, it is lacking in suspense and excitement, as in my opinion the most intense or interesting parts of the film are made light of, making it rather monotonous. The story and the film in general after the first 45 minutes or so became rather boring to the extent I would have got up and left had I been alone. There is no real connection with the characters or the plot and the viewer is left indifferent as to the end result. I found to be meaningless and insincere, and found myself wanting the film to end just so I could leave."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 February 2018,8/10,What a funny crazy violent ride of a film this was...
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 March 2014,8/10,"I love Wes Anderson and his style as an auteur, do not mistake my comments on this film as anything but pure admiration, however if you're not familiar with his style do not go and see it.I remember watching my first ever Wes Anderson film and being in slight bewilderment of what on earth was going on, so when I saw a couple leave the cinema no more than a hour into the film I understood why. Wes Anderson's films are a lot of things, universal is not one of those things. Gut wrenchingly funny is also another phrase that should be avoided when describing a Wes Anderson film to someone unfamiliar with any previous works.Quirky, colourful, unique, well-made, superbly edited and overall mesmerising are all much more appropriate descriptions of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Suspend your disbelief and enter the slightly obscure world that this film exists and you'll find yourself caught up in a thrilling story which you never quite know where it will take you next.A story which in my opinion is far more well-thought out and defined than most previous films by Anderson, something very much welcomed. Also the lack of extremely awkward love stories is quite relieving. Although Ralph Fiennes, M.Gustave, does have what some would call 'odd-relations' so maybe I should retract that comment.One aspect that must be mentioned is the acting, which as usual is without fault. As would be expected from such a cast. What I'm trying to say is if you love Wes then you'll love this fantastical addition to his film collection. The ending however may leave you wanting more but an open ended film leaves space for creativity and imagination so maybe that's a plus after all.Oh Wes, you've done it again"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 June 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best movie I have watched in years! It begins by a very serious introduction from the well spoken author, which is not really relevant to the story itself, but gives an idea of the movie itself - when the author is interrupts by the kids. Every episode in this movie contains/ends with a twist. Every twist will get you to smile. The name and the synapses of the movie is a little misleading; although the story is set originally in Budapest during the war, this is used only as a frame, and less as part of the adventure itself. The same events could take place at another time, at another place. This is not to say that the frame doesn't add to the storyline, it actually gives some beautiful heart-touching aspects. Although it's set at the beginning of the last era, the pace of the movie represents nowadays: fast, nonstop, keeps the watchers interested at all times - not a boring second. This is not the movie you check your phone during. Serious stuff happens there, but nothing is too big for the characters. Oh the characters! So original, so funny, so likable, I wish I could see them again. Each and every one of them, the dead and the living. This movie should get awards for everything: writing, directing, acting, filming, the rest... I was laughing during and crying a little at the end. And I wanted to watch it again. That's what happens in good movies."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 August 2014,1/10,Unfortunately I watched this film from beginning to end and could not believe that people paid good money to make this let alone to watch it. It was utter drivel throughout. The emperors new clothes comes to mind! Do professional film critics of today have no concept of what the ordinary man or woman in the street might actually think? It was thoroughly incomprehensible. The film plot was ridiculous. The acting was weird. I despair that film makers seem to have resorted to this sort of infantile production. Whatever happened to a good story line? Whatever happened to believability? I don't know what else to say other than to advise that if you miss seeing this film you will not be missing anything at all.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,7/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel Follows the story of Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes the concierge of the Grand Budapest hotel and his lobby boy Zero played by Tony Revolori. I takes place at the time they steal a priceless piece art from a dead patron of the Grand Budapest Hotel and are forced to go on the run with plenty of third parties hunting them. The best word i can use to describe the direction of the Grand Budapest hotel by Wes Anderson is meticulous. Everything shot feels well thought out with everything centered to the screen. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a rare original treat for movie goers with an enormous cast and plenty of cameos to go with it. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, and that is probably due to Ralph Fiennes who steals the show as Gustave H in every scene that he is in. There are plenty of humorous moments that made me chuckle in the movie but none that really made me laugh out loud. The movie can feel a little overwhelming at times with a cast of that size when the scenes are generally brief and refer to characters from previous scenes, so keep up! The best thing about this movies though is its originality. At no time during the movie did i know how it would turn out for Gustave and Zero, or anyone else for that matter.Wes Anderson has put together a movie thats a good time at the cinema that doesn't have a dull moment. Go check it out"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 January 2015,8/10,"Although Wes Anderson hasn't had many films in the spotlight he is undoubtedly a very talented filmmaker, which is very evident in The Grand Budapest Hotel. It has all the quirkiness that has become his signature, is very subtly funny and also packs a punch of emotion. I'm not certain it would fall into the comedy category (which it did for the golden globes and has done on IMDb) though, so don't watch it expecting to be in stitches, as I said it is subtle comedy. There was one slight thing that irritated me; the accents of all the actors were different, with many American actors sticking to their American accents, Saoirse Ronan with her Irish accent, and Ralph Fiennes with his English.But obviously this doesn't retract from the film, just a side note, and the beautiful art and soundtrack alone more than make up for it. Overall,it's excellent, and Ralph Fiennes once again shows us his incredible range as an actor, with an impressive debut from Tony Revolori! I would certainly recommend it to anyone that enjoys their films."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 February 2018,10/10,"I love me some Wes Anderson. I'm very biased towards the dude and his work so take everything I say with a grain of salt. The cast is freaking amazing. Ralph Fiennes, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, F. Murray Abraham, and Edward Norton? Sign me the hell up. All of them do great and no one scene is stolen completely by any one actor. The cast isn't the only amazing thing about this movie, the Soundtrack is also great. The Cinematography by Robert Yeoman is a treat for the eyes, as Yeoman has a real skill for the details. I could down the list of all the reasons I love this film, but I don't wanna be that verbose."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 March 2014,4/10,"There were major crowds to see this movie in Scottsdale, AZ. So large were the crowds that I was turned away on my first attempt. Undaunted, I decided to see this movie at the same theater as a Monday matinée. Again, the theater was very crowded.Considering the crowds (and the professional reviews of 8.4) I could not wait to see this film. To my disappointment I found the film to be unfunny and boring. I could not wait for the movie to end. It had the feel of a 1960s Blake Edward's comedy. Think ""The Pink Panther"". Those movies were funny in their day, but not in the 21st century.Unlike Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" there was not one memorable moment. Anderson would be better to come up with a novel concepts rather than attempting to use worn out themes from the 1960's."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 July 2014,10/10,"Camp, pure camp. Wild farce. Nostalgia. Tears, laughter, fear, joy, wonder. You must, you simply must, let this film take you on it's bizarre journey into Europe's past. Accolades are inadequate. It will be watched over and over. And over. Each character is presented with such skill that after only two viewings, I can visualize and describe at least a dozen of them. The plot elements are secondary and are only as the plate is to the wonderful dinner. The story of Old Europe passing away as the war rages all around, can only be told as the people who lived it are shown. Anderson shows them, and makes the viewer feel that he has comprehended their true nature. It is so sad that they are all gone now. The distant past, known to my grandfather. All faded into the pink mist."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 December 2014,8/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a beautiful and magical movie that takes us into a perfectly painted world that looks like a fairytale that only Wes Anderson can create, inside a world torn by a war the perfect duo of Gustave and Zero try to survive and make some money along the way.The colorful characters portrayed by a well chosen cast, all play a part in Gustave's plot to gain what the deserve, a wonderful and funny story that will keep you laughing and will make sure that you will watch every second.The movie may be shorter than the movies we got used to watching but it's an hour and a half you wont regret.hope you will enjoy the movie Tomer A. Spector"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,24 June 2015,9/10,"After the release of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", Wes Anderson continues his work with a similarly excellent film, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". The color palletes in each scene are planned to perfection, coinciding with the costume and set design. The dialogue is as witty as expected. Every scenario is delivered with a corkiness that is lacking in many Hollywood films, seeming almost British at times.Ralph Fiennes is as brilliant as ever in his role of the concierge and leaves you with no option but to cheer him on. At the film's conclusion I hoped it would never end...but sadly...the humor could not be forever :( I've spoken with a few viewers who did not enjoy the film. The unorthodox pace and editing leaves some feeling bored, but anyone who enjoys the art of filmmaking will find this movie as satisfying as can be. If you're looking for a laugh, along with every aspect that makes a film aesthetically pleasing, look no further. Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films to come out in many years."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 May 2015,8/10,"I'd say it is a pretty solid flick, it's one of those movies with style, one of those movies that gets nominated for an Oscar because there is something unique about it, that's how I see this movie, I very much enjoyed it and thought it was a special movie. WATCH IT! like it's a film with heart, and power and the characters are awesome and very weird, the way it was filmed was weird, reminded me of an old stage play or something or one of those grand old Hollywood flicks from the earlier days of cinema. with painted backgrounds etc, acting was very nice, the actors were very likable in their roles, not one of the actors fell flat or went out of character or ruined it, I'd say it might be one of my favourite flicks, most possibly, it's really quite cool, I'd suggest anyone of all ages to watch it, I am 18 years of age and I loved it. you find that many people my age aren't into movies with style but because I have an interest in filmmaking etc I love movies from all genres, I have an appreciation for all kinds of movies, just give it a chance I think! 8/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 January 2016,8/10,"Regarding to the story, Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie about the chase for a very valuable painting called Boy with Apple, which Gustave H., Concierge at the famous Grand Budapest Hotel, inherited. Not important! This movie isn't about a great story, it's about beautiful cinematography, and if it's about a story, it's the history of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Wes Anderson made the right decision, when he decided to underline the different decades by choosing different aspect ratios. It's Wes Anderson at it's best. I also want to highlight the really good cutting. Apart from that the dialogues are brilliant, for example because of the characters quick-witted answers. It definitely deserves it's four Oscars and it should have get even more. Sorry for my bad English"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,10/10,"This was the best film that I have seen in some time. Everything from the beautiful backdrops to the gently funny script kept me riveted from start to finish. There was more plot line than in many of Anderson's earlier films, which probably makes it more accessible to a general audience. The two main characters, Gustave and Zero, had great chemistry which helped push through any points where the story might have lagged. Ralph Fiennes was absolutely cracking, but there wasn't a bad performance from any of the actors in this, of which there were many. Giving bit-parts to everyone you know might seem a bit cheeky, but all the parts fit with the feel of the film. The framing of almost every shot by a pillar or just pretty colour selection made the whole thing fit in a fairytale era, which an old Zero mentions near the end of the film may not have existed for a long time. Though the ending is bitter-sweet I came out of the pictures grinning, and am still in the afterglow. Top notch quirky entertainment. I heartily endorse this product. xxx"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 October 2014,9/10,"Grand Budapest is, without a trace of a doubt, Wes Anderson's crowning jewel, and I believe it will be marked in film history as his trademark piece. The only thing that prevents it from being God in-film-ate is that the length leaves the viewer craving more. As a white person, I can say to all of you that Wes's direction in this movie is at its finest.Don't be fooled by the overstated appearance of the characters and the sets, the classy and pompous sheen is an ironic statement - the plot and moral (if you can call it that) is very true and has a universal appeal to people of all walks of life."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson is one of the most talented and uncommon directors of his generation and in this film he shows that he is he is a very inspirational director. The Film is original and will have you laughing throughout the whole movie and story line is fantastic. The way Wes Anderson can turn such a simple plot into something so unique and wonderfully amazing. The acting in the film is outstanding whoever picked the cast is a genius all the actors are perfect for the characters they play. Ralph Fiennes reminds everyone that he isn't just an evil wizard that has no nose and that he is an actor that can play roles of all characteristics. The character that Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave is fantastic, he loves older women and loves to be a lover, he also is very resourceful getting himself out of the most horrendous and daunting situations. Tony Revolori plays Zero a lobby boy which I couldn't imagine being played by anyone else, the way he played this awkward and determined lobby boy was absolutely outstanding. He was perfect for the role. I can see many Academy Award Nominations coming towards this movie and hopefully Ralph Fiennes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 March 2014,7/10,"I can fully understand that Anderson's overdecorated, overstylized and highly self-conscious movies aren't for everyone, but at least some of the criticism rests on a faulty philosophical or aesthetic footing. Do movies made in a more naturalistic mode, like mainstream comedies and dramas with their formulaic three-act plots, actually do a better job of reproducing human relationships or social reality? What about movies set in outrageously artificial universes, like action films or thrillers, where we simply agree to overlook the fact that everything that happens is wildly implausible? To move the question to a larger frame, since when are the movies supposed to create a convincing simulacrum of reality? American cinema, which remains the medium's dominant model, hardly ever does and hardly ever has."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 March 2014,10/10,"I was blown away by the mise-en-scene and composition of the different shots in this film. Almost every frame can be frozen, printed out and hung on the wall in your living room. The colors, the balance, the compositions, everything visually just made this film magical to me. This was definitely what impressed me most, not because the film was lacking in other areas but because it is so rare to literally have such a beautiful picture.The story was clever and engaging with unique characters who we immediately like (even the villains, particularly Willem Dafoe who got uproarious laughter from me, as well as the spectators around me in the cinema).The quirky, fantasy world Anderson has created with the Grand Budapest provides a welcomed escape at a time when many of the films on screen depict true stories.I enjoyed every minute of this picture. Not only was I pulled into Anderson's fantastic universe, I laughed out loud many times and left the theater happy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2014,10/10,"IN SHORT: Don't watch the trailers and just go see this film.IN LONG: Wes Anderson truly can do no wrong. This movie boasts the same unique style as all of his other films and it is completed by the ever- amazing cast of recurring actors in their constantly refreshing roles.On a side note; if you can help it DO NOT watch the trailers. As is standard with Hollywood style trailers they give away some of the best punchlines out of their context, and going into the movie without watching them will undoubtedly make it more enjoyable. After watching the initial trailer I was a bit sceptical on a couple things but the film ended up dispelling my fears.First the relationship between Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. Not much to say other than that they give a stellar performance.Secondly, on a kind of nit-picky point, I was curious to see why Anderson chose to sacrifice widescreen for 4:3 and I was worried this would take away from his typical cinematography. It doesn't, in fact it helps to clarify a slightly complex story.See this while it is in theatres. You won't regret it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2014,10/10,"This movie has it all. Photography is such that each shot could hang on your wall as piece of art. The acting is impressive, especially by Raph Fiennes and Toni Revolori. And what a star-studded cast indeed. I love the sense of nostalgia in the movie, leaving a feeling of great happiness even in the darker moments of the movie. The story is built up very clever and is at times hilarious. Set-design is perfect into every detail. Last but not least the music is pulling it all together into a Masterpiece! This movie in so very inspirational, even more so than Moonrise Kingdom. It leaves you with abundant creative energy. Definitely worth watching again and again. Can't wait to see Wes Anderson next productions."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 June 2014,3/10,"The film is listed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. The entire film was one or two funny scenes. An interesting drama, and not a complete waste of time, but still a disappointment. I do not understand why this movie has such high ratings. I looked at the descriptions of other users who have described this movie brilliant, perfect for stay at home, absurd, amusing, violent, simply beautiful and so on. Frankly, none of that I have not seen. I saw a couple of famous actors and I was expecting a lot more. The biggest disappointment brings it I expected a good comedy with a good rating from users here and looked mediocre drama."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 July 2014,3/10,"The Grand Budapest features a drab storyline, wrought from the dullest fairy tales. The cast is of a magnificent blend, but their name alone is the upside. They make minute appearances, lasting no longer than several minutes in length, and as noted earlier, manipulated in an unfavorable way by the director- casting their acting skills to the toilet. The three stars I do grant this movie comes from the performances given by Ralph Fiennes, and an honorable mention to Tony Revolori. Ralph Fiennes commands the screen, drawing the illusion that he truly was a concierge in the 1960's.The director makes use of novice camera tricks, and the movie has the feel of a parody the likes of which has been seen in Monty Python, and Weird Al Yankovic music videos. This is not a notable movie, and a tremendous letdown by the ratings from IMDb, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, it really should be titled The Grand, Blandest."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 January 2015,10/10,"What I loved most about this film was its quirky nature-it felt almost like I was being read a book and this was what my imagination was seeing. The storyline was cleverly put and I loved how it occasionally switched from present day to the main storyline. The poetry was an interesting touch, although I found it remarkably funny how the swearing just popped up every now and then, adding an altogether different twist to the film. Whilst I don't wish to spoil anything for others reading this review that have yet to watch the film, I think that the combination of mystery, slight romance and fast-pace led to an altogether unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. A brilliant storyline and a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 August 2014,10/10,If Wes Anderson hadn't already mastered the art of captivating the hearts and minds of all who see his fill a then he hits the mark here. This film takes you into a world so much like your own with characters so different to anyone you've ever met. Yet somehow you can relate to those characters in a deep way that leaves you wanting the movie to never end. Through the ins and outs of different characters you go through romance to drama to comedy. Never was I left bored. The best part was you are left on the edge of your seat until the end of the movie when everything becomes clear. Never have I seen such a masterpiece. From the great actors to the amazing script I would see this movie a million times. So please when you get the chance see why Wes Anderson is possibly the most brilliant director of our time.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 September 2014,10/10,"If you like escapism, with a capital 'E', you will love this other-worldly movie. Pure joy from start to finish, it is delicious cinematic perfection and one of the most entertaining movie experiences that I've had in years. Beautifully shot like an adult fairy-tale, this is truly creative story-telling at it's absolute finest. The highly skilled outstanding performances from the entire cast and the director Wes Anderson are all Oscar worthy. I never really ""got"" Ralph Fiennes before, but now I get him, his comedic timing is note perfect. A hilarious and wickedly lovable adventure, this movie is a joy to watch, an epic feast for the eyes. It's refreshing and gorgeous, so do yourself a favour - go see it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 September 2014,10/10,"This is Wes Anderson's latest and greatest! I'm a big fan of Anderson, and this movie blew me away! The sets of this movie is gorgeous, the acting is phenomenal! And most of all the use of colors and direction is amazing! My god, this is probably the best movie of the year! Must be nominated for Oscars! Nobody makes movies quite like Wes Anderson, this is extremely Unique, and very good at it! It keeps you interested, and is told very well with dialogue and even some violence. All in all this is one of my favorite films of all time! My only problem is I can't find a problem! Seriously! The one flaw I can think of is when it ends! I won't spoil anything for you just watch it! Especially for the first time, that's and adventure in its self, I remember i started watching it at midnight and stayed up all night just to watch it, it' that intriguing!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 April 2018,9/10,"Every moment of this is fantastic. All of the characters have something special about themselves. Whether it's Dmitri and his gang who are quite frightening. Mr. Gustave who steals every scene he's in, or Zero who's awkwardness makes him a great suppor to Gustave and even better when he's on his own. They all come together to form one truly unforgettable and entertaining film that will be a classic in the years to come."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 February 2015,3/10,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is the most overrated, contrived and pretentious movie I've see in a long time. The audience is supposed to love it because it is a welcome break from those horrible cgi sci-fi movies, explosions, blood an gore epics and insipid romcoms that are about all Hollyword produces anymore. Sorry, this isn't much better. It is predictable that the artsy crowd would fall in love with it, since it is calculated to appeal to them. Anderson has it screaming ""Look at me, I'm an artiste!!"" in every frame.Of course, it didn't help that it starred one of my least favorite actors Ralph. Fiennes. I swear, one these days he's going to win a best actress Oscar."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 February 2015,,"The Grand Budapest Hotel was by far the most pretentious, non- imaginative script written piece of garbage I have ever watched.In your face exceedingly so throughout the film is the attempt at diverse slow motion and shoddy camera angle which seem to chase there tale throughout the entirety of this film.It tries to be so stylish overly so that you get tired of viewing extremely colorful film set's to the point of scratching out your eyes which would be a relief, if I wanted to take LSD I would have gone out to buy some. Next the script is barely non-existent again struggling, to be anything more than something you watch when you get home from work, to turn your brain off to, if it were on you most likely would lose some brain cells to this dribble its as if the director is playing on his past contributions to the film industry and hoping for die hard fans to give it the thumbs up, basically presuming everyone else will follow suit. Honestly don't make the mistake of losing two hours of your life watching this film and when I say film only because they wasted the film to make this garbage. The only saving grace is the cast which all take minuscule roles, not fulfilling their actual acting potential and leave a hole in your gut wanting more but never receiving it in an utter lack of disappointment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 February 2015,8/10,"This quirky, fast paced, and colourful adventure follows Gustave. H and his protégé bellboy Zero through a world of wonder and war. Though a very short film, is packed with many faced paced scenes, it is impossible to be bored. The quirky music plays very well with the attitude and mood of the film. The cast is full of flavourful and famous faces, and they all shine no matter how big the part. If you're looking for a bizarre, unusual film, this is it. While some of the motives behind the film's theme are unclear, it is impossible not to fall in love with the haunting yet beautiful story that Wes Anderson has portrayed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 March 2015,9/10,"I get a little annoyed with the people who rate this movie below 8.Yes, critics tend to over hype its kind and the style has been experienced in Andersons previous movies but how can anyone not acknowledge the sheer brilliance of it. How often are we fortunate to see such a high level of acting, dialogue and of course cinematography. The beginning is a little slow but as soon as we are in the 1930s it really takes off and there is no major flaw to find throughout the movie, its just really satisfying to watch. I am also often guilty of writing off movies as pretentious but this one is just simply great, period! (or exclamation mark in this case)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 July 2015,9/10,"First I have to admit that I picked out this movie randomly, without knowledge of its starring and producing year.So as It began, I didn't expected such a film. You know what I mean. Funny that I actually thought it was produced about 10 years ago, so when Ralph Fiennes first showed up, I though it maybe his brother or somebody else. And the very appearance of Jude Law only made me think ""Man, did he look this old back then?"" However, I consulted Internet and read some reviews before I continued. To grasp the whole picture. So I understand that it is very well made, with its structure and symmetrical cine-frame and humour. However there are also reviews claiming its emptiness, saying that it actually did not convey anything concrete.From my perspective, this film has meanings, maybe too much and too opaque, too many metaphors that I cannot understand."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 November 2018,8/10,Another feeling. Another thoughts. Development of imagination. Development of imagination.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 October 2018,9/10,"In my opinion this is Wes Anderson's finest work as a whole. From the use of colors and symmetry every shot is pleasant to the eye and entertaining to watch. The dialog is witty charming and engaging. Fiennes does exceptional as his role as the concierge with an all star supporting cast including Murray, Willis, and Norton adding even more to an already great movie. Overall a 9/10 and in my personal top 10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 May 2016,10/10,"I really liked this movie! Every shot was piece of art and I love it. Story was told a very unique, lovely way.The storyline was very pleasant experience. Story was told with sense and it was understandable and clear. Speech was very clear and understandable with my poor English skills.The thing that I liked the most - was way to shoot the video shots. Shots was always kind of ordered and the main thing was placed center or satisfying position. There was some kind of standard made for parts where story was told.I can way 10, because this was first movie - what gave me reason for leaving a review.Thank you! I love this movie - I can recommend it for almost everyone!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 May 2020,,"The movie is a real howler. I mean, it is so outrageously funny that it borders on absurd. An excellent performance from Ralph Fiennes, I didn't know he had such comedy genius in him!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 September 2021,9/10,"Like the wonderful picture in the movie, the events of this movie are no less amazing and beautiful than it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 August 2018,10/10,"I have just watched the Grand Budapest Hotel (and grand it is, indeed) for the first time and I was wowed beyond expectation. I must admit that I do take prior IMDb ratings into account before watching a movie and I was impressed by this film's high appraisal. Also keeping in mind the noise made by this movie a few years ago at the Oscars, I entered this movie with quite high expectations. This film is nicely paced, and instantly I was put into a trance by the beautifully designed set. I must give credit to Anna Pinnock and Adam Stauckhausen, they rightfully deserved the Academy award for production design on this film. This film is simply beautiful to the eye. This aspect is nicely complimented by the intricate and aesthetically pleasing costume design. The star-studded cast definitely positively impacted my experience. I appreciated the smaller roles played by A-list actors such as Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (Wes Anderson regulars) and others including Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton. The acting in this movie is stellar, especially considering that this type of film/performance is not often seen by mainstream present-day audiences. This is not necessarily your run-of-the-mill movie, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing. Although not typical, I would say most movie-going audiences would enjoy this film as I did. The Grand Budapest Hotel balances just the perfect amount of bizarreness, creativity, sentimentality, independency, and story-telling ability to craft a one of a kind piece that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 January 2017,9/10,"Well, there is not much left to say after seeing this amazing picture but that i regret not to have seen it earlier. The way this story is brought to the viewer is in my opinion, brilliant. The fact as it is not presented to you in a deeply realistic way, i by this i mean that this movie has a very marked caricature way in its characterization, image, speeches and even narrative. Gives you the constant same feeling you get of you reading a book, as you imagine the scenes, the places, the light everything. And i think that shows what a great job the Wes Anderson did giving you this brilliant film. With nothing else to say i advise everyone to see this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 June 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those rare gems ~ visually stunning, fabulous narrative and flawless characterization - oh and the sounds! in my opinion a perfect film. I have never taken the time before to write a review. I am doing so for this film.It will win Oscars. Everything about this film is an experience of light and sound and storytelling. It is magnificent.It is not fair for me to try and point out who is in it and who says what. just watch the movie. it's amazing. If you have just seen it and like me don't check IMDb until after I have watched - then I am quite sure you agree with me.if you are the person who checks IMDb before watching a film - then you are in for a wonderful ride. enjoy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 November 2017,10/10,"This film is like spending an hour and a half in your grandparent's attic. It takes our romantic understandings of the era to create a hyper-exaggerated version of reality, that is only possible if we take the things that don't matter too seriously, and ridicule the grandiose. Despite its rather unimaginative plot, the setting only emphasizes its dry humour and lively camera-work. A real joy to watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 January 2018,1/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel tries hard to be charming, mysterious, funny and dramatic at the same time but doesn't quite achieve the goal. Plainly, it's just an ensemble of American stereotypes of ,,europeanness'' all put together in one pot. A bit more accuracy (like Tarantino) could have helped. Instead, there are tons of references to historical events, all slightly altered and often very randomly put together. 
In addition to that, there's a lot of completely unnecessary violence. As for the ,,funny'' scenes - I didn't laugh once. Maybe, if you're not familiar with European history and don't mind the completely random mixing of historical references (and accents) you might enjoy this movie - otherwise it's a complete failure.What a waste of a good plot!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2018,7/10,"I totally understand some people find this movie boring, shallow, pretentious, all style and no substance etc. I'm not a huge fan of Wes Anderson and would have felt the same if it had not for one outstanding factor: Ralph Fiennes. He is spectacular here. I never thought he had so much comedic chop in him. He carries the whole movie almost single-handed, perfectly playing the haughty and suave but hopelessly insecure and lonely concierge. Forget other stellar cast, who play more or less cardboard cliche characters. Forget cinematography and production design, which are very pretty but unrealistic. For me this film was worth watching because of the amazing performance by the lead actor. I have to add that young Tony Revolori as the lobby boy was equally great. Together, the two make one of the best ""buddies"" in movies I've seen in recent years."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 December 2019,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie filled with adventure, action, mystery and love. The movie focuses around two main characters M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy Zero Moustafe (Tony Revolori) and their adventures together and how they solved their problem. While watching the movie you may notice that the key theme through-out the film is loyalty. Wes Anderson (The Director) did an amazing job capturing this theme and presenting it in such a fun and entertaining way with his choice on angles and lighting.
While watching the movie unfold you cannot help but notice the lack of space on screen. Wes Anderson makes sure, in an intentional way, that everything on screen is being used and applied to the whole story of the movie. If you a seeing something happen in the background it is because Wes Anderson wants you to see and notice the event. The angles of The Grand Budapest are rather simple and straight forward but, executed in a brilliant way that does not interfere with the film or distract the viewer with too much. Most of the scenes are filmed head on to Gustave and Zero hiding most of the background or focusing on the main points of the story but, some scenes like the jail break scene intentionally use a different angle to show what is happening. It does not pull from the story it does not ruin the scene and it is fairly subtle and that is the genius of the angles in the movie. As for applying this technique to the theme of loyalty it is done with quite skill. Using the head on filming just the two Gustave and Zero it really helps build their bond for the viewer. We get to see them from the beginning where Gustave does not trust Zero as much it is filmed showing mostly their whole bodies. When we realize the theme of loyalty is when the film is showing the two closer together and more of their upper bodies and faces. That is really when we the viewer become engulfed in the fact that Zero would do anything for Gustave and vise-versa.
The Grand Budapest is filmed with a unique lighting that helps us the viewer know what to feel. At the beginning of film it hotel is dark and almost has a sad fog in it but, when Mr. Mustafe (F. Murray Abraham) is recollecting his journey with M. Gustave the hotel is very well lit and has a joyous feel to it. This lighting technique is used in practically every scene, if we are supposed to feel sad or disappointed then Wes Anderson made sure that the scene was darker and gloomier. This technique can also help enforce the theme in a simplistic but, very well done way: when Gustave and Zero are together the scene is brighter more happy feeling and when they are separated it is darker and gloomier. Eventually, Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is introduced and she becomes loyal to Zero and when they are together the scene is brighter as well. Ralph Fiennes is no stranger to the lighting technique and a theme of loyalty. However, he is known for the dark lighting playing the bad guy, Lord Voldemort, in what could be his most famous movies; the Harry Potter films. The Harry Potter films share a common lighting style of darkness is sad and light means happiness the films also have a loyalty theme through-out all of them."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 December 2020,1/10,One of the most overrated movies in the entire history
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 June 2015,4/10,"I had great hopes for this film, I liked the previous titles of the director, and mostly, find him imaginative and cheerful. Also, this film featured a lot of good actors, and even Bill Murray!.But it falls short, it's not really funny. There are a lot of dialogs, that try to be fast and brilliant, but they get tiring after a while. There are a bunch of repetitive jokes, that are not funny. I was really expecting to laugh, and you know that feeling when you are trying to laugh on a film, but it doesn't deliver. Seems like the visuals, while powerful, were meant to be the main part of the comedy. But they don't really add a sense of comedy. Not even the hotel is an important piece of the history. Maybe I was expecting it to be a comedy, but that was not the intention of the director?And then, the just mere circumstantial appearance of Mr Murray."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 November 2021,1/10,"Nothing ever happens. There are pleny of things going on the screen, but this movie is void of any fun or meaning or vit. It's just boring and tiresome to watch."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 May 2019,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is like fantasy, adventure, visual art, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup all distilled into one rollercoaster of an experience that leaves you with the feeling of waking up from a dream you wish you could return to. Wes Anderson is known for his cinematography and quirky stories, and whether you've been a Wes Anderson fan for years, or you're new to his work, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a solid pick.
The plot of the film revolves around Gustav H. (Ralph Fiennes), the head concierge at a very high-class hotel in the 1930's. The story is told from the perspective of Zero (Tony Revolori), a young refugee that is hired by Gustav as a lobby boy. After an elderly guest of the hotel meets her untimely demise, she wills a priceless painting to Gustav. Then begins a whirlwind of drama between the children of the women led by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), Gustav, and Zero as they try to track down a secret will and try to avoid being murdered by Dmitri's hired thug.
The story is exceptional, and a blast to watch unfurl for every second of the 110-minute runtime, but what makes The Grand Budapest Hotel truly unique amongst a sea of delightful and satisfying films is its cinematography. Many of the wide-angle shots in the movie, believe it or not, were created using sets built with miniature models, and then stylized further in post-editing. This type of set design and cinematography gives The Grand Budapest Hotel a truly exclusive feeling of warmth and surrealism.
When you put all the elements of the film together, though, it left me with a profound feeling of loss. It was a strange feeling to have after watching what had chiseled its way into my top three favorite movies of all time. A feeling like I may never again enjoy a movie like the one's which credits I was seeing scroll by. Then it hit me, while the shots were beautiful, the comedy sharp, and the PG-13 action was top notch, the whole story was really a story of loss.
The loss of a different time, further described by the opening shot in which a girl brings a book to a statue, in an obviously muted world. Then that statue is revealed to be an author, who wrote the story of Zero. These separate layers of storytelling ingrain the feeling that while you, the viewer, are experiencing the grandeur of Gustav H., its beauty, class, and wonder is firmly in the past, never to be experienced firsthand again. I felt the loss most painfully when the author was speaking to Zero in the time-scorched Grand Budapest that I'd learned to love, and listening to him regale losing Agatha, and losing Gustav. It was then, that I felt the true loss that The Grand Budapest is portraying.
A quote from Gustav, ""You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."". Through the movie we come to know that Gustav represents this faint glimmer, and then we are forced to realized that faint glimmer that makes up every one of the many warm feelings stirred when watching the film, went out along with him. That made me feel a loss that I will carry with me for some time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 April 2019,,"No scene in this film looked good. I don't know who chose the set, pure and simply the cinematography was grotesque - It was in fact like watching a horror film, that bad it looked. The characters were empty from the inside and psychotic. They were like moving aimlessly in a pile of trash. What was the point of the first scene when we are introduced in the so called technique of story within a story? Maybe, to show the decadence of a once thriving hotel? When did that hotel look good? The plot had no logic and told no story. No real enemy was present. And that hotel guy whose name is totally forgettable has a machiavellian personality, and his servant is his lap dog with a face that shows no spark of life. No character in this film has any sign of intelligence and nothing made any sense."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 May 2019,7/10,"While the film had a certain aesthetic and dialogue that would, in my opinion, define and qualify it as art, it just lacked any real entertainment - watching it would be like admiring art in a museum, not watching a film.
Its culmination was disappointing and the film didn't get my attention at any point of the film. It seemed to lack depth.
Still, it made for good art and was overall a very unique and somewhat intriguing concept."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 October 2018,10/10,"A brilliantly written and acted film. Funny, witty, and beautiful rich viewing. Absolutely star studded and worth every single cameo within."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 May 2019,1/10,"This is the first Wes Anderson movie I've ever watched, and given it's supposed to be its masterpiece, I think it will be the last one. In fact, I could just stand to watch half of it, and decided it wasn't worth wasting the rest of my time so just read the rest of the argument.When I watch a movie, I wanted to have some emotion behind it, and to teach me something. The reason why didn't like this movie (and probably, Wes Anderson's particular style) is that I felt there was nothing in it besides its visuals, this perfectionist shots and stiff way of acting. All the scenes look alike, and all actors act in the same way: stiff, inexpressive. It didn't seem funny to me at any point.Even if the plot made up for it (which is based on a book by Zweig), the execution of the film just spoils it. This very plastic, very materialistic outlook of the movie, with an obsession with this beautiful visuals, just seems a way for the author to conceal the shallowness of the movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 September 2019,9/10,"Funny, suspenseful, exciting and full of amazing performances with great direction and utterly original story, The Grand Budapest Hotel is an amazing way to spend 100 minutes. Rating: A"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 June 2019,10/10,This has perfect cinematography and is extremely funny at times and is a tear jerker at others.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 August 2021,10/10,"Wes Anderson is a great director and this movies is his best, the cast, the story and storytelling, the score, the directing, the cinematography and the all other film making materials are perfectly done."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2020,10/10,"While this is for school to get extra credit, i enjoyed writing this review and this movie.
Wes Anderson's off key writing and directing creates a wall between those who like his movies, and those who don't. I am part of the group that adores his movies. However in the turn of the 2000s, his directing took a more ominous turn. Instead of a cute and pretty style, it turned unhuman, harshly colourful, and unappealing to some. However when mixing together all the weird cameras, actors, and story it creates the wonderful The Grand Budapest Hotel.The Story seems to be rather mundane compared to high actionpacked movies, even if I summarize the movie it would seem boring and slow. I agree, the plot is rather boring. Through my first watch-through it felt like a 2 hour movie. But I was charmed by the quirky colours, camera, and writing. The acting brings out the joy and antics of the movie. Paired with beautiful cinematography, lovely colours and environments.My favourite part of any Wes Andersn directed film is the disconcerting acting. The way they talk and move almost seems inhumane, but still conveys the emotion, and deep connections of human nature. While unusual, and often disliked by some. The charming nature of the speech and emotions of character allows you to form connections, even in a fleeting movie. Zero is by far my favourite character, his quirky yet passion for his friends shows through the whole movie. To explain Zero's character in a word, I'd say dedication.While Wes Anderson's movies contain subtle 'political' commentary, The Grandbudapest Hotel contains a more prevalent one. Zero came from a town that was taken over by fascists, and fled in search of a home. Acceptance, solace in a world of chaos, is the moral of the movie, and the beautiful relationship between Zero and Gustave tears at the heart of everyone, even if they didnt love the movie. ""His world had vanished long before he ever entered it, but he certainly sustained the illusion with a remarkable grace.""While the acting is my favourite part, the cinematography is beautiful. With vivid colours, wonderful environments, and beautiful shots there isn't anything bad I can say about it. The best thing I can say is, watch this movie. If not for the actors, story, commentary, watch it for the wonderful artistry of the camera.
My favorite scene can be watched spoiler free. It contains the wonderful quirky-ness, fun editing, camera, everything I loved.
My Favorite Scene
However the movie did not contain many women. None of them are main characters, and usually the women are played for jokes, such as Gustave's many older women lovers. The exception to this is the baker's girl, Agatha, who was just a love interest of Zero. This is my only complaint, and I wish there could have been more women prominent.If you can't tell, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of my favorite movies. At the end of this overly positive review, I rated it 10/10."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 July 2020,10/10,"Throughout the movie, I felt how happy it was to be with great actors. It feels like I'm eating hot and delicious rice soup after a long time. The satiety drew a smile around my mouth."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2020,9/10,"From the incredible camerawork to the great colour choice, every frame in this film was well thought out and put together in a meaningful way. Great comedic film with a nice story."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 November 2020,10/10,"I absolutely loved the movie, it was a wonderfull story with a well excecuted movie around it. Its different in a sence that the movie feels incredibly playfull yet mature in the same way. Lovely acting. And mostly of all i incredibly enjoyed the atmosphere this film was setting. To me personally it is a definite 10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 August 2020,10/10,"I came to watch this movie because of Saoirse Ronan. Never have I set any expectation on this except to see Saoirse Ronan. But oh boy this movie takes you to the edge of your seat in its own way.It's filled with diverse colors which metaphorically takes you to vast experience, action and adventure. It's vintage style adds more appeal to its delivery.A murder mystery film that never takes away the suspense when it's fun or the other way around but instead it gives more than what is necessary"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 May 2021,9/10,The nudity is very unnecessary but the res is great.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 September 2020,9/10,"It was very colorful and visually appealing movie with so many great shots. Although i even laughed several times, there was lots of violence which made me uncomfortable."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 January 2021,10/10,"Everything about this movie is stunning! Story, sets , cast, and the cinematography is incredible."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 January 2021,1/10,Just go and sleep or read or do something else than watching this hyped movie.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 April 2014,,"'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is truly worth a trip to the cinema. Watch it without expectations and you will most likely have a great time. I haven't been excited enough about a film to write a review before.Both charming and beautifully made, this movie delivers on the potential Wes Anderson's others have hinted at. The visuals were exquisite and the music a seamless accompaniment. The combined effect was a beautiful world that I found to be a lot of fun. It's probably best to watch a movie like this knowing and expecting little.You may not be as impressed and disarmed as I was, but you will probably leave the cinema smiling, like all the people I saw today. I hope my enthusiasm is contagious enough for you to give this movie a proper chance. Thanks."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 January 2021,10/10,"I never thought I'd like this movie but it's charm, wit and dry humor won me over. Absolutely a wonderful gem"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 March 2021,10/10,"From the story to the acting, from the cinematography to the score nothing is forgotten it's a perfect picture"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 April 2021,8/10,Big houss 10/10. Very muc like tha big hous. Dso scool with tha actors omg theyre are actors on da hous.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 April 2014,1/10,"The trailer for this film enticed me to see it. The film was, however, a total let-down and may well be the worst film I have ever seen.The plot was almost non-existent. It certainly had no sense nor direction.The film rambled through a series of mostly boring events punctuated by a liberal dose of expletives that added nothing whatsoever to any aspect of the film except to place it in the smut and filth category.The author must have been high on something when he wrote this one. Unfortunately whatever high he was on, did nothing to make this film worth viewing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 October 2021,9/10,"While I personally found the story per se to be nothing special, the characters and cinematography definately are. This movie was very entertaining and beautifully crafted. The very unique characters and cinematography as well as the great dialogue and narration make a special and beautiful film worth watching out of a decent plot."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 September 2021,10/10,"An utter delight of a film that I continue to revisit on a regular basis. It might actually be Wes Anderson's best movie, which is saying quite a lot."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 September 2021,10/10,"This is my favorite movie of all time. It's a quirky, funny, well-written, well-acted, well-shot, absurd masterpiece. This movie is like watching a painting. The beautiful scenery contrasted with the violence and absurdity of the characters makes it unlike anything I think we will ever see again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2014,1/10,"This movie made GIGLI look like an Oscar contender. What on Earth was this movie about? It was a disaster from the get-go, the first 15-20 minutes were so boring, so awful, people were talking saying, ""is this the right movie?"" The movie does not really do a great job with anything. The fact that the main character looks nothing like his older counterpart later on aside, there is just utter nonsense here.Laughs: maybe 2-3 outloud laughs. Whoever is rating this over a 3 needs to have their head examined. Maybe they were pumping laughing gas into your theatre for you to write a positive review.The scenery is about the best part of the movie and even half of that is fake Hollywood green screen. This was akin to taking $20 of my money and throwing it out the window on the highway. Strike that, actually that would have been BETTER than watching this abomination of a movie.Whoever approved producing this? FIRE THEM Bill Murray? Yeah, just a pay day for his 5 minutes on screen. Don't expect to see him much. And when he does show, there is no explanation for who he is or why he is even there.There are so many side stories to the main story it gets bogged down in boredom. I would say that of the 50-75 people who saw this nightmare with me, 95% left saying ""what the H@#$ was that!"" when leaving.If you are reading this, do not see this movie, do not rent it, do not read positive reviews because they are lies. This is not something that can be remotely seen as a good movie on any angle.If you want to waste 2 hours of your heartbeats on junk, this is for you. Otherwise, see ANYTHING else. See NOAH twice. See CAPTAIN America or ROBOCOB 3x before seeing this once."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 April 2014,9/10,"In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" director Wes Anderson creates a fictional Central European world of his own. Just like the house in the Tennenbaums every aspect of this world really is a marvel on screen. The hotel, the prison, the wonderful characters and the slapstick comedy. Each shot resembles the same aesthetic qualities of the Mendl's pastry. The monastery and subsequent ski chase scenes- also great work by A. Desplat- stand out and are just marvelous. Some have criticized the film because "" though very stylish it has no story, nor 'real characters' underneath"". This is simply not true. The Grand Budapest is a beautiful homage to the works and life of the Austrian - or should I say European- writer Stefan Zweig. Just like Zweig, Gustave H.- a sublime R. Phiennes- has become somewhat of an anachronism in an increasingly changing world. A world where the brutality of the ZZ get's the upper hand. But M. Gustave is a man of principle he refuses to fold which ultimately leads to his death. A 'destiny' he shares with the admirable S. Zweig. This story drives the film and is all but superficial.PS: For those who can't get enough of Mr. Gustave, I recommend reading 'Felix Krull' by the wonderful German writer Thomas Mann (a friend of S.Zweig). The main character (Felix) is very reminiscent of M. Gustave. Actually with a bit of imagination Mann's Felix Krull could well be a 'prequel' to the Gustave H.character in 'the Grand Budapest Hotel'."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 April 2014,1/10,"What a waste of time and money. A cartoon type of film. Actor dialogue was rapid pace and hard to follow at times. It appeared to me that there was a lot of models used in lieu of locations. Went with another couple who were really upset since I based my recommendation of seeing this movie on comments made by reviewers. One seldom heard any laughter in the theater and when you did, it seemed contrived. The film attempted to capture the 1920 film making style but truly missed the mark. I saw some reviews liken the film to Around the World but it was not even close in capturing that flavor.Better off staying away from this dull piece of work. I think the producers must have paid a lot of folks to submit reviews because I really can't believe so many saw value in this corny flick."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 May 2014,10/10,"First off, let me say this. Wes Anderson continues to amaze me with his off-beat, odd, and yet incredibly charming characters and dialogue. I really didn't get his sense of humor until I saw Moonrise Kindgom and rewatched Bottle Rocket. After that it just sort of clicked in my head and have really gone back and enjoyed his films.This is something that really stands out to me, but you might not get it or might not find it important. There is something to be said about a director/writer whose movies can be referred to as ""films"" or ""works"". For example, I would never refer to a Michael Bay movie as a ""film"". Something about calling it that would give it too much credit.And this is a film to remember. One of those works you hope to see on top 100 lists for years to come, or you hope to read, years from now on a blog, people arguing whether or not its actually funny. But in its own quirky, goofy, Wes-Anderson-Way, this movie charms the viewer, has you laughing with and loving the characters, and creates this sense of wonder with the relationship of the two main characters, played by Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. You get to experience young love, feel the thrill of adventure, root for good versus evil, all of which keep a smile on your face the whole time.The whole gang of Wes Anderson Alumni join the cast with countless cameos so keep your eyes open.By the end of the film, you will remember why you loved Ralph Fiennes as an actor, you will have high hopes for Tony Revolori to have his career take off, you will want to travel to Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, you will want to be in Wes Anderson's next film, and you will want to grab a beer with Wes Anderson, because he is surely not a boring human being.All in all a great movie, my favorite Wes Anderson piece, and I hope to see more from him very soon."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 April 2014,10/10,"It appears that Wes Anderson is the director that a-list actors from all genres and discipline are waiting to work with. Here, again, Anderson has evoked hilarity, pity, empathy, hatred, love and pure profundity from the endearing, warmest scenes to the most odd to mildly violent of scenes. Combining actors into one project whom you could not have imagined would ever work together (Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, F. Murray Abraham). I didn't find a single sin committed in the continuity department (perhaps some difficult to find instances are likely to be there, even in an Anderson film). Art direction: Superb, Script/dialog: a joy. Comedic factor: Always present. Suspense: Perfectly executed. The Grand Budapest Hotel is as good as it gets in terms of pure film-making for the love of making a film. Good enough to not be forgotten in a year when the Oscars return in 2015. Wes Anderson may not win best director or Grand Budapest Hotel may not garner Best Picture. But I know there's a ""best"" in this film. Anderson will win, it's only a matter of waiting until Hollywood has decided that he's earned his chops.Please go pay to see and support the cast a crew that worked so hard to create a beautiful film that will no doubt stand the test of time and continue to be watched for decades to come."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 December 2014,10/10,"Fun, is the word I think best describes The Grand Budapest Hotel. From beginning to end this movie will have you grinning like an idiot. Wes Anderson has managed to capture a sense of adventure and lightheartedness that only he can manage.The performances are fantastic with Ralph Fiennes and the relatively unknown Tony Revolori standing out from the pack, they're chemistry helps drives the majority of the film and thanks great writing there is never a dull moment between them.If you have seen a Wes Anderson movie you know what you are getting into with The Grand Budapest Hotel, if you haven't however, you can still enjoy this movie immensely.Easily one of the best movies of 2014 and if you are like me, it may just be one of the best of the decade."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, written and directed by Wes Anderson, has been one of the most delightful movies I have seen in the last few years. It is hilarious, beautiful, violent and features a huge cast of incredible talent including Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, and many other brilliant performances from lesser known actors.It centers around the legendary concierge M. Gustave H. played by Fiennes, who served the Grand Hotel between the two world wars, all told through the perspective of his trusted lobby boy, played by newcomer Tony Revolori. M. Gustave is a personification of high level service, schooling the young Zero in the art of understanding what a guest wants, owning few possessions save for a perfume called ""Eau de Panache"" and a large collection of romantic poetry which is he quick to quote even in the most dire of circumstances. The whole movie is centered around the illusion that Mr. Gustave maintains and without it the whole thing would collapse.Presenting itself as a story within a story, the movie jumps back to the eighties, to the sixties and finally to the late thirties, where the story of a romantic living in a cynical era takes place. The main story surrounding Mr. Gustave and his lobby boy Zero moves fast and takes the characters to perfectly framed and constructed setting after setting, each looking like a new page in a pop up book. It's full of humor, sped up chase scenes, gunfights, a prison break and hilariously fake special effects, all meant to makes the events look increasingly ridiculous. However, just underneath the surface is a very dark and melancholy reality. The political landscape of the 1930's Europe is sliding closer and closer to war as a Fascist power becomes increasingly present. The scenes where Zero and Mr. Gustave are alone show his illusion fade away as he shows how aware he is of the world around him changing. The country that The Grand Budapest exists in is about to experience war, Fascism, the Holocaust, only to be followed by decades of Communist totalitarianism. Wes Anderson has always attempted to capture emotions that are seldom explored in other movies to the depths that he manages. In The Grand Budapest Hotel, the feeling is one of nostalgia. It takes place in the past but not the historical past. It manages to present a beautiful and ideal time that as one of the characters describes, ""probably never existed"". My rating: 10 out of 10. Take the time to see this movie, you won't regret it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 September 2014,8/10,"If you're already a fan of director Wes Anderson going into this film you'll enjoy it without a shadow of a doubt. The Grand Budapest Hotel lays on the usual Wes Anderson trademarks that we all love with the symmetrical shots, the old fashioned style of effects, the visually beautiful display of colour, the large A-list cast and the witty humour. This may even arguably be Anderson's BEST work to date.Ralph Fiennes' soft-toned and somewhat camp performance as Gustave is what truly takes this film into being a 'great' above all else. His character is such a well-developed personality that combined with Fiennes' acting makes seeing him such a remarkable watch. His delivery of lines, charming personality and chemistry with Tony Revolori, who plays his young and trusted friend, create for some absolutely hysterical moments constantly throughout. Overall this film is worthy as being Anderson's greatest film. With a running time of 1 hour 40 minutes the film just glides through and isn't hard to follow at all so casual film watchers shouldn't have a problem even if you're not too familiar with the director's work. One thing that may through people off is the aspect ratio of the screen. At the beginning, it starts off as widescreen but during the storytelling timeline the screen size scales down to just a box. At first sight it may look difficult to watch but it really isn't and if anything adds to the creative style the film holds. Definitely going to see this again."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 May 2015,9/10,"The central characters in Wes Anderson's films have always had a deep and inextricable connection to the places they love: Max Fischer had Rushmore; Royal Tenenbaum had the house on Archer Avenue; Steve Zissou had his ship, the Belafonte. Despite their usually roguish natures, these connections hint at some kind of deep sadness and longing beneath their charismatic facades. For them, these places are more than houses and boats and boarding schools—they represent something friendly and welcoming. They know that the world can be a cruel, cruel place and all they can really ask for from life is somewhere to call home—a sanctuary. For M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) of Anderson's remarkable new film, the titular location of The Grand Budapest Hotel is just that.Largely set in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka, the film uses four distinct time lines, each filmed in a different aspect ratio and colour palate precisely layered together. The first takes place in present day, and features a young girl walking through a garden to reach the tomb of an accomplished writer. Next is a flashback, in which the the writer talks directly to the audience about a time in the past when he visited the hotel. The third follows him in the 1960s, a young man at the time, through the hotel—a fading relic of a once vibrant and glorious past. There, he meets owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells him of the hotel's history and the hyper- competent concierge, Gustave, who is its main attraction. The final and longest time line picks up in 1932 and follows Gustave and Zero, now an inexperienced lobby boy, as Gustave inherits a priceless renaissance-era painting after an elderly socialite with whom he was sleeping is murdered under mysterious circumstances. What follows is a deft blend of genres—caper, murder mystery, prison break, and screwball comedy being the most recognizable.At the centre of the story is M. Gustave, a typical Andersonian hero. He's witty, gregarious, and empathetic. He is also, for lack of a better word, quirky: he recites romantic poetry to his employees, wears a liberal amount of perfume, and has a near god-like ability to anticipate the needs of his guests. What sets him apart from other Anderson characters, however, is his edge: he drinks, gets into fights, and relishes in the use of well-delivered profanity. In turn, this makes his sympathetic qualities stand out much more. He, above all else, understands that the unkindness of people comes from fear or institutional obligation rather than hatred. He is portrayed brilliantly by Fiennes, who adds a human sadness to this incredibly touching role, while seeming to have the most fun of his career.Filling out the rest of the cast is the usual cavalcade of Anderson actors—Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson all get minor roles—and seemingly every established character actor alive, including Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton—in spectacular old-age makeup —and Tom Wilkinson to name just a few. Deserving special attention is newcomer Tony Revolori as Zero. He brings a nervous energy to the film that works as a counterpoint to Gustave's ever-composed nature.The film also features some of Anderson's most experimental camera-work. He moves the camera beyond his usual whip-pans and tracking shots to create some of the most dazzling, empathetic filmmaking I've seen in recent memory. One particular standout shot features Zero's love interest, Agatha, looking directly at the camera with swirling lights around her head, representing the dizzying high of young love. He also uses his common techniques to great effect: every shot is beautifully and meticulously composed, and the script supplies a steady stream of locations for him to showcase his talent – a museum, a mansion, a prison, and especially, the hotel—all rendered in a high level of minute detail and shot in a distinct cinematographic style.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fun romp with a complex, emotional centre and is not to be missed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2014,10/10,"I have never been fortunate enough to watch works of the Director Wes Anderson but I do not usually connect with the works of a director in today's movie industry but the satisfaction of laying eyes over the imagination and absolute freedom of this director attracted me to write a review.The Grand Budapest Hotel wasn't flawless or a masterpiece in my eyes or even what I would categorize as a movie. It was odd even in the oddest categories of films that I have had a chance to watch. It merely gave away a confusing vibe, felt cheap at points and it had wrong pacing at points but the fact is that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie for just about 2 minutes until you are immersed into the words of a book for a matter of minutes and then again into imagination and thoughts of a fantastic listener who barely lays a word into the story. It is confusing but yet it all feels so cunning and organized that even from a newbie's perspective of his work it seems that even the confusion and pacing was so brilliantly placed. I will leave the rest for your eyes and imagination. As for the rating, I would give this movie a 10/10 because of how much freedom the director took, it made my jaw drop at points and had a sincere smile and a few killer laughs at times. I will watch it again very soon for that I already miss the feel of great imaginative adventure with a touch of brilliant comedy in this film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 December 2014,9/10,"This movie is simply a gem and I am glad it exists in the film world! Wes Anderson grants us the privilege of witnessing this visual masterpiece. I love the dialogue because it is so creative and engagingly witty... You fear and root for the characters because they are well-crafted and a treat to watch. I especially like the transformation of Harvey Keitel and William Dafoe, along with Tilda Swinton's fast-mouthed Madame D who is passionately in love with Monsieur Gustave in a tough kind of way. Such amazing characters put into delightful scenes are hard to not laugh at and adore. Some part of me wishes this was a true story because it is a classic tragicomedy. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys odd humor!!!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 September 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson has outdone himself. Funny, witty and excellently well done film. The quirkiness may put off some, but I loved every minute and have re-watched twice already.Having not been a fan of other Wes Anderson movies in the past, Fantastic Mr Fox, anybody? I found this to be a refreshing change to the director's previous offerings.Cinematography and style are both excellent, whether it be the false aspect ratio or the cartoon like effects, just wonderful.The actors on show provide a tour de force, F Murray Abraham, Jude Law are perfectly suited and then there in Ralph Fiennes who provides a masterclass in the art.Wonderful film that is truly unequalled as a complete work. While other films may have had loftier ambitions, this does not take itself too seriously and the result is a triumph.Bravo."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 March 2014,9/10,"I really enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel. The movie tells a story(literally), and I sat back and enjoyed every bit of it. There wasn't many dull moments, it was both witty and full of action. The story is told lightheartedly, but engaging.The scenery was colorful and strange as only a Wes Anderson movie can be. With beautiful backdrops and weird physics. Full of color most of the time, but grey and dull where it needed to be.The acting was good. It really suited the style of the movie, and why wouldn't it. Wes Anderson has picked old and well-known actors from many of his previous movies. Actors that are let loose to play people with excessive characteristics, and they seem to have a lot of fun doing it. I want to especially commend Willem Dafoe, as he does his role as a brute bad-guy to near perfection.If you like other Wes Anderson movies, you'll definitely like this one."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 July 2014,10/10,"So here I am writing my first review on IMDb, please ignore mistakes. I have been looking for a movie like this that is different from all current movies like stupid love stories and same old FBI agents thing or crazy high youngsters on a roll. It is a perfect movie in all aspects. Story, acting, picturization, pace all the aspects are perfect. It is not like any other comedy movies which contains double meaning jokes or creates situation comedy and that is what makes it special. Yes it is not a movie that will make you laugh so hard that you stomach starts to ache but it is good enough to find sensible humor out of the movie and relax. Just loved it. Wish to see more movies like this. Thanks everyone for reading it, appreciated."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 July 2014,8/10,"I did not know what to expect from this movie. I did not ""get"" the promos. I found myself rooting for it to get better and better.It pulled me in and I wanted it to be great. But it wasn't ""great"". It was very enjoyable though. The cast is fantastic, playing a bunch of eccentric, at times ridiculous characters without going over the top. Its wonderful to look at. Its wonderful to listen to. M.Gustave's enslavement to protocol is charming. One of its best moments is when he apologizes to his ""lobby boy"" Zero ""on behalf of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" while on the run. The movie seems to celebrate the flaws in people, places and buildings. Zero does not see the large birthmark on the woman he loves face. Just as he does not see the deep flaws in Gustaves character. Or the ravages of time on his beloved hotel."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 June 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, with its star studded cast, does a good job in portraying the adventures of a concierge and his lobby boy in a fictional early 20th century hotel, with a quirky yet elaborate narrative. The story follows the life of Z. Mustafa, and his adventures with the charming M. Gustave, wonderfully portrayed by the ever impressive Ralph Fiennes. Filled with bright colours and vivid imagery, the film never provides a dull moment in its entirety. However, the most striking feature of this film is that even the most gruesome acts are portrayed in such a manner that it borderlines on euphemism. Surely, this dark and brutal comedy will entertain audiences for years to come."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 May 2017,9/10,"Just wonderful movie, starting with a Very peculiar story the way it was recorded, it seems a sunset In a risky scene. The locations, the changing rooms, the decoration, everything It is very beautiful in this production. All details are very good CareRecommended to be seen!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 January 2015,10/10,"First I've watched this movie two times till now...only because to see the art behind this movie. This is the first movie I've watched of WES ANDERSEN. And want to see more. Wes Andersen made this fast forward movie very good in 4:4 square movie camera. the story telling of this movie is also very good... the film is very fast forward so not at all boring. and i think this is total movie. if you want good acting, sound composing, and good directing. watch this movie... Ralph Finns made great acting....yes ""Voldemort"" from harry potter... by this film you see a new genre awaiting and it is called ""ART"".and Alexandre Desplate has very good soundtrack... Hope can Win Most of the Oscars..This film has combination of Comedy, Emotions, Sadness, and satisfactions, and Smoothness, and at last happiness."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,10/10,"I have to admit and I hope you all will look past that I am extremely bias when it comes to Anderson's movies. But I would say that if you're new to his work this would be the perfect movie to start out with. The Grand Budapest holds truth to the uniquely colorful scenery, quirky characters and erratic story line of all of We's previous films but also has a pinch more mainstream feel to it with a more define and obvious conflict and a discernible line between the protagonists and antagonists. Wes was able to incorporate the right ingredients of comedy and drama that a lot of other movies that try to do this cannot find the right equation of the two without making it too dark or too bubbly that the drama seems almost unbelievable. The ending is that impressed me the most. After the protagonist's valiantly solve their conflict, guy gets girl, guy gets money, we're almost brought to tears to know that their happiness would not last. Even Zero, at the end says "" We were happy, for a little while"" ( paraphrase). And while this might be a excretion of my own taste, my own love for indifferent endings that happiness does not last, and Wes knows as in a few of his other movies that even if you do everything right, life doesn't always have a happy ending. And that impressed me the most. That and his quirky Gestapo. Wes really out did himself on this movie, Defiantly one of his best."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,5/10,"I read Mark Kermode's glowing review and decided this would make a good Sunday afternoon movie. Ralph Fiennes performance is as unexpected as it is sublime but did this movie have me laughing out loud? No, it was just too silly to be funny. Entertaining yes but funny? No, despite fantastic performances from outstanding celebrity actors, it just missed my funny bone at every opportunity. Tony Revolori was outstanding in the role of Zero the resourceful lobby boy who is befriended and becomes the protégé of Gustave H legendary concierge at the famous European hotel. Cast in the role of 'straight' guy to Gustave's rather slapstick character, he plays it dead pan throughout. I gave it 5 out of ten because although entertaining, I didn't laugh out loud once despite expectations. So as entertaining if somewhat unusual fiction 8/10 but as a comedy 5/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 August 2014,1/10,"Little, yes. Because of ""Grand"" it has nothing. Grand offense for my eyes and ears and for all the other people that were in the cinema with me. (Exactly 3 people); or I'd say two because one of them was my father, (sleeping), and I had my eyes completely ""blank"" like I had been assassinated by the movie. The Vissual effects were alright, but they could have been a lot better. I think that was the only good thing that the movie had. I didn't even get the funny jokes or even know what was exactly the plot of the movie. Absurd I would say. I was so glad when the intermission came in the middle of the movie and I could get some m&m's to tray and calm down from that horrendous nightmare that was the movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 April 2014,2/10,"Bear in mind, I am a huge fan of ""Tenenbaums."" This movie, however, is nothing but Anderson's statement that he just loves the current trend of men having douchebag moustaches and prancing about like dandy fops. Easily 85% of the male characters are afflicted with the upper-lip-hair scourge, and any semblance of a plot was soon overshadowed by the unveiling of yet another moustache. I could just picture the director being giddy with excitement as yet another such face appeared on screen.The narrator and the dialogue in general are characterized by a pompous, effeminate, overly genteel affectation, and felt contrived and stilted throughout."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 March 2014,1/10,"Having lost almost 2 hours of my life watching this pretentious, awkward, tedious,repetitive nonsense masquerading as a film, I felt an urgent need to warn my fellow movie goers of this stinker of a movie.The Great Budapest Hotel is ""in your face"" director's overindulgence in experimenting. It lacks even pretense of trying to tell an entertaining story. Its caleidoscope of disjointed themes crawls, mostly sideways, with the dreadful quality of a nightmare.One might fall into a trap of wishing to explore the latest ""oeuvre"" of a ""cult"" director/screenwriter. For those of you be warned, you'll need a strong motivation to sit through this indulgent mush of an experiment in viewers' goodwill.The one star goes for some striking images which ""do not a movie make""."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 April 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, inspired by the works of Stefan Zweig and written by Wes Anderson hit United States theaters on March 28, 2014. The story falls between comedy and adventure and throws the audience into the plot within the first ten minutes. The movie works its way through the plot by presenting a recollection of stories from the owner of the famous Grand Budapest Hotel in the fictitious country of Zubrowka (unless you don't want it to be fictitious then it is real), and is perhaps (and will be in my opinion) one of the best movies of 2014. The movie consists of some very well known actors such as Jude Law, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and the one and only Bill Murray. The movie is a non-stop comical adventure and leaves you attached to the characters from the get go. If you like the scoring of all of Wes Andersons usual movies then you will surely not be disappointed as the sound crew keeps the music similar to the other Anderson films. This movie is at a rating of 9/10 because although it was absolutely phenomenal, it wasn't a perfect movie. It was missing some sort of element that I can't seem to place my finger on. However, this movie made its way into my ""All Time Top Five Movie List"" and I will definitely purchase this movie on its Blu-Ray DVD release date."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 January 2020,10/10,"One of my all time favorite movies. Too amazing to really describe, it's funny, sad, pretty to look at, and generally very satisfying."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 March 2014,8/10,"Some of you may already know that I tend to have a positive predisposition towards Anderson's movies. I know this is not a very professional film criticism practice, but at least I have the decency to warn you. Nevertheless, even if you are not a huge fan of Anderson's films, I still insist this a film most cinephiles must watch. The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably one of Anderson's most original and aesthetically detailed films ever. The choice of colors and it's contrasts are just wonderful. I would dare to anticipate that the set design could be in the list of this year's Academy Awards. The story, as it's usual in Anderson, is so unexpected and original that one must set the mind in a state of openness and full receptivity in order to appreciate the vast capacity of imagination and detail this writer has. Even though the plot is simply the story of the The Grand Budapest Hotel, all the characters, the inner stories and playful structure take this simple story into a script worth keeping an eye on. For obvious reasons, Wes Anderson has become one of the most respected and groundbreaking independent filmmakers of our generation. This has allowed him to gather incredibly talented actors to be part of his movies for almost no payment. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception: Tilda Winston, Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, William Defoe, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jude Law, and Edward Norton are some of the incredibly talented actors of this cast. Once again, most of them were payed insignificant amounts. (That's definitely a great skill Mr. Anderson). Overall, this film is an ode to aesthetics, to visual experimentation, to creativity, to collaboration and to the art of original filmmaking. If these are not reasons enough to watch this film, please don't even bother to waste your time reading anymore of film posts. Otherwise, get up, go out and watch this movie.

THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 November 2020,3/10,What a mess ... the longest time I've ever watched something like this ... I cannot clarify but it all makes no sense
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 April 2014,1/10,Wes Anderson must have been high as a kite when making this film. The onslaught of colour and the architecturally questionable locations could only have been thought to be a good idea by someone who has just consumed a truckload of industrial strength LSD. Frankly watching the mentally unstable characters bounce around the screen was an experience I can only compare to being repeatedly hit in the face with a sock full of sick. The music was only comparable to listening to someone urinate on a cat and the script seemed like something that would spring from the mind of a dog sat at a typewriter.Ralph Fiennes was pretty good though.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,9/10,"Watching this movie in theater Concordia in Enschede The Netherlands, I had to laugh, was touched by its irony and the romance of the hotel and the 'Austrian' empire. And of course all those (great) actors playing in it. The descent from the ski-piste beginning at the monastery at a model piste was great. So was the music by Alexandre Desplat.The crossed keys society was brilliant found. Does the pope know about this?Furthermore the usually aspects of a movie: love, romance, action etc, but all with a twist.Just see this movie ;)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 April 2020,10/10,"My introduction to Wes Anderson. I was entertained throughout the whole runtime, and I was invested in the characters, even though it might be hard at times to find the story believable in our reality. The characters are not written as ordinary human beings, but still, you find the humanity in them and connect with them in ways you wouldn't expect. The music is fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful, which is especially appealing due to the various aspect ratio changes that Wes uses throughout the picture, as well as the gorgeous color palette. Highly recommended if you want to see Anderson's unique style shine at its finest. I am eager to rewatch it already."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 June 2014,10/10,"Wes Andersen is one of the truly great directors of our time. The way he makes movie is just delightful to watch as he uses his skills to make a movie as entertaining as possible. When it comes to ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" Wes Andersen has hit the bullseye on achieving this!!When i go to see a Wes Andersen movie i like going in without knowing what the movie is going to be about. That way i get even more surprised when i see what the director puts on screen. So what i would like you to know about the plot is that it's about a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) at a hotel called Grand Budapest. Thats just what i want to tell. Because the less you know, the more surprised you will be i hope. What i will say about the plot is that it's a great story that kept me interested from start to finish.What i can tell you is that i could't stop watching it and not smile. Every scene in this movie just had something to enjoy. Whether it's Andersen's style, writing, atmosphere or camera technique. Andersen just had a lot of enjoyable scenes which mixed comedy, violence and absurdity. The actors worked wonderful in this movie. Combining Andersen's classic actors featuring Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and a lot of other actors with Ralph Fiennes and newcomer Tony Revolori. They were both fantastic as the characters in the movie and fitted well into Wes Andersen's weird and absurd world as well as a lot of other actors in the movie.Why all of these characters worked so well doesn't just come from the acting, but also from the wonderful writing. The script is just simply amazing featuring dramatic moments as well as funny moments..and i do mean funny moments. I do believe this is perhaps Wes Andersen funniest script yet which a lot goes to Ralph Fiennes character who delivers them perfectly so you know just when to laugh. There are just so many quotable lines here that I'm sure you will memorize a lot of them after you've watched it.But it's not just the characters and writing that makes this movie so good. What really helps making this movie so good is the atmosphere. The set, color and location in this movie is just so beautiful to watch that almost every shot could have been the poster. This place that Andersen show us is just so wonderful that we want to live in it. Andersen's camera style and technique is perfected in this movie as we feel every shot throughout this movie was planned and accomplished just as the people behind it wanted.. The camera movements and the lens angle has become one of the most associated thing with Andersen's movies and people who haven't seen it before will without doubt love it when they see it for their first time. It's just such a visually stunning film you can't stop feeling like you have been transported into another place that you never want to leave.Since i didn't want to discuss much about the plot I'm not going to say what message this movie is trying to give, but i suggest you reflect upon it after watching the movie and look it up since it made this movie such a more delight for me. I don't know how much more praise i can give this movie. It's just a really great movie and Im considering this to be one of Andersen's best films, but as i am a huge fan of Wes Andersen it's hard for me to choose, but it is without doubt one of his greatest achievement in cinema. I don't think there are a lot of people who wouldn't enjoy this movie as i think it's the best movie that has gotten out this year and it will remain in my head for a long time.10/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 April 2014,9/10,"I am not a great movie watcher or critic, but I really enjoyed Grand Hotel Budapest. The cinematography was excellent, acting was great, plot unusual, and it had just the right amount of humor and emotion. Set in a colorful almost finger painting of central Europe in the 30's, it kept me engaged throughout trying to figure out who did it, what would happen next, who was that actor, and how would it all end. Highly recommended for boomers who are tired of special effects action movies where the world is being saved from aliens/fascists/communists/robots or where big stars are saving babies from evil family members/nasty businessmen/nasty government/nasty religions/nasty lawyers."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 August 2014,7/10,"Personally I'm a big fan of well written stories with a great plot, and I tend to dislike movies with cheesy ones. Even though The Grand Budapest Hotel does not have a spectacular plot, it is a movie worth watching. The characters in this movie are very well portrayed and I enjoyed getting to know them better. Besides the interesting characters, the locations used in this movie match perfectly with the entire story. It is obvious that there is spend a lot of time in finding these locations. But what I most liked about The Grand Budapest Hotel were the very creative camera angles and movements. Every shot could've been a painting. Visually wise this movie was outstanding, great editing, great use of color, great set dressing etc.So pretty much: Don't expect too much from the story, but DO watch it for it's visuals!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,1/10,"I did not know in advance what this film would be about. That was the first mistake. I thought I would indulge in two hours of grandeur, somewhere in the spirit of Titanic and Winter Tale. The first minutes made me sober up already. The next part was more or less bearable, but not really. After 50 minutes I did not know what bothered me more: the film or those bloody uncomfortable chairs in the socialism era built cinema in Slovakia. This film is not brilliant or anything of the exaggerated attributives as I have read here. It is just an utterly boring caricatural persiflage of various comic TV series. The main ingredients are cheap copies of humor chewed out long ago. A little bit of Monty Python, James Bond, Colditz, etcetera, etcetera. The only reason I stayed in the cinema was my wife: I know she does not like it when I walk out of the cinema during a film (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Avatar and other examples of movie failures)."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 December 2016,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a brilliant film, filled with an exciting story, lovable characters, a beautiful setting and a guaranteed laugh or two. No one delivers such rich and colorful worlds as Wes Anderson, and this one is no exception. The story put you right in a fictional universe where Europe is the stage of a new war. In the middle of all this chaos and barbarism there is still glimmers of civilization, in the man who is called M. Gustav. The story follows this fascinating character and his journey in the quest for the truth.If i had to pick one thing about the film that stands extra out, it is Ralph Fiennes brilliant performance which got him a well deserved academy award nomination for best actor."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 January 2019,10/10,Rivals Inglorious Bastards in its originality & humor.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 April 2014,9/10,"Why, oh, why, have I not read in any of the reviews on the first couple of pages any note of the very clear (to me, anyway,) homage in this movie to the Marx Brothers and WC Fields. From the names of people and places to the characters to the comic setups and even the tempo, both inspirations shine clearly through. Even though the movie is clearly set in WesAndersonland, it is truly a movie lover's movie with many links and references to the broad comedy of these geniuses of the 1920's and 1930s, which is, of course, the period of The Grand Budapest Hotel.The photography is visually lush with the feel of many paintings and painters of the era of Van Hoytel, painter of Boy with Apple.This is a movie for watching and re-watching and re-watching, over and over again. There are so many jokes and witty allusions that occur just outside the center of the screen and/or pass too quickly for real appreciation.I personally plan to STUDY The Grand Budapest Hotel for its many layers."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,14 March 2018,10/10,I saw the movie four years after its release and I was mesmerized by all the hidden plots it revealed. I am grateful for Wes Anderson for producing & directing it and for giving me many things to think about and for greatly entertaining me...Robert Breneman
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 October 2019,10/10,"A great movie that should satisfy the comedy genre enthusiasts
I truly recommend it with great pleasure"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 November 2014,9/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a comedy set between world wars one and two, Gustave H, the Grand Budapest Hotel concierge and Zero Moustafa, his ""lobby boy"" embark on a crazy adventure when one of Gustave's lover and guest dies leaving him a very important and expensive painting at her will. The film is divided into three time periods, the 80's 60's and 30's all easily distinguishable through the Grand Budapest Hotel's impeccable decoration. The film is very stylistic with it's bright colours and camera angles which gives the aspect of a very organized chaos and allows for a number of image systems to be placed without the fear of interfering with the plot. The most obvious image system is it's own crop factor. The film variates between three different aspect ratios which separates the three different time periods. During the 80's we experience a cinema-scope aspect ratio (2.35:1), when the characters are in the 60's the film is shown at standard wide-screen (1.85) and throughout most at the film which happens in the 30's the factor is in 4x3 (1.37). From the beginning to the end of the film's time-line the Hotel gets progressively worst and so does the posture that the characters adapt, with the choice of replicating the time periods using aspect ratio it also helps to unbalance the frame weight, the closer to a square the more balance a frame will be at both the X and Y axis, this is also noticeable with the lens choice that gets wider within time generating more and more curved lines and distancing the viewer from an idealistic symmetry. An other very obvious image system is the film's own colour pallet. Each hotel, institution, family or just any group of people have it's own key colour and Wes Anderson uses it as a conscious device that helps the viewer orients himself in the story with this unusual method. The Grand Budapest Hotel staff is always wearing a purple uniform, the family of Gustave's lover (which represents the film's antagonist) always wears black, the prisoners wear a tinted pattern of white and gray stripes, the police force wears gray (part of the antagonistic factor throughout most of the film), the other hotels has it's representatives wear the same saturation value ￼￼￼￼ of the purple uniform but with blue, orange, red, green and brown uniforms, the monks are always wearing white robes and Agatha (love interest) is often bringing with her a pink box from her bakery. In this case the amount of saturation seams to be an equivalent to the ""goodness"" of the characters, which makes for a very easy way to understand who is who at chaotic scenes with hundreds of extras, such as the final battle at the hotel. Throughout the entire film characters are shown from different kinds of rectangular frames which gives the viewer the ability to reflect the scene as if seen from the inside of the film but as an outsider to the action, it is as if we were watching it all from a window, it also makes for a very comedic motif. Some of the characters are shown with a circle vignette around their face, because the only two characters whom are presented with the vignette in the end of their development are the ones that goes through certain character change, the unusual effect could be associated with the closure of the character's internal development. The entire film is filled with little image systems, shapes and interesting frames that fits beautifully within this world where everyone tries to act as robotically polite as possible at the most chaotic situations which makes for a grate example of format following content."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 May 2015,8/10,loved it As it goes flawless movie for me in the view of acting is concern. I strongly believes it might have gone for winning Oscars if it has released in 2 to 3 years back. I love the whole cast. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing and he is one of the best lead roles in an Anderson movie to date. Newcomer Tony Revolori easily keeps up with Fiennes doing a fantastic job. Everyone else from Norton to Ronan are fantastic. The set design and cinematography are magnificent as usual with great scenery and cool children book style backgrounds. The comedy hits every time and it even packs some surprises to with a great murder mystery that gels with a road film. There's even some sweetness underneath the zaniness giving it some surprising depth to it.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 April 2014,10/10,"This film is precisely what an elaborate imagination in the field of cinematography has to offer. It's stylized in a way that is truly thoughtful and charming, with locations and environments that are the definition of an emotional back drop. The film delves into the emotion of each character with even a spot of dialogue, in a way that lets us truly connect to each individual, especially with our protagonists, Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. When you can feel for each emotion of our characters, it allows us to thoughtfully explore their ideas, and let's us predict what's going to happen next, good or bad. Leaving room for a genuine connection to our characters is in strong standing with this masterpiece. Location and set design were definitely my favorite parts of this film. At the start of the film, we're introduced to a novelist who apparently wrote the whole story of The Grand Budapest Hotel. The story of the hotel is told which opens up a transition for the modern day hotel to the 1936 hotel which literally blew me away. It gave an excellent feel for the time period, along with the general attitude of the populace of that time. The colorful surroundings of the grand Budapest among other places, made me want to stay there myself. The touch of cartoonish absurdity with the characters surroundings kept that oddball humor with each little immaculately composed shot. The amazing dialogue, fully fleshed out characters, and enormous attention to detail, definitely set this one off as Wes Anderson's best."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 July 2014,10/10,"Most films that are released now are either cheap comedy films, cliché action films or superhero movies. Apart from some exceptions. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those exceptions. With the perfect blend of dark humour, a brilliant storyline and fabulous directing this certainly is Wes Anderson's best film yet. Anderson's films are definitely stylised to say the least and not all people like his style of still shots with a vintage look and feel. Personally I love it, he is one of this generations best directors. That man is an artist. You can tell the amount of effort from, not just Wes but the cast as well, that went into every shot to make it as good as it can be. The soundtrack matches perfectly to the film and the humour is laugh-out-loud funny. The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my all time favourite films and I am proud to say so. I look forward to Anderson's films to come and I hope he continues to make fantastically beautiful films for a long time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 February 2015,7/10,"I did never understand why Wes Anderson: didn't get the fair recognition for ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", but now it's happening with a movie not better that this, but maybe with a much more great budget!. Did you miss ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""?. So I invite you to do so, and feel that feeling that something is very wrong here. And one of the awkward feeling is: for this kind of movies, who can be better that Bill?, who can say anything in a movie that every time makes you feel good and willing to keep seeing the movie?, yes, only Bill!. Why this happens?, Why this movie seems to be more successful that The Aquatic Life?."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 August 2014,9/10,"It is a fantastic film.Firstly,in terms of style,the lines are so beautifully written with interwoven poems that add elegance to the film.Some remarks are so classic that I listen to them time and time again,like""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.""As for the pictures,I must say,they are dreamlike.It is like I'm appreciating art.Every shot is carefully taken and contains certain meanings.And Wes Anderson pays attention to every little details.Out of curiosity,I read the newspapers in the film and found even the news content are carefully written.The scores are excellent and they haunt me for days.Some are grand,some are light-hearted and while some are absorbing and exciting.Lastly I want to talk about the cast.As many viewers have commented before,the cast is star-studded and no one is out of place.However,I still want to mention the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori.Their natural eye contact and dramatic body gesture impress me. In terms of its content,I think it conveys a sentiment that pays tribute to a kind of gentlemanship that is lost before the World War Two.Mr.Gustave,a perfect example of such spirit ,was shot to death by the overbearing military.I am moved from time to time by Mr.Gustave's gentile and noble deeds.For example,he takes care of the inmates at Check Point 19,which also helps his own escape.And even maybe at the last moment of his life,he doesn't forget to recite an excerpt of a poem.Not to mention,he protests the thuggery at the cost of his own life.Yet he is not a saint,of course,he is vain,needy,insecure and a little mean,I guess. At last,I want to mention several shortcomings.The script,though sophisticated and elegant,contains several rude words.And some erotic scenes are not that necessary."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 March 2014,10/10,"Well... It was not the first so I knew to expect to an unusual movie... I have to tell you, it is not a movie for everyone and when you see this movie-be open minded.I saw some movies of Wes Anderson and I can tell you- this is the best movie that he directed (and wrote of course, that he didn't do that alone and the story wasn't his). The movie is strange and maybe even a little bit disturbing but in a good way. The acting of Ralph s. Fiennes was as always, fantastic and it was ""really happy"" to see the crew- Edward Norton, Adrien Brody,Jude Law, Jeff Goldblum and more actors that act really well and were acting in ""trash movies"". SO... This movie is recommended but remember- this movie isn't for everyone and be open minded."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 May 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is so delicate and ornate it is a visual feast to look at. The movie is done briskly in chronological order that you feel as though you're watched a bustling kitchen of cooks rushing to make their next meal, Anderson does this intentionally and what we don't know is: The meal was warm and ready since the very beginning. Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham star as the legendary concierge and his pupil. Resulting in long, fast-paced scenes in which we watch them walking quickly through the ostentatious halls of the Hotel. Wes Anderson's sets are lovely as usual, his writing is fast and funny, it never feels bogged down by its subject matter, and the acting from the studded cast is superb, each actor and actress play there character exactly as they'd like, making it easier to like the characters themselves. The cast includes; Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Saoirse Ronan, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Léa Seydoux, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Shwartzman, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, and Tony Revolori as the young ""Zero Moustafa."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 September 2021,10/10,"I have watched this film countless times and love it more each time. The characters are spectacular and the cast playing them are amazing! The sets, the locations, the costumes are just divine. Recommend to everyone!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 March 2014,10/10,"WOW! What a film! I love Wes Anderson's work and I think this is probably his finest! Although this film is brilliant, it went right over my head and 2 hours afterwards, I could hardly remember any of it. And I find that hilarious! But seriously this film will go down as one of my favorite's because of its great story, brilliant cinematography and camera angles and amazing actors! Wes Anderson's style of filmmaking is probably my favourite, (along with Tarantino) because of his quirky characters, all of his story's are completely unique and hilarious with a pinch of drama. His pacing is so fast! The grand Budapest could have easily been over 2 hours because of it's complicated story but because Anderson's paving is so fast the film is only 100 Min's. It is such a brilliant film and I would definitely recommend seeing it if you haven't seen yet."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 April 2015,10/10,"Between the symmetrical scenery, the camera angle giving us the impression and feeling that we are there as well, the long forgotten character belonging to a true gentleman, and finding humor in such a horrid time, I believe Wes Anderson outdid himself. I always explain his work as being like a movie that you read or a book that you watch. It's difficult to explain unless you see the film for yourself. Others who know his work will understand completely. If you have a short attention span and are a part of the genre everyone keeps demanding the World to ""dumb it down"" for, than this film is not for you. It contains emotions from within a place of substance and wholesomeness. More directors need to aspire to regain the authentic outlook on life which Wes Anderson harbors."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 December 2019,8/10,Fun movie with quirky humor and great acting. The movie takes the viewer in quite a ride.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 February 2015,5/10,"I am shocked how well this movie has done among IMDb users and critics. The cast is amazing, but the movie is truly terrible. I walked out of Rushmore and would have done the same here. The characters were annoying, the dialog pointless and I was just waiting for it to end. Bleh.I did not understand why any of the characters acted the way the did. The little cuts that Anderson employees so freely for dramatic effect just seemed pointless. There was a sequence where there were cuts between different hotel managers that was funny through two cuts and then just dragged on and on as each manager had to stop what he was doing and put his Boy in charge. That is this movie in a nutshell -- it dragged on and on. That could have been interesting to see how a whole network of hotel managers could have been activated, but it just ends up being pointless."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 March 2014,9/10,"Checking into a room in your local Premier Inn conjures up feelings of weariness, unpredictability and Lenny Henry cautiousness. Case in point (on in the hands of a hotel baggage handler) you never know what you're going to expect which is precisely the attraction of Wes Anderson's (Fantastic Mr Fox) dramatic comedic sensation, The Grand Budapest Hotel; a film definitely worthy of a night in the cinema. Such a refreshing and genuinely decent film, The Grand Budapest contains enough well-crafted scenes and laugh out loud jolliness to make it well worth a watch. One of the major entices for seeing it comes from a cast of grandiose proportions. Usually, a formula of catastrophe follows suite for any film that attempts to sell its films on names alone but, luckily, they pretty much all work here; creating unforgettable characters undergoing ludicrously funny happenings. All of which is engine fired by one man: a legendary concierge by the name of Gustave H played charmingly by Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) who gets caught up in a sticky situation involving a will, a painting and his own unmoving ego/pride towards his beloved and whimsical hotel, The Grand Budapest. With his trust firmly cemented in his closest friend; a lobby boy by the name of Zero played by new to my eyes Tony Revolori and older version by F. Murray Abraham, the film throws them into an adventure that will have you pissing your self-folding cinema seats in laughter.To me, the comedy is the commendable victor here as every scene seems to concur it in its own way. Whether it be the sharp profanities mixed randomly with otherwise civilised dialogue or simply the way all the characters dash around give off a very Monty Python tone. The comedy merges well with Anderson's ability to frame scenes perfectly and as such almost frame the comic timing as well. We can feel the moments where characters don't have a bloody clue what's going on because even they know that the situations they end up in are bonkers. It's even scenes like this that play to the strengths of certain actors who sometimes seem out of place; particularly Edward Norton who plays a military man of law called Henckels and, more importantly, isn't that bad either. However, it's still remarkable how so much chemistry was explored on screen between all these different characters. In fact, there's so many different characters coming and going, the game of Spot the Actor slowly morphs into Name the Character if you Can which can play on your confusion when following who's doing what. Christ, even Owen Wilson (Marley and Me) makes one of the briefest encounters on screen ever as character M. Chuck who comes and goes quicker than you can say, ""room service"". Special mention to a completely unrecognisable Tilda Swinton (We Need to Talk About Kevin) who gets her wrinkles on and plays Madame D. an ancient looking women who puts the film in motion. The Grand Budapest Hotel really understates its use of the word 'grand' as both the institute and the film looks gorgeous. The sets and the colour palates still look wet with detail and all in all work extremely hard to purport an undoubtedly theatrical approach that the film is going for. A translation from film to theatre would almost be seamless as Anderson commands the camera to lock scene by scene without ever really moving on until it has to. The characters all know this style and adopt it gracefully giving the film a picture book quality complete with pop out art and the like. There's even a worthy Hitchcock tribute where lawyer Deputy Kovacs played by mumbling extraordinaire Jeff Goldblum (The Fly) is being pursued by a very grizzly and sinister mercenary by the name of Jopling played by Willem Dafoe (Beyond: Two Souls) in a history museum; which is an almost replica representation of an event that Paul Newman finds himself in during 'Torn Curtain' (1966). Nicely done Anderson considering the entire feature is shot on location in Germany (again, a plot wise relation to the previously specified Hitchcock wonder piece). Seriously, it's a beautiful film to look at and the level of creativity is off the wall, not just in design but technique.If you're looking for something light hearted, if you are looking for a film with a timeless quality to it or if you are genuinely interested in watching a kind-hearted Adrien Brody (The Pianist) playing a villain swamped with greed then please go and see this film. It's of a fantastic quality and a triumph in imagination and character balancing. Writers can burn and shrivel when tasked with a battalion of wacky characters, but The Grand Budapest has enough room for everyone and you won't be disappointed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 April 2014,10/10,"The last time I saw a film more than twice at the cinema I was 10 years old, and i braved the heat and nicotine fug of the ABC cinema in Streatham south London to stare agog, mouth open, at 'Jaws' the grand Budapest Hotel is more than a film about the noble aspirations of the service industry against the backdrop of fascism, murder and cake, but that's what it IS about,it is the last eloquent rendering of light on canvas since Lumiere, where art, story telling, words, music a winter Olympic chase scene and counting for SOMETHING in this life all sit down together at the table of a saddle of lamb, see it twice, with your most deserving friend and maybe an aunt."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 December 2017,10/10,"he Grand Budapest Hotel is the story of Zero Moustafa, played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori, and his adventures with M. Gustave, played by Ralph Finnes. The story revolves around the death of a wealthy patron, Selene Villanova DeGoeff und Taxis played by Tilda Swinton, and the ensuing adventures created by the disposition of her estate. At its heart, this is a coming of age story but instead of the usual formula of a young person finding their way in the world we have a maturing of both main characters in as they are forced to confront a changing world out of their control. From the view point of our main character Zero, this is a classic young hero motif as he seeks to create his own future by emulating his new-found hero, M. Gustave and gain some entry into the closed luxurious world of The Grand Budapest Hotel. In contrast, M. Gustave matures throughout the movie and his interactions with Zero as he begins to realize he may care about something other than himself and his wealthy patrons, namely his protégé Zero. The genius of Wes Anderson is truly on display in this film as he brings these two characters closer together of the course of several adventures and interactions. This is best illustrated in the contrast between the linked scenes in the train stopped in a barley field. The first time this happens and violence ensues M. Gustave shouts, ""Get your hands off my lobby boy"" while the second time he says, ""Get your hands off him"". As can be seen from the difference in phrasing the two main characters have grown together in a significant way. Wes Anderson has been honing this thematic technique throughout his career with movies such as ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" which are essentially movies about identity and discovering one's self in a world which one may not fit in. In The grand Budapest Hotel, he takes his vision to new heights by creating a world unto itself using nearly recognizable events and places. While there is no place called Zubrowka or Lutz, Anderson creates a believable setting using words like Sudeten and an ominous organization, the Zig Zag, symbolized by a ZZ. These subtle ques and Wes Anderson ability to create a unique world in extreme detail makes this a rich setting but the vague familiarity of it allows the viewer to concentrate on the story and the characters. With universal themes of discovery and coming of age presented in a fresh way and through the vivid expression of the director, this film waits patiently to be a classic for all time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 April 2014,9/10,"A brilliant slice of life story--- a madcap adventure combining a thrilling ride of romance, comedy and drama centered around an eccentric perfectionist seeking to save humanity and civilization from itself. Really entertaining with everything from a prison break using hand tools to an exhilarating chase of a ski slope--really excellent and entertaining from start to finish. On the deeper side, this film analyzes how far one should go to do what's right versus what's convenient even when what's right could be deadly! It points to a life well lived by defending what's important (romance, reputation) against evil motivated by greed and jealousy. What's important to the central character at the end is not his ownership of a ruined hotel, but the memories that made it come alive for him earlier in his life and fortunately too for us in this film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,9/10,"(This is coming from a cinema lover who watches action, adventure, horror, drama and Independent films) Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. When my friend asked me out to it I had no clue what the plot was, who was in it, or what the title even was. I recalled seeing one trailer for it a while back but it went over my head. Remembering the trailer this movie seemed to be nothing too special. But I was very wrong. I can happily say this movie is awesome. The Grand Budapest set itself apart from your common mainstream movies with a talented cast and a beautiful unique style. The first thing I noticed was that the movie is not shot for your typical widescreen theaters. This was completely square on the screen and that gave it a antique vibe right off the bat. The story is based on a book and having not read the novel I cannot touch on that subject but I will say I was weirdly immersed throughout. There are no explosions or action scenes to reel you in. The movie's pure style and class grab you by the balls and wont let go until the credits roll. Even then I wanted to sit in the theater and listen to the credit music. Despite the main cast shown throughout the movie big time actors held relatively small parts in this movie and I think that is another aspect that makes this viewing a real treat. An example is Bill Murray appearing for about 4 minutes with a short cameo performance. He didn't try to steal the show or take over the scene. A couple other big names came up in the same sense. The overall acting is great. A comedic touch is added and basically picks fun at past literature. A character will go on into a fancy quote and decide to give up on it interrupting themselves with a ""Oh f*** it"". The style, cast, and plot all tie together to create a chill, funny, eye opening and amazing movie. There is so much to love here and I cannot explain it all. This is a movie you must see for yourself. I definitely recommend if you want a different kind movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 April 2014,10/10,"A short review of the film which is to my best knowledge the most fantastic one that has ever been produced.One would have to take a picture of every shot, frame it, and display it in an art gallery. And then one would not even have begun to analyze the depths of the story. This is the moment where I realize that I have never seen such a movie in my life and never will. Wes Anderson has got to be laughing himself to sleep every night, thinking about the people with an IQ of one hundred and ZERO creativity.This last sentence is just to make IMDb allow me to post this very short comment."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 April 2014,2/10,"While the film was beautiful pictorially, the all-star cast was wasted on a flimsy script that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious. The story itself is a good one, and might have been very compelling if it were handled in a serious way but they way it was handled was plain awful. If Anderson wanted to make a comedy if should have had many more laugh lines in the script. The chuckles from the audience were few and far between, and in fact, they almost sounded somewhat embarrassing, like we're supposed to laugh at this part. You really wonder whether any of the cast actually read the screenplay beforehand. I'd have to say this was pretty disappointing."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 January 2015,9/10,"I decided to watch this movie when I heard about 9 Oscar nods it received .I initially thought it's going to be some overly-artistic director's ridiculously imaginative boring movie. But, it was totally, absolutely different from what I expected. This movie turned out quite quirky, hilarious and sweet movie.Plot was light-hearted and very very simple.One hell of Every element is breathtaking, electric. With a continuous ensemble of beautiful images, an imaginative script, cinematography and brilliant comedic timing, there is absolutely no lag. The entire film is beautifully on point. This movie is a treat. For the eyes, for the ears, and also for the heart.A must watch feel good movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 April 2014,9/10,"I've never been one for art films, seeming as I'm an art student this is quite odd. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel caught my attention and changed my opinion on art films for the better. It is understandable and easy to follow, being divided into chapters or 'parts'. It is laid out like a book, pacing the story well. As someone who has a poor attention span this was a great thing!The colours in this film are amazing! I found myself pointing excitedly to my other art student friends the complimentary colours and colour schemes used. As sad as I've made myself sound, it makes a change from the old doom and gloom, post-apocalyptic, unsaturated brown we often see in the cinema now days. There is a lot of humour hidden within what could be a dark plot, so rather contrasted in look when the story is taken into consideration. With plenty of casual swearing and sarcastic comments, it struck a cord with my British sense of humour. I do not particularly have any complaints about the film besides it was rather short. I was left wanting more but only because I was enjoying it so much, almost didn't want it to end. One thing that was a little confusing was the mix of British, French and American accents. However, no fuss, it gave it character.Overall, it is an astonishingly colourful film, full of character and life (or maybe not so in poor Tilda Swinton's case). The artistic direction gave way to beautiful scrapbook like scenes with what seems to be paper cut outs. Each part has a title card that features embroidery from what I remember. Also, it has an old fashion feel to the methods of filming. Editing is intended to look bad with obvious green screen and other 1970s-esque effects, making the film more zany than it already is. Definitely one worth watching!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 May 2014,1/10,"Never did i think that i would ever be enough intrigued by the awfulness of movie to create an account just to write a review about it. I can't possibly understand how some people would ever enjoy such a movie. So boring and lacking an interesting story. Let alone the fact that its not even funny! I felt sorry for the crowd watching the movie with us, i could feel the pain in their eyes and i could hear the prayers inside their heads hoping that the movie gets better! I mean come on look at it's high rating! It must be good, i will get better, it should! But it never did. I usually appreciate the ""artsy"" side of movies, but this one i couldn't even swallow it. And don't even get me started with the horrible animated scenes. As an animator, it felt like poison to my eyes!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 May 2014,1/10,"So, here I am again after trusting the IMDb rating only to be disappointed. Does this movie deserve the 1 star rating that I have given it? No. Does it deserve the bloated hyped 8.4? No. This movie is a 6. However I feel as though I owe to the IMDb community to help balance the rating.I was looking forward to this movie, excitedly anticipating it's release date. Visually, this movie had it all, which is what you would expect from a Wes Anderson movie, however, it did not have anything else. It was almost as though we are expected to be satisfied by just that. Don't get me wrong, I love and cherish most of his works. I mean Moonrise Kingdom has to be one of my all time faves..and Fantastic Mr Fox's genius screenplay will always be my cussing fave. But this movie felt empty, it lacked something. You cannot churn out the same visual beauty every time and expect the same hype, there needs to be innovation, whether it is visually, via screenplay or plot. This is what upsets me, there was no innovation. Without innovation there's nothing new, the punchlines are few and far in between, the plot was boring and character's were not well rounded.Maybe the money that should have been spent developing the above was spent sending armies of people to bloat this rating. I don't know. I will not jump on this ""It's a Wes Anderson movie so I have to love it"" bandwagon. That's my rant over. Until next time!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 July 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's newest movie, telling the tale of the legendary Gustave H, in his early days after a man staying in the hotel asks about how he came to get the hotel. The sets are brilliant and realistic, and the actual hotel was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The story line is one of the best that I have ever experienced in a movie, and the film is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It is magnificent. It mixes action, comedy, thrillers and a dash of romance to create what I think is definitely the best film of 2014. When I walked into the cinema to watch this film for the first time I had very high expectations thanks to Anderson's previous masterpiece, Moonrise Kingdom, when I walked out of the cinema I knew that it had lived up to its expectations, later becoming one of the best movies that I have ever seen."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 May 2014,9/10,"I love this movie ! I spent a really great time watching it with my friends in high spirits. Indeed, I didn't expect it at all but The Grand Budapest Hotel was one of the most hilarious movies that I've ever watched. I don't know why, but some scenes made me think to Charlie Chaplin's films. It's not only a funny film, it's also a very aesthetic one. Images are very beautiful, with symmetry, pastel colors, and style details. The characters are endearing, the screenplay is really well designed and you don't get bored one second. In short, don't hesitate and run to the cinema. Tonight !"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 May 2014,10/10,"Film director Wes Anderson creates his own world, full of colourful characters and nicely warm atmosphere. Every little detail and every set made me speechless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war. Anderson has given thought and attention to everything. The plot is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it almost comical manner. Ralph Fiennes is acting as the Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel. Although, film director's choice of actors is fantastic and even side scenes are played very well. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. There are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time. Both camera and sound operators did a great job, thats why film catches attention of audience. I would recommend this film for those who are searching for the film, that could change their world-view and make them laugh at the same time. It is fulfilled with irony and colour."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,22 May 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of 2014 and perhaps one of the most skilfully made films of all time. Directed by Wes Anderson, The Grand Budapest Hotel is the next masterpiece to hit cinemas.Wes Anderson is known to be one of the most skillful directors of all time. He knows exactly how to get the best out of his performers and how to write an amazing screenplay. He also knows how to position a camera, unlike many of the blockbuster film directors (Michael Bay). The Grand Budapest is so captivating and interesting that you just can't take your eyes away.The screen writing was absolutely fantastic and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination this year. It has amazing character descriptions and development. Interesting story and different tensions and comedic moments. The climax is utterly one of the most thrilling, yet hilarious, of all time. Ralph Fiennes is absolutely perfect for this role and the usual Wes Anderson performers give great performances as well, for example, Bill Murray. Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most skillful films you will see for the year. 10/10 = A+"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,27 May 2014,10/10,"Wes Anderson has produced a truly one of a kind film with The Grand Budapest Hotel. A beautifully crafted score with unique characters, props, and set designs is just the beginning as the film continues to impress with genius storytelling that captures the viewer and evokes a variety of emotions. For the length of the film, it feels as if one has escaped into a very different time and a very different place that Anderson has amazingly constructed for our viewing pleasure.This kind of film may not be for everyone. But if you enjoy the timeless Wes Anderson creations such as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums etc., then you just might consider this one a masterpiece! I don't understand how there can be so many Wes Anderson 1 Star reviews on IMDb! It is obvious that the majority are unable to appreciate the beauty and humor these films offer."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,6 June 2014,10/10,"I have seen a few of Wes Andersons films now and to be honest while undeniably a talented director, they often left me bemused. If this is a director bringing all together, than I can only hope his next output is as well judged.The adventures of Gustave H & Zero are magical, in a world of CGI driven nonsense they remind you what the very best of cinema still has to offer. I had seen trailers for this and thought it would be worth a watch, but this is hands down the best film I have seen in a very long time.For a film to be so full of fun and charm and yet display almost constant imagination and flair is some achievement. The cast are fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes gives a performance which must rank among his very best, pitch perfect to the last he is the beating heart of the film, Tony Revolori (who I confess I have never seen before) is also worthy of a mention and his characterisation of Zero is full of warmth. However to be honest the entire cast (and like many of Mr Andersons films...its some cast) is fantastic to a man and woman.Even if you think it might not be your type of film, I urge you to watch it...you wont regret it.Well done Mr Anderson, I can wait for your next film."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,11 June 2014,5/10,"It had some funny scenes and a some what inspiring plot.But how can it seriously get such a remarkable reviews, whilst the conclusion of the movie makes almost no sense, in that they hardly explain the ending at all! and leaving so many questions unanswered. If that's what it takes to make a good movie then I guess all the bad directors/writers of the world should take notice. As long as the ending is happy just leave everything to ambiguity. It seems they insult the viewer by leaving everything undefined, whilst giving the premise as if they didn't.We as the audience to really try to feel for the characters and to has suspended disbelief in the plot, however this is hard when they are killed off in the end for no reason in ridiculous ways dark humour perhaps? How did Gustave save the boys life by dying? Surely they would have killed the boy anyway if that's what they intended. Idiots would leave this point unnoticed.On a side note the choice of casting for the main cast was crude at best. The actor that plays the kid looks to be from the middle east with a dark olive skin completion, and the older version appears to be Slavic with a big Bulgarian nose, absurd to say the least how hard can it be, they could hardly have looked more different. 5/10 is perfectly reasonable score for this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 July 2015,1/10,"Bloody terrible. It seems that IMDb's ratings are always a disappointment when looking for a new movie. I was so bored, unmoved and unamused by this film that I almost fell asleep watching it. I've only ever had that happen once in my life and that was being dragged to see Pink Panther 2 so I'm certain you can weigh up just how terrible and how much I hated this film. My partner wasn't so lucky and began to snore just before the half way point. This movies ratings are based solely on artificial popularity and by that I mean it's rated like a branded hoody: extremely over priced, over RATED and of the same quality as primark. I feel as if nearly an hour of my life has been wasted and I will never get that back."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 July 2014,1/10,To watch that movie is the same thing as to look to a very old album of photograph. An album from an unknown person. An album from someone you never knew. It was extremely boring. Total waste of time. I want my money back. I saw the viewers opinion and thought it was an exceptional movie. But it was impossible not to sleep. I wonder how could such got actors accept to participate such a movie. I always read the viewers review in this site to decide what movie to see. That was the first time I got disappointed The movie had such a good punctuation. Next time I will not trust the viewers review. Maybe the evaluation made by the critics never really expresses the opinion of regular people. Next time I will be careful on the viewers opinion.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my absolute favorite movies. I've never read the book, but the film was fantastic. Some of Wes Anderson's other movies(The Royal Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket, etc) are a bit slow paced and lost my attention at times. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel held my attention throughout the entire movie. It's fast-paced and I fell in love with all of the quirky characters. It's such a great, feel-good movie and I highly recommend it! Ralph Fiennes is wonderful, as are all of the usual actors in Anderson's films. I was worried the film would be slow, but it was so endearing and entertaining! Every little detail and quirk made it so much better!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,19 July 2014,1/10,"This could involve SPOILERS (you have been warned) So recently decided to watch this film, watching the trailer I had quite high hopes for the film.The film makes no sense characters come and go constantly so every character seems to be pointless. You care about no character in the film.Also one of the characters between past and present changes race which seems to make no sense. This is by far one of the worst films and a an absolute waste of 100 minutes of my life.The only thing someone may like about this film which I did not agree with is, if they like films that are odd and disjointed If I could give this a rating of 0 I would, it is the worst film I have seen in years Do not watch this film!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 April 2018,9/10,"I liked story of film. kind of beginning and ending the film was really inventive. 
Of course, I though story is deceptive and incomplete (sometimes), but it is still justifiable.
finally, you can enjoy from all minutes that will drown you in a fantastic piece of a person's life."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 August 2014,9/10,"This movie was one of the movies which was mysteriously interesting. Even though a bit of the focus of the story was laid upon the viewers on the early part of the movie. The movie had me ""gespannt wie ein flitzebogen"". This masterpiece was perfectly made with distinctive visual and narrative style. Same as Ronald Dahl's (Fantastic Mr.Fox). It isn't one of those movies which were just twisted plots. It is THAT movie that has twisted plots. After watching this movie i wished there would be more movies with this kind of style. Worth watching. Final verdict its just something you should watch to understand.Something worth spending time on because for me its just ""That good"". Though there were parts which made me say ""ugh"" or something in disgust or in reaction to violence. This movie made a mark on my mind. Made me smile. Which most of the movies in our current gen don't do. 9/10"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 September 2014,8/10,"I didn't have any prerequisites before seeing this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the very central European look and cinematic style by US Director Wes Anderson. The very stylistic staccato type of acting,the beautiful (almost Art Deco) coloring and scene setting was a welcomed change to the infamous Hollywood style of instructors, and seeing the full line-up of star actors doing these low key parts was simply a joy. The cinematic style reminded me of the of french instructor (Amelié, Knick-knack, Delicatessen for the prison escape scene) and many of the non-verbal comedy facings of the actors might even be inspired by cartoon TV-series Miniscule of little creatures acting without wording (race scene, closeups)- but it absolutely Works ind I enjoyed every minute of the film.Definitely worth keeping for a second review and a major candidate for Best Film of 2014 :-)"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 May 2015,10/10,"Wes Anderson's superb eye for visual storytelling comes to a head with this luscious murder mystery that starts out in an exclusive luxury hotel and thrills the audience throughout Europe.Those like myself who admire auteur-driven film making can celebrate with the release of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" the best movie of 2014 at this early stage, and perhaps likely to remain so for some time to come.Once again, Anderson has managed to make an affecting, funny movie; it may be more melancholy than most, but bittersweet love is love nonetheless, and The Grand Budapest Hotel is worth visiting multiple times.A quick-wit- comedic and vibrant presentation that can only be developed by Wes Anderson. The Grand Budapest Hotel is an overall marvelous film that is captivating from its artistic direction, sharp humor and dazzling performances from such a dynamic cast led by Ralph Fiennes"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 October 2014,9/10,"The reality. Now, that's nothing to do with this film. However, being from East Europe, I can attest that the air, the feeling is East European to it's bottom. Of course, you scream with laughter when you see the mix-up of all different East European cultures (East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czech) but you just realize that it was created by an American, who does not know. For hell, the contrary. I am sure that he was fed from childhood with Mark Twain (the most European American author) and shat Kafka, Orkeny and Gombrowicz to name only a few great East European storytellers. So all-in all, I am just giving 9 for this masterpiece as God himself is only perfect."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 October 2014,6/10,"This movie is a visually stunning scenario that never becomes a story worth hearing. The literary artifices of nesting narrations and the picture-book-like montages are not garnishes on a sumptuous plot, but just morsels plotted into a course of snacks that never makes a meal.This hodgepodge results from the assemblers' (Anderson et al.'s) desire to assemble plot-components into a movie scenario--the consequence of absence of desire to tell a story the writers feel, with any passion whatsoever, compelled to tell.Because the writers know we'll know they're recycling leitmotifs of the sexually frustrated dowager, petty infighting among inheritors, homoeroticism, etc., and motifs of archetypal fascism and Nazism, etc., to keep it from becoming totally insipid, they resort to spoofing their own story even as they're telling it. But rather than cleverly crafted comic relief in the midst of what admittedly is elegance of style and diction--rather than match that elegance--the spoofery is just vulgar. The jar of that vulgarity might make you laugh, until you realize, if this is irony, it's just not that funny, and it doesn't seem to be for the sake of anything other than self-spoofery. Hell, the movie doesn't even attain campiness. At times it gives you the sense of being told, ""Oops, you caught us tinkering with leitmotifs and primal archetypes; we'll have to poke fun at ourselves to hide our triteness and banality as story-crafter hacks."" The story is not told from the heart, or if it is, the writer'(s) heart is in the wrong place.Tony Revolori as the lobby boy ""Zero"" is of course the movie's saving grace, and gracefully and sweetly does he play his rôle.Conclusive Ranking: Splendiferousness of set design and conception à la the best children's illustrated books (probably all the more appreciable under the influence of psychotropics or hallucinogens) – 10; Tony Revolori as Zero – 10; Primal archetype capturing – 8; Character development – 4; Plot – 3; Passion – 0; Six criteria total score – 35; Overall rating – 5.8"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 February 2016,10/10,"I am a great admirer of how Wes Anderson and Robert Yeoman use different lenses and camera angles for each era, or just for different scenes. The emphasis of colours in this picture is remarkable, the most vibrant scene in my opinion would be the simple scene in the lift near the introduction. The red and the purple compliment each other brilliantly, I like pictures to be, not minimalistic, just not too overcrowding. I must have watched The Grand Budapest about 4 times, and yet, i still laugh at the sometimes bluntness of Gustave, or the will reading scene where the 'fighting' ends the scene. Marvellous. I have watched a few films in which Wes collaborates with Robert and the various group of actor that have been repeatedly included in productions, and they are mostly the same; artistic, exciting and original. The use of books in the film looks good, with a close up focus of books whenever they are seen shows great detail. The use of different era's at the start and end of the film gives real perspective."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 October 2014,1/10,"i was desperately trying to find something positive to say about this movie, but in vain.It is one of the silliest movies i've ever seen. And i've seen a lot, believe me. For most of the time i had to look at a nose,filling half the screen, that constantly reminded me of the 'arc of triumph' in Paris. The only thrill was trying to be the first to guess which actor was appearing in the next scene. What were those actors thinking when they joined this project ? I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, and when i woke up the nose was still there. What is the purpose of this so called piece of art ? Annoying people to death ? I would have preferred water-boarding over this. A wast of time, a waste of money and a disgrace to the human mind."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,28 May 2016,10/10,"Whenever a film has perfect control over its tone, setting, camera-work, dialogue, and performances, you don't even notice the running time. It's therefore even more pleasing that the madcap caper film that is The Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't outstay its welcome – and gives a fine farcical romp in the process.Back in the 1930s, the eponymous Grand Budapest Hotel is run by fastidious concierge Monsieur Gustave (Fiennes) who's just taken on a new lobby boy, the aptly named Zero (Revolori). He runs the hotel like a tight-knit military unit, catering to the outrageous demands of the rich and wealthy. But when one of these clients, the fabulously wealthy Madame D. (Swinton), dies, and Gustave is framed for her murder, he and Zero must go on the run from D's homicidal brothers Dmitri (Brody) and Jopling (Dafoe) after they suspect D left her inheritance to Gustave instead of them.Unfortunately, describing the plot as I have above doesn't really convey anything about what the film actually feels like. It's light in tone, yet such serious situations as the theft of a painting, a prison break, and a shootout in the hotel lobby take place. The gloriously detailed sets, some bright and gaudy, some dark and foreboding, perfectly set the atmosphere for each scene. Throughout it all, the kinetic camera movement and finely tuned movements of the actors always give the impression that the chaos, such as it is, is still organised.And underpinning it all is the tragic figure of Gustave, whose outward fussiness give way to a tender core as his relationship with Zero (his protégé) deepens through circumstance. Almost innumerable cameos from other famous stars make this a veritable ""did you spot that?"" game, but all serve a purpose, and all serve the main story. Coming in at surprisingly well under two hours, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best movies of 2014."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 November 2014,4/10,"I was really looking forward to this movie, having seen the promising trailer. However, watching this movie is another story. I found it very painful and was glad when it was finally over, in my opinion complete waste of time. The reasons are as follows: 1) The movie is boring from the very beginning to its very end. 2) Predictable: many things happen but who cares? 3) Having not read the review I would not recognize this is a comedy. Is there anything funny at all? 4) The plot is very poor, the story does not make any sense even if it were just a wild fantasy. 5) What am I suppose to take out of this movie? A number of nice pictures? Is it not too little? 6) The movie is full of stars. However, I am afraid it does not help at all. In summary, I really regret watching this movie. I really looked forward to seeing it but in the end it spoilt a day for me."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 November 2014,10/10,"I have always heralded the cinematic achievements of Wes Anderson's films. Recently, following a dental procedure, my mouth frozen and immobile, I did a rare thing; I went to the movies alone. The movie I chose was ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" As always, Mr. Anderson exceeded my expectations. This movie may be his best. The story is perfect. The dialogue is masterful. The images are inspiring, and the cast is staggering in scope and talent. I'm now watching it at home for the second time and even now, while still alone, all of the above statements remain confidently the same. Regardless of your dental situation, you should see this movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,20 June 2017,10/10,"When I first saw The Grand Budapest Hotel, I wasn't acquainted with Wes Anderson.Surprisingly, my first Wes Anderson experience was his best movie ever. After watching I realized that he is the one that I'm looking for.The cinematography,colors, musics,casting everything was awesome.I have watched immediately all of his movies in a week. This week was probably one of the best week in my life. If we are going to talk about movie-it's typical Wes Anderson movie- You may think that it's simple and average movie from its plot summary, but Wes Anderson movies don't provide meaning from the point of script view. The real meaning of Wes Anderson movies was hidden in its visuals."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 December 2014,4/10,"I admire the effort and meticulous planning that goes into his scenes. It's a breath of fresh air to see a director take passion in the colour palette of a film and stylise it so. However, what happens to your actors when they can only walk either vertically or horizontally? It becomes flat. I get the overwhelming impression that Anderson has planned his scenes so much so that there is absolutely no spontaneity. I think this is probably the most frustrating film I have ever seen, mainly because of the amount of effort that has gone into it but the lack of exploration given to the actors over arches the entire production. It's close, but miles off at the same time. I literally had to turn it off half way through after the 100th symmetrical scene or a shot in profile / head on. What had happened to exploring the 3 dimension world the film is shot in. I actually feel like within 30 minutes his direction becomes lazy and he has forgotten what the emotion of film is all about. Incredible scenes are lost because of the direction being so caught up in its own aesthetic. It's almost like watching Pac man for 2 hours. Shame, obviously a great script."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,2 March 2015,1/10,"The worst movie i ever seen. Has a line of action quite good, colorful screens , but the movie itself is awful. You are expecting to get some action , you have it but it's unsatisfying.It let's you cold. The entire film keeps you waiting but at the end , I was bored. Inginious filming , made screen by screen. Also 7 of my friends have the same opinion. One of them had watched only 20 min . This are my opinions.I don't watch a movie to evaluate each role in part , or it's making , or the costumes. I watch a movie , and a good one for me is that has a story ,and the entire movie doesn't make me bored."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,5/10,"I was dragged to this film without any prior knowledge of it. I accepted the challenge (as sometimes I have been introduced to some of my most favorite films in this very manner) and went to the theater with my friends accordingly.The film is done in typical Wes Anderson fashion - lavish sets with dark, almost dreary colors that appear as though they were designed in the 1940s and 1950s, quirky characters with weird pasts, and a strange plot that doesn't really reveal itself until the end of the film.One of my major struggles with Wes Anderson's style is that oftentimes he makes the characters so quirky that you don't really feel anything for any of them. This film falls into that very same tragic issue. While I liked Ralph Fiennes character Gustave, I simply didn't care about him in the slightest. Zero was the token ""normal"" character that Wes Anderson throws into the mix, and unfortunately he was so contrastingly normal that I didn't even want to see him on the screen. The myriad of cameos in the film were delightful for the moments they occurred, but as the film went on those characters were easily forgotten.Now don't get me wrong, I love quirky characters, but I prefer them to be realistically quirky in a manner where calling attention to that quirkiness causes me to shake my head or squirm in my seat from embarrassment. A great example of this is the set of characters in Napoleon Dynamite, and even Wes Anderson's The Fantastic Mr Fox. However, the characters in Grand Budapest Hotel did not behave in a realistic manner.In typical Wes Anderson fashion, the film lacked any real laugh-out-loud moments. The theater remained pretty quiet throughout the film, and people oftentimes chuckled at different moments. I, unfortunately, fell victim to my friend looking at me at moments he thought was funny and giving me that ""why aren't you giggling too"" look.Giving high marks to a Wes Anderson film is always a difficult chore for me, even when I truly enjoy one of his films. I'm saddled by the fact that I really don't ever feel like I would seek out to watch a film of his a second time, and Grand Budapest Hotel certainly leaves me with no desire to watch it again. This film isn't a bad one by any means, but I wouldn't consider it a great one either. To me, it falls into the average category - watchable, but not re-watchable."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 March 2016,9/10,"Excellent movieOne of the best camera moving i ever saw. nearly every camera movement is something special its flowing like water and giving the scenes more Pepper or different feelings. beautiful introduction, a bit slow and weird but decorated with firing and frightening moments to hold the tension. a touch of action, comedy, thriller and drama. It missing some more pepper to hold everything together. there are some parts i would wish a bit more seriousness to strengthen the whole thing. for me its some near 10/10 because i love it, but general it could reach 9.0. i am so sad that this movie is not often on TV or more movies of this style would be produced"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 February 2015,6/10,"The notoriously quirky film director Wes Anderson strikes again with his latest academy award nominated film, The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film takes place in a fictional world set in the 1930's between World Wars and depicts the eccentric life of Gustave H (played by Ralph Fiennes), the hotels concierge and his sidekick known as lobby boy. As credit to Mr. Andersons talents he has assembled a star studded cast with brief appearances from major Hollywood actors such as Bill Murray, Jude Law, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, and Willem Dafoe just to name a few. This film tells the humorous adventure story of a hotel concierge and his apprentice lobby boys' journey as they steal a priceless painting and attempt to outrun the many adversaries that try to get in their way. The underlying theme throughout this movie is bonding through mentorship. Although Gustave is not the best role model from a moral standpoint, he immediately sees himself in the young lobby by and takes him under his wing. Through their crazy adventures together they learn to rely on each other and eventually Gustave lets his young apprentice know how proud of him he is. Virtually every scene in this film ties back into the theme; these two characters are completely reliant on one another. A great example of this is the prison scene where lobby boy aids in Gustave's escape only to be lectured for not being prepared enough. Later in the film lobby boy saves the day when the pair sneak back into the hotel to retrieve their prized painting. While watching this film I am reminiscent of the theme in life aquatic (coincidently another Anderson film) where another corky character named Captain Zissou takes the crew under his wing for one last crazy journey teaching them along the way. Wes Anderson directs his films in a very unique way. The color used in this film is what really stood out to me as a viewer. Although this movie was a little dark in humor the colors were vivid and plentiful, perhaps purposely done to contrast the heavy parts of the storyline. The hotel itself is pink in a setting of a snowy and gray mountaintop town; this seems to underline the tone of the film perfectly. Another impressive technique in this film was the angles used. The director did a fantastic job of making the scary characters more daunting by shooting them from the ground up, specifically Joplin (Willem Dafoes character). The chase scenes made a very small man seem very scary by portraying him in dark colors and low angles giving off the appearance of extreme power and fear. In conclusion I feel this movie was very well directed and the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Although I don't care for this type of film it was interesting and at time hilarious. The theme stays consistent throughout this film and has a solid ending the leaves everyone happy."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,30 April 2015,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a story about human nature. It is told in a manner that portrays the end of the journey first, and then retrofits how the ending came to be. First, we meet an older version of Author (Tom Wilkinson) of the story who is adamant that the succeeding story was exactly as it was told to him. Then, we meet Author's younger self, play by Jude Law. The setting now moves into another period in which we meet Mr. Moustafa played by F. Murray Abraham. The Grand Budapest has seen better days and has very few guests to speak of. Author and Mr. Moustafa meet during the day and agree to have dinner later that evening, in order to shed light on Author's curiosity of Mr. Moustafa past. During the dinner, Mr. Moustafa begins his story, which takes place in what appears to be the early 1930s, by introducing us to a man name M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). We then see a young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) meeting M. Gustave and interviewing for a lobby boy position at the Grand Budapest. During this process we are privileged to a glimpse of how M. Gustave operates as well how efficient his staff is at providing the very best service to the guests. This type of behavior carries throughout the film, giving it distinctive cinematic perspectives on the emotional actions throughout. For example, when M. Gustave calls upon Ivan (Bill Murray) and The Society of Crossed Keys. The background light is remains equal from the time the M. Gustave makes the official request, until the time that Ivan picks them up, indicating the speed of one of the original social networks. Turning to the techniques used to support the theme. First, was the motif of dark colors that surround the villains, while the white color provides a sense of innocence demonstrated by Agatha's (Saoirse Ronan) wardrobe. A gold dress was used to signify the wealth of Madame D (Tilda Swinton), while the Gray uniforms that Henkels (Edward Norton) and his men wore represent that they were conflicted with their duties. This contrasts the black uniforms that last set of soldiers were wearing, giving me a sense that the scene was likely going to end badly. In addition to the wardrobe selection, the choice to use black and white to show M. Gustave's demise added relevance to theme by enhancing the morose behavior humans sometimes exhibit.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells as magnificent story in a unique manner that stretches over many generations. It depicts people treating each other in the very best manner, but also demonstrates the other extremity."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 July 2015,10/10,"Wes Anderson creates a beautiful, intriguing world I wish I could visit. As per usual, the cinematography and colors are beautiful. Gorgeous costumes fit each character and scene, along with adding a whimsical, playful feel to the film. His colorful settings build a marvelous and captivating picture that intrigued me and left me wanting more. The movie begins with several frame stories, leaving me to wonder where this plot was ACTUALLY going. (Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the depth and characters of each plot, all of which serve their purpose well.) When we arrive at the final story, featuring young Zero and M. Gustave (portrayed flawlessly by Ralph Fiennes), I felt compelled to continue. Many complain about the shallow characters, but Gustave seemed very deep. His pretentious, passionate, unpredictable personality combined with hints of sadness and poetry proved simultaneously comedic, heart-breaking, and touching. I sympathized with him, and, of course, our other protagonist: fumbling, awed Zero, who develops into a respecting apprentice and, in times of need, a quick-thinking and helpful comrade to Gustave. Adrien Brody pulls off a slightly creepy and violent character as a classic, greedy relative with a deep hate for Gustave. Zero's love interest, Agatha, is a cute, brave, and smart-- also marred with a birthmark in the shape of Mexico (another flourishing touch, only in a Wes Anderson movie.)Another big complaint about the movie was its ""lack of comedy"", yet it being labeled a comedy. Parts of the film are so purposely outrageous, it's hard NOT to laugh. Bits of awkwardness, sarcasm, profanity, bluntness, and chaos make it enjoyable and hilarious. I'll never get sick or bored of this movie. It is also my first Wes Anderson movie, which introduced me to Anderson's other films, (which I highly recommend-- particularly Moonrise Kingdom and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.) Ralph Fiennes, Edward Norton, Tony Revolori, Adrien Brody, Saoirse Ronan and Willem Dafoe perform wonderfully. 10/10!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 September 2015,10/10,"I have watched this movie seven times in five days!During the time I was watching Grand Budapest hotel, I was sick of shooting commercial films, but when I saw Wes Anderson's fantastic cinematography I told myself, hey I can do something like this! This movie got me back into my feet and made me love filmmaking again. Grand Budapest is an inspiration to all filmmakers!I couldn't stop watching this movie because it is like reading a book! Visual storytelling at its finest. Every detail is obsessively compulsive from set design, story and audio!I always have Grand Budapest Hotel on my iPhone and will definitely watch it again on my next flight!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,31 August 2019,8/10,"Light hearted in its depth, fantastic humour. Throughly enjoyed Jude Law in his bystander role."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,17 December 2015,9/10,"The plot was purely simple compared to other movies' with twists and turn - an adventure of a young man (but believe me, he was none of those handsome brave men out there, but still, he was ridiculous but charming at the same time), however I enjoyed it very much. Everything was perfect with a nice touch of imperfection. What perhaps impressed me most was the color schemes and the set up - you must watch it to feel it. Every scene was a little work of art, so sophisticated and phenomenal. Each color, each item seemed to be there for a reason - they mixed and blended with each other very well. Good acting is counted tool. All characters were portrayed well, everyone in the movie had their own aura and colors that lasts. After months of watching it, it would be still possible to recalled who was who. In conclusion, this is a nice and short movie - a work of art that welcomes those who are fed up of the colorless and boring world out there. An classic adventure never do wrong."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,10 January 2016,9/10,"Other than reading a couple of quick reviews of this movie I had no real idea of what I was going to watch. I was not familiar with this director, Wes Anderson, though I did know most of the actors. The best way I could describe this movie would be Stylish Cinema all the while walking the line between being a classic and absurdity. It does it extremely well. The movie is set in a fictitious location somewhere in Eastern Europe between WWI/II and portrays a bygone era of opulence and old world manners. The primary location is set in a luxurious hotel replete with a staff whose primary purpose is to look after the guests. Early in the movie we realize we are being told a story. The beginning of the movie is set in the 60's after the hotel is basically run down and then switches to the mid 30's which is where the majority of the movie takes place. The main character is played by Ralph Fiennes who is the concierge of the hotel. While he is the focal point the cameos by other well- known actors were plentiful and varied, not to mention eccentric.The movie is a lament for bygone days and an era which we shall never see again while also being somewhat of a parody. A couple of the more memorable quotes from the movie:The golden age that Zero is evoking never really existed. ""His world had vanished long before he even entered it"". ""He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace,"" one character remarks of another near the end of the movie,"" suggesting this may sometimes be the best we can do.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it made me want to watch some of the director's previous films and too watch this film again which is a rarity for me. Highest Marks"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 January 2016,8/10,"I know it is hard for so many of you to be impartial after you have sung all the praises of Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums. But that is the joy of movies they speak to us differently. Personally I appreciated those earlier ones but have only truly come to love Anderson since Life Aquatic and Grand Budapest, this is truly one of my favorites. The framing in the cinematography was one of my favorite things here so rigid and fixed in every scene it was a character of it's own. The dryness and lack of any bold charisma by each of the characters was brilliant and lent itself to make you want to delve in and find more to pick out about each character. It has to be seen again and again to pick up all the subtle nuances. Personally I think he is gaining a maturity to his projects that is very appealing and somewhat missing in earlier works. Well to each his own I guess but I must say GBH is my favorite Anderson film"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,4 March 2016,4/10,"This movie is weird, boring and stupid. I am surprised it has 8.1 score, even if it is not my type of movie I still cannot rate it too high, the story is trivial there is nothing special about the movie, the only thing is that is strange and non-ordinary. I think the maximum I can give is 4, just because of some nice scenes and colors. Otherwise it is not interesting it is not funny just boring. Sorry. Also strange is the format, it comes 1.37:1 I guess to look like it was made back in the pre WWI years. Nevertheless I did not like that too. I look at the reviews and I just cannot share the opinion, they say great movie that puts them back in that times and great play and so on, I did not see that myself"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,16 February 2020,9/10,The movie seems to be surprise to the viewers. From the extraordinary cast to the terrific screenplay all the way up to the phenomenal direction. The storytelling will engage you in humor alongside drama. It is a must watch for the cinema lovers.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 October 2016,9/10,"Overall a great movie! Personally I would have used lesser known actors for some characters (quit Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jude (L)aw(ful), Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe), as they tend to affect the credibility of the story and bring nothing of a surplus to this movie. Ralph Fiennes (should have won an academy award with this one, for what it's worth) & Tony Revolori were truly outstanding, Jeff Goldblum & cat, Tilda Swindon & Adrien Brody delivered a fine performance too. The screenplay was very well-written, though reading through the reviews, some viewers found it to be pretentious; I do not agree with them at all. The visuals and photography were just stunning. A little bit of occultism going on here and there, but then, we're getting' used to that."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,21 October 2019,10/10,"This movie is such a pleasure to watch, not only visually but also emotionally. The cinematics and editing of this spectacular movie is astonishing and hightens the audiences emotions to the characters. The cast is superb which is complemented with an amazing script. Would highly recommend this film and enjoy to those who are about to watch!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 January 2019,10/10,"A beautiful, well crafted film with great attention to detail and excellent pace. The accompanying score works an absolute treat setting both time and place. What a wonderful film, Well done."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,23 November 2019,,"If you want to feel smarter than other people, even though you are not, then this is the perfect movie for you!"
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,1 March 2017,8/10,"Before watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", I have never seen a movie that combined a love story, ridiculous moments, dark humor, and colorful characters, especially shown in breathtakingly beautiful scenes. Although there is so much to love, I personally think the characters, the cinematography, and the dynamic story are what make it Wes Anderson's best film. From young Zero, all the way to Gustave's fellow inmates in prison, the characters each have a unique flair about them. And of course, if you are familiar with Anderson's work, he has filled this movie to brim with visual beauty. I feel like I'm walking through a painting each time I watch it. Also, Anderson managed to incorporate so much different themes, details, and several story lines that develop within.Whether he is the character you root for, or the evil one, each of the characters have been made exceptionally. The young hero of our story is Zero. He is the teenaged assistant to the concierge: Gustave. Zero is the small, skinny Indian teen who does exactly as he is told. While Gustave is the boss of the Hotel, keeping it in tip-top shape, taking care of any guest's needs. The movie ultimately revolves around these two and we are able to learn about the deep hidden secrets and mysteries of Gustave. Gustave's intelligent ""posh"" British humor was outrageously funny. As the audience, we get to see how Zero learns the ins and outs of running a hotel and learning more about people and life through his adventures. And in broad terms, the details of each character's outfit is what truly wowed me. Each time that I have watched this movie, I have noticed a new small detail in someone's costume that shows just a tad more about their identity. Thus, the Oscar for Best Achievement in Costume Design fortifies the importance of appearance. The attention to detail and the range of characters and what the audience can see about them adds to the greatness.Even the non artistic viewer can appreciate the undeniable beauty in each scene. In fact, I think it is Anderson's best work because it is the most ""Wes Anderson-y"". His distinct framing and screenplay is very unique and out of the box for most movies in modern cinema. If you are familiar with his style, you could watch any moment of GBH and know instantly that it's an Anderson flick. But, his individuality and homage to film during the 1930s, roughly the setting of the movie, is what makes the viewer feel a more authentic experience. Anderson plays with different aspect ratios that were most commonly used for the specific decade in which the story is taking place. This is a brilliant touch, and rare in Hollywood movies today. Also, his use of bright, saturated colors and arranging them to complement and contrast are aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. The reoccurring light and happy colors contrast and emphasize the dark themes in the story. What I like the most about the screenplay and cinematography is the symmetry. The way that a majority of the scenes incorporate shapes and all the design elements to work for each other is truly masterful. Personally, my favorite scene is when there is a chain of concierges from different hotels calling each other in order to aid Gustave. The simplicity of shapes and using different colors is pleasing to watch, and really shows off Anderson's art.The plot of the film was the meatiest of the Anderson movies that I have seen, with lots of different conflicts and excitement. The main story of the movie is Gustave running the hotel between the World Wars in Europe along with the chase for a priceless renaissance painting. Although the action and plot is great to watch unravel, the small themes and little side stories really impress me. We see the coming of age story in Zero. As we watch him learn through experiences that teach him how to run a hotel and eventually become the owner of the GBH. And we see the different ideas of love, coming from young Zero experiencing love for most likely his first time, and eventually marrying the girl despite their young age and short time together. On the other hand, there is Gustave's love life, where he is romantic with many of the old wealthy widowed women who stay in the hotel occasionally, mainly for his love. Perhaps, Anderson is saying about love and relationships with the different types shown in this movie. It could be the spontaneous and brash decision making that you can make when you fall for someone in an instant. Or, possibly the slow, methodical, elderly prize driven lust that some may crave. It's truly up to the individual to decide.Personally, the main reason I fell in love with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was for the cinematography and art within, but I couldn't help but enjoy seeing the characters and watching the story. I liked that with all the humor, darkness, and other factors, there was still a lot to think about after watching the film as well. I hope everyone can carve out an hour and half sometime to watch my favorite movie, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."""
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 July 2017,9/10,"The dialogue is so rich that one must stifle glee lest the next bon mot be missed. Tastefully bawdy, filled with innuendo, intellectually low brow and fun. We loved the characters and the old fashioned, very vaudevillian running gags. This is a wonderful film for couples, even a first date, the clever adult inferences were seen somewhat differently by my wife, leading to lively post viewing conversation."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 January 2015,1/10,"I am shocked how well this movie has done among IMDb users and critics. The cast is amazing, but the movie is truly terrible. I walked out of Rushmore and would have done the same here. The characters were annoying, the dialog pointless and I was just waiting for it to end. Bleh.I did not understand why any of the characters acted the way the did. The little cuts that Anderson employees so freely for dramatic effect just seemed pointless. There was a sequence where there were cuts between different hotel managers that was funny through two cuts and then just dragged on and on as each manager had to stop what he was doing and put his Boy in charge. That is this movie in a nutshell -- it dragged on and on. That could have been interesting to see how a whole network of hotel managers could have been activated, but it just ends up being pointless."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 February 2018,8/10,"Great movie! It was funny, very exciting, crazy, great locations and violent. It is a must."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,3 June 2018,9/10,"What a lovely n incredible film it is! I'm truly amazed by its beautiful scenes n ironic story. It may look just like a perfect cake, but you can hardly know how dark n cruel in its making process behind the pretty surface. And the movie exactly show it."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,12 March 2018,9/10,"In his latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson does an incredible job of telling an ugly story taking place in an even uglier time in a beautiful and light-hearted way. Receiving a 93% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, The Grand Budapest Hotel is not only loved by fans, but also critically acclaimed. Taking place in the 1930s, the movie tells the story of a lobby boy, Zero, and his mentor, M.Gustave. M. Gustave manages a fantastical ski resort where he spends time meeting the needs of the hotel's old, rich, blonde occupants. Coming from zero, Zero is an immigrant who fled his war-ridden home to come to Zubrowka, the fictional European country in which the film is set.
 Alongside the adventures of Zero and M. Gustave is another story: that of the violent shift of culture in Western Europe during the World Wars. When the movie starts, it depicts a society of structure, nobility, and social hierarchy. From the beginning, Anderson portrays a hierarchy even within the hotel, with M. Gustave near the top, staying in a grand room with a grand bed, and Zero at the very bottom, living in a room the size of a closet. Everyone treats each other with respect, and everyone knows their place in society. Everything is structured. As the movie progresses, this theme is still apparent, yet things begin to change. For example, while traveling, Zero and M. Gustave's train is stopped in the middle of a barley field. It is then boarded by militarized police, who are seemingly ready to arrest Zero for lack of legal documentation. However, before they can do anything, they are stopped by their chief, who is a friend of M. Gustave's and gives Zero a note stating he is legally allowed in the country. This scene hints at the shift in the current society. At the end of the film, the plot makes it apparent that the shift in culture is nearly complete when a similar train scene is displayed, with Zero and M. Gustave's train car stopped again, but this time it is boarded by a stand-in for an SS death squad. Yet again, they are about to arrest Zero, but this time M. Gustave hands them the letter from their last barley field pullover. A member of the death squad proceeds to shred the note and bash Zero with the butt of his gun, symbolizing the near completion of the shift in society. 
 The beauty of the cinematography ude of a light-spirited sense of humor, although contrasting the ugly themes portrayed in the film, make the movie very charming. The excellent use of still and tracking shots, symmetry, colors, and beautiful sets allows for a stunning style of film that grants each shot an oil painting look. For example, at the beginning of the film, Anderson launches a colorful long shot of the hotel, giving a sense of its size and grandeur, followed by a tracking shot from the gondolas all the way through the resort, displaying the world it contains. Additionally, the humor is consistently subtle and funny, with skits ranging from the mysterious Society of the Crossed Keys, to the hunt for a strange yet priceless painting, Boy With Apple. The inclusion of humor and cheery tones in the film allow The Grand Budapest Hotel to be very enjoyable and fun to watch, even though the film tells a story of violence in a violent time."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 July 2018,,"This film is gorgeous. It is visually astounding. Wes Anderson has always written fantastic screenplays and this may be his best one yet. The story involves an hotel concierge M.Gustave and his protege Zero, M.Gustave is highly respected in the hotel business and even manages to become very close to feeble old ladies, when one of them dies, M.Gustave becomes the chief suspect in her murder.The dialogue is great, very funny and delightful. The story takes many unexpected twists and turns and is perfectly paced, with many cameos from many famous actors. Ralph Fiennes was phenomenal in the movie, his performance is certainly Oscar worthy, whilst many of the other performances in the film were great such as Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody, Ralph Fiennes remains outstanding. The shots in this movie are incredible, The Grand Budapest is fantastically directed and the cinematography is in some scenes is jaw dropping. This one of the best looking movies of 2014 and most certainly deserves a best cinematography Oscar nomination. The use of color is extremely well done in this movie, the scenes shot in the hotel are bright and colorful to represent a happy sweet tone, whilst outside the hotel is shot with a bleak and sort of grey tone.Overall this is certainly one of Wes Anderson best movies, with gorgeous visuals, splendid acting and a fantastic script, this is easily one of the best movies of the year, very funny, incredibly sweet and all with Wes Anderson's flair. The Grand Budapest is a film not to be missed."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,15 January 2015,1/10,Rented on video and nearly switched off. Don't know what the fuss is all about. Didn't like Moonrise Kingdom either. Rubbish. How this type of film wins a Golden Globe confirms either I am completely out of touch or the awards are. Not seen Birdman but put off by the fact it won a Golden Globe. Saw a useless film starring Brad Pitt called Tree of Life or something similar. Waste of money producing. Then again Shakespeare in Love and Ordinary People won Oscars for best movie. Seem to remember Forrest Gump beat Pulp Fiction. Wes Anderson films are not for me. Pretentious drivel. Rather watch Wes Craven and that's saying something.
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,7 June 2018,9/10,"This is simply another marvelously crafted piece, specifically the 8th, by auteur Wes Anderson, whose artistic flavor and ability manifest in its meticulously arranged camerawork and grandiose sets, the rich nature of the soundtrack, and the gliding pace, given even more vitality by the performances of a straight-up stupendous cast. The combined presentation is phenomenal, I'll argue. From the opening shot, all attention is placed on the scenery, a motley of color and positively baroque environments. From the floridity of the Grand Budapest Hotel to the brutalist nature of the prison, there's intense mise en scène all around; Wes Anderson did incrediblely well to build a world, boxy yet vast. All of this is well-framed under the lucid camerawork, a sort of hovering betta delicately absorbing both the most penitent scenes and most beautiful scenery at once as it follows the cast throughout, as they indulge in their eccentricity and plots, to the tune of the balalaika-heavy soundtrack, which can range from bubblingly mellow to bubblingly anxious. The acting is mostly underplayed but by no means diluted; the humor and general dialogue is executed in a natural yet purposeful cadence, coupled with fluid motion. I've had a couple of chortles watching, and was heavily invested throughout. I honestly can't recommend this enough. Now, issues some might have: The plot acts only as a vehicle for all other facets of the film itself, and by extension the characters may come across as superficial. I honestly don't view this as a defect; I figured the intention was to impress the audience with an absurd caper and enjoyed it greatly under that assumption. All the same, because of this, the film is sorta hit-or-miss, depending on what you're looking for or to resonate with. I suppose most of all Wes Anderson films are. Still, I recommend giving this a watch, if only to appreciate the style that penetrates this film immensely."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,5 February 2019,10/10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favorite film of all time. I do not have a single problem with the film. It has incredible acting, an incredibly engaging story, and wonderful visuals. I don't know about you because this is just a personal preference of mine, but I absolutely love Wes Anderson's style, and TGBH is his style at its most prominent. This film just has such a unique visual flare to it. The Grand Budapest Hotel is perfect in every way. For a movie that's really just about how someone gains possession of a hotel, I could never, in a million years, think of a move creative idea."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,13 June 2018,10/10,"This is what filmmaking is all about. The acting, script and cinematography are perfect. 
Don't miss this one."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,25 March 2021,8/10,"Fast, fluid, immersive, funny.. Primitive visual effects but that's OK. Quality acting and carefully tuned cinematography, conceal all the flaws. I loved camera angles. This movie will be remembered in my memory as a good and funny movie."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,8 April 2021,8/10,"What a great movie - not a whole lot to say cause I don't want to spoil it - but watch it - great story , classic symmetry and beautiful scenes and entertaining."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,26 December 2018,10/10,"Stunning, Beautiful, Witty and Warm, these would be only a few words of which describe the grandeur of ;The Grand Budapest Hotel' a story told retrospectively by a writer whom found himself being a told a retrospective story himself.From the bold acting of M. Gustave and the star studded cast with each vibrant roles, makes this film beautiful. I found myself watching it several times as Wes Anderson's use of camera techniques and story telling are tremendous. The use of Cinema is often wasted in the hands of directors where a big budget will leave you feeling unsatisfied or tithe you over for two hours. However, This work of art gives cinema a new meaning, a classic meaning. More art lesser the mindless action. Each scene belongs and feels like time and creativity was put into it.Too many times have I watched a film and been left cheated from my money. Not these title though. It was a story that I loved and still do.Would I recommend this title?Yes, In a heart beat."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,9 December 2018,10/10,"This is by far one of the best films i have seen to understand cinema as . a language. This also helped me understand a lot of things about framing, composition, lighting and a lot more.
Wes Anderson is . no doubt one of the best director in the entire world."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,29 October 2021,10/10,"Visually delightful but may lack some character depth.Awesome visuals and remarkable scenes with quirky humor and energetic rhythm.The characters are remarkable, nicely casted and greatly written. Although they're good, deeply inside I feel like they are built with superficiality and lack some depth. Of course I am not talking about the main characters, those are simply so well explored through the movie. But there are some secondary characters that I feel like I only remember for the reason being that the casted actor is so remarkable. That's, of course, only the way I feel about some characters, but that's me.The color palette is absolutely gorgeous and the composition made me analyze every single scene, appreciating the symmetry and well thought scenery.The story moves along in a fast pace, with the palette helping you to keep track of the progress, making every place and moment with a distinctive color composition. I think that's the first time I watched an entire film without ever thinking about being bored.A feast for the eyes but at the same time I wanted to feel more depth in secondary characters, I see it as a trait of the film itself, as it doesn't ruins or twists my experience in any perceivable way.Thanks for the great (as always) work, Wes."
THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL,18 January 2019,10/10,"Absolutely amazing! Great casting, great story, great acting, amazing dialogues, excellent music, loved all about this movie."
